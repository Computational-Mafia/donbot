I felt at that time that the discussion hasn\u2019t become too serious. As I mentioned above, I stand rather neutral about yabbaguy\u2019s attempt to create discussion (and yes yabbaguy, I do see the townie aspect in there, I\u2019m just not sure if it\u2019s the best way to start Day 1) and please don\u2019t get me started about the rather ridiculous \u201ccase\u201d against tarsonisocelot because of her welcome post. Hence my reluctance to step into these two discussion threads; my initial intent was to watch and get the whole picture. By the way, my RVS choice was made by skimming the nickname list and picking a name that struck me in any way and well, \u201cMe=Weird\u201d just did that. I didn\u2019t know back then that she was V/LA (the mod only wrote this in #27), otherwise I surely would have picked another player for RVS voting.<br><br>My second post (third post actually) was meant to be provocative (hooray it worked), yet has actually three reasons behind it:<br><ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\"><li>His first post starts a small case against yabbaguy and then he turns around and votes StefanB. I honestly fail to see the logic behind that, calling someone scummy and yet voting someone else <span style=\"font-style: italic\">without giving any reason whatsoever</span>. RVS was definitely over at that point so either he failed to see this or he wanted to provoke and/or attract attention.</li><li>In his second post he just bows down to imaginality\u2019s and [L]\u2019s reactions and votes who <span style=\"font-style: italic\">they</span> are suspecting, with some sarcasm being the icing. Now I may not be a big fan of sarcasm in Mafia Scum, hence my \u201cdon\u2019t like the attitude\u201d. But my real problem with this post is that he looks opportunistic, already early in the game. Opportunism is always scummy.</li><li>In this fourth post he accuses me of not participating much (a fact I accept) and implies that I should be watched more. And indeed some OMGUS moment arose in me then (if you prefer to call it \u201ctouchy\u201d, go ahead), I mean, this guy has hit my scumdar twice in three posts and then he accuses <span style=\"font-style: italic\">me</span> of being anti-town by not participating? This was the last straw so I voted him.</li></ol><br>I disagree with my third post being useless. I confronted yabbaguy with my point of view on his honey pot in order to clarify my stand on him. I think you went a bit too far by implying that stating my opinion and expecting a reaction is not useful. Regarding the lurkers part, I wanted to rectify Surprise_Carcinogen\u2019s misconception. I mean, he stated it, I checked it and found it false \u2013 why should I not call him out on this?<br><br>So crazypianist1116, please elaborate what about my statements you actually found scummy.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Jase wrote:</cite>Obvious omgus and vote hopping on top of it all, godamn, this is almost too easy.<br><br>Seriously though...do you actually have a reason for voting me or am I just getting on your nerves?</div></blockquote><br>First, for the voting reasons, see above; this should take care of your OMGUS argument. Second, up until now, I fail to see myself vote hopping, especially compared to you. While I have RVS-voted Me=Weird and then switched to you for the reasons above, you have switched your vote from StefanB (which you, by the way, never gave a reason for) to yabbaguy (which you, by the way, never gave a reason for) to me (which you finally did give a reason for); this should take care of your vote hopping argument. Now what was your case against me again?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>yabbaguy wrote:</cite>Uncle Pain, this is extraordinary now. You have to at least realize that there us Town intent in that post. Don't call the post itself anything but that, or you've sorely missed the point.</div></blockquote><br>Yes I realize this. But as I said, I argue that it\u2019s not the best way to start Day 1 in a pro-town way. It just looks forced and you inflict a small stain on your clean slate. I don\u2019t say it\u2019s scummy. I just say it\u2019s unusual to me.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>GroupThink wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Uncle Pain</span></div></blockquote><br>Come on, what is that supposed to mean?

I sometimes tend to interpret avatars and try to correlate this with my findings from their posts. These things distract me. I simply feel better without an avatar that people may use to define me in one way or another."}

Because town players are too busy to care if other people think they're good, only scum come out and want to be good. I'm not telling you \"listen to everything I say.\" I'm saying if I say something, you disagree, and give me a good reason, and I say \"Huh, good point.\" the \"huh, good point\" isn't sarcasm. I actually mean \"good, fucking, point.\"<br><br>You're taking me grossly out of context to the point of misrepping me, and I dislike that two of you are doing it. <br><br><br>Andrew: the reason it's suspicious that you've been ignoring him is that he's at 4 votes, and is one of MANY people's prime targets of suspicion.

I'd almost accept someone not posting anything up until now because they're busy(easter and all) but to cast a vote without saying SOMETHING is suspect at best. I'm also not liking Andrew too much, but I'm hesitant to say anything concrete just yet as most of it is based on what I suspect to be his play style, as it seems the things I dislike about him are true across all of his plays. I still find it suspect, but not enough to knock GT from my <span class=\"noboldsig\">Fos:GroupThink</span>. Also, I'm going to <span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote</span>. Jase's recent posts do such unscummy things as undermining himself in reference to a prior conversation(which was admittedly a pointless one) and attempts to draw people's attention to his own suspiciousness. I'm inclined to think that this is legit town-play, since a scum would try and either deflect or defeat, not ask more people \"what do YOU think about me.\" If he were fishing for scum-assistance, I think it would generally come without being asked for."}

This makes me think that you flinging shit to see what sticks.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>StefanB wrote:</cite>Zdenek: Why are rhetorical questions scummy?<br></div></blockquote><br>The easy answer is my impression is that scum ask them more often than town. However, to be more detailed, asking them is a way to participate in the game without scum hunting, which is good for scum, and they disparage the person you are talking to, so they are a subtle form of mudslinging. However, that was not my main point just now, it's that you were defending asking one, and I don't understand your reasons for doing so.<br><br>I feel like Jase is being intentionally obnoxious and that this recent calling out of people who are ignoring him confirms this. Since he's aware of what he's doing, my read on him at the moment is leaning town because of the willingness he has to draw attention to himself.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Uncle Pain wrote:</cite>Zdenek: Care to give us some reads?<br></div></blockquote><br><br>My strongest reads are Jase and Yabba as town and Surprise Carcinogen and crazypianist as scum."}

And \"I know of the danger of tunneling, but I like my vote on you.\" is a bit suspiciously pre-emptive. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>StefanB 70 wrote:</cite>Unvote<br><br>Yes I have gotten over emotion.</div></blockquote><br><br>Interesting that the timing of this comes after yabbaguy's unvoted StefanB (calling him a tunnelling townie) and after crazypianist1116 said about StefanB, \"The case for yabbaguy makes no sense whatsoever.\" I could see, if StefanB is scum, how he would think this was a good point to back down from his yabbaguy vote and use the tunnelling excuse. <br><br>Rest of this post is also bad. The defense/argument with Zdenek about active lurking seems antsy and jumpy rather than calm. There's a bit of fluffy not-doing-much stuff (e.g. asking GroupThink to say more, commenting that Me=Weird? is V/LA, asking why Uncle Pain doesn't want an avatar). But the really bad bit is:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>StefanB 70 wrote:</cite>I don't think [yabbaguy] is sure town, no, but there are people who are more suspicios.</div></blockquote><br><br>Coming in the post where StefanB has just unvoted yabbaguy, this is plain scummy. If you think someone is more suspicious, name them and vote for them, please. <br><br>It's also a conveniently neutral stance on yabbaguy - \"I don't think he's sure town\" implying you think he's somewhat town, \"there are people who are more suspicious\" implying you still suspect him somewhat. I read that as scum wanting to keep suspicion on as many players as possible."}

There's nothing in that post to indicate clearly who his current top suspects were. \"Hello GroupThink, care to say more?\" isn't obviously \"I think GroupThink is scummier than yabbaguy.\" And while yes, StefanB did name Jase in an earlier post, what he said was, \"Voting [Jase] at the point is a good vote, but there is yabbaguy.\" <br><br>StefanB, if you <span style=\"font-style: italic\">already thought</span> Jase would be a good vote, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">why didn't you when you unvoted yabbaguy?</span> You say you thought you \"could do somethink that helps more,\" but you didn't do anything else, just unvoted.

It's possible for us to pressure you and still be looking at others as well - it's not like we're about to hammer you already. You sound more upset by the attention on you than you have a right to be. <br><br>You're looking a lot scummier to me than the others are right now, and your posts this page have just dug you deeper into that spot, but there are probably at least two other scum around so if you show me reasons to suspect someone else, I'm going to take a look at them.

His pressure on you reads very genuine to me. If there's scum on your wagon it's andrew94 for joining the wagon based on a reason that is either poor or at best minor compared to the other stuff in your posts.

The only things that I find in his play at the moment that I think are telling are his reactions to the votes on him, and my feelings about them are split. Looking at the threads he's participated in, my impression is that he's played in enough games that he should know better than to react like this to a few votes. Just to be clear, I have not examined his play in other games at all. On the one hand, I think there are some reasonable points that can be made against him: his responses to accusations feel over defensive, and he is definitely using appeals to emotion. However, his frustration reads as genuine, and he's continued to give his opinions on people."}

Partly that's an overall impression, a matter of his tone, but some of the contributing factors are:<br><br>(i) his over-focus on the 'active lurking'* point against him, which shifted the focus onto him originally, compared with addressing the scummy aspects of his more recent posts;<br>(ii) appealing to emotion and having a 'defeated' air when he's only at L-4 (the weak townies I've seen 'give up' have tended to do it when they're closer to being lynched than this, though I don't have objective stats on this - that's just been my experience) <br>(iii) the way in which his refusal to argue against the 'genuine' people on his wagon seems like admitting that there are good reasons to want him lynched, and his concern is just to show us why we're wrong about the active lurking thing<br>(iv) seeing Me=Weird's pressure as not genuine and being less concerned about andrew94's doesn't make much sense from a townie (in my opinion), but does from this 'scum caught for the wrong reason' angle, since Me=Weird is the person who's pushed the 'active lurking' point<br><br>* I'm using this as shorthand; I know the actual point is not simply active lurking. <br><br><br>On andrew94, I wasn't all that impressed by his earlier posts (asking questions but not appearing to properly scumhunt, or move his vote to a non-random target), but this post was what stood out to me:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>andrew94 114 wrote:</cite>about stefanb: i dont know about yabba's reaction testing, but i got the sense that he was joking about dont lynch me, then made up the 'reaction test' part after as he went along. because he had a huge 'best ic' tag underneath him, it seems impossible that you can miss that. therefore, stenfanb is scum, because town wouldnt do 'stefan's first post' to an experienced player. HE later states that he did indeed see the best ic sign, and was trying to do a reaction test. this is absolute Bs and i get the feeling that he just wanted to seem like he is doing something<br>therefore unvote vote stefanb </div></blockquote><br><br>There were plenty of good reasons to join the StefanB wagon, but this feels so stretched. 'Town won't ask a player with an award a rhetorical question about a scummy opening post to see what the other player says in response.' I really, really don't think that's a sound claim. This seems like andrew94 reading \"how to be scum 101\" and thinking, \"hmm, if I'm going to get on the wagon and not look opportunistic, I have to come up with an independent reason rather than sheep what the others said.\" <br><br>I don't think StefanB is any more or less likely to be town if andrew94 flips scum, since andrew94 could be opportunistically joining the wagon either to try to get a mislynch if StefanB is town or to earn townpoints for bussing if StefanB is scum. But if StefanB flips scum, iStefanB's reluctance to challenge andrew94 compared with Me=Weird points slightly towards andrew94 also being scum (with StefanB not wanting to simply shift the pressure from him onto his scumbuddy, but rather onto a townie).  <br><br>Going to comment on others in my next post - I don't want to spend all my time on StefanB.

As for the bit about sheeping, I accept your explanation.<br><br>Second bit: I looked back and I saw it, that is a thing that happens. You say you didn't vote me because you voted Uncle Pain, but why would you vote him for something that could have been scum motivated when what you accused me of MUST have been scum motivated? It makes no sense for you not to vote me if you truly believe what you said. I'm calling BS on that. Moving right along, yes I saw your reasoning for accusing SC. Problem is you throw down some support for my wagon and then in the same breath you make an accusation for being on the wagon that you JUST supported. In general it seems like you don't want to be ON my wagon but you still want my wagon to succeed. You then use being on my wagon as points against two other players so you can call them out if my wagon DOES succeed, and YOU get to say \"I told you there was something wrong with that wagon\". Is that about right? Did I leave any part of that out?"}

I can't possibly see why she found no logical reasons for the Jase wagon, and that seems very much to be an excuse after-the-fact; why wasn't she saying that to begin with?  Comes up with an awful reason for her unvote (which was kind of out of the blue and w/o explanation anyway), and admits that she's not following her usual town meta.  She doesn't really seem to do much actually (by her own admission).  Overall, I feel like I just don't have enough information here to make an informed decision.  I'll look at the anti-L cases in a bit more depth, but there might be bigger fish to fry.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">Verdict: Slightly Leaning Mafia</span><br><br>andrew94: I just don't see what andrew has accomplished.  He has what has already been noticed as the worst reasoning for voting Stefan, and beyond that is very centered on Jase for unclear reasons (or reasons that we've long since moved beyond).  I see no real scumhunting here, and indeed little effort to give the appearance of scumhunting.  Oh, and he's failed to respond to any of the comments about his Stefan vote.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">Verdict: Leaning Mafia</span><br><br>crazypianist1116: Few posts, but I actually like what I see.  Is willing to reconsider votes and suspicions, harps on andrew and stefan, is logical and willing to leap into a fray.  I'd like to see more activity, but for now, <span class=\"noboldsig\">Verdict: Leaning Town</span><br><br>imaginality: Tends to stay with the safe wagons, but his reasoning is generally good.  Nice tunnelling of Stefan, and helped to make a strong case.  I want to see the promised examination of others. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Verdict: Leaning Town</span><br><br>Jase: Wow.  Starts off so insanely scummy that I'm surprised a larger wagon never formed, and then turned around and became a fantastic player.  Of his early play I'll say little, but there's quite a bit to glean from later stuff.  There's a lot I could say, but as a form of summary I'll note that <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3005356#p3005356\" class=\"postlink\">Post 168</a> was the moment I decided that he was closer to the town column. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Verdict: Leaning Town</span><br><br>Me=Weird: First to identify what he classifies as a Stefan scumslip, and tends (self-admittedly) to tunnel.  I want his opinion of other people (he's really tunnelling), but I just don't find anything offensive here.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">Verdict: Slightly Leaning Town</span><br><br>Mist7676: For starters, I completely disagree with her opinions on selfvoting; Stefan: you shouldn't selfvote.  Beyond that, Mist is tunnelling Stefan, and barely contributing to that.  Actually, I'm not clear on why you're voting for Stefan.  My assumption is that you reposting imagin's case is an agreement, but you haven't really done any scumhunting yourself.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">Verdict: Null</span><br><br>StefanB: Here we go.  Weird unvote in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2991036#p2991036\" class=\"postlink\">Post #70</a>.  The real nail in the coffin for me is this post (#107):<blockquote><div><cite>StefanB wrote:</cite>Other strange thinks: Post 4 (first playerpost) were did the candyjoke come from? This sounds strange, wouldn't be a day later, but on Saturday it sounded strange.<br>BTW: The treads needs more Crazypianist und Zdenek(3 posts each) and of corse more GroupThink (a vote).<br>Uncle Pain: Sorry forgot to answer your question.<br><br>I did calm my anger.

I would call him a slight townread, at the moment. Would like to watch him, when he isn't arguing with me, unfortunatly hasn't posted since nearly 2 days.</div></blockquote><br>That description of his yabba vote sounds like revisionist history at best.  Also, he's very much sitting on the fence here on the yabba issue, and I don't like that.  He also misunderstands/represents the rhetorical question issue.  I'm sympathetic to the \"frustrated townie\" view here, but overall my <span class=\"noboldsig\">Verdict:Leaning Mafia</span><br><br>tarsonisocelot: How has only yabbaguy jumped on TO?  There is almost no content here.  Just go read the ISO.  Look at how much of TO's writing is fluff, unrelated, or small, unsubstantiated statements.  All of her strongest statements are things that everybody will agree with anyway.  Still has a vote on L, but I'm not sure I could tell you why.  I encourage everybody to read this ISO (it won't take long).  <span class=\"noboldsig\">Verdict: Leaning Mafia</span><br><br>Uncle Pain: Another poster that started weak (possibly to get a reaction), but clearly got better.  I like a lot of his reasoning, particularly this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Uncle Pain wrote:</cite>Aw come on, what is this? First yabbaguy, then Jase, now [L]: you do a scummy mistake and later say \u201cit was all planned to fish for reactions\u201d. I\u2019m sorry guys but this is just a tad too convenient. As much as I see that creating discussion is a valid townie move, I find baiting someone (or anyone) rather scummy because we townies don\u2019t need to pull such tricks to find scum, plus it confuses town. The problem I see for myself here is that I don\u2019t know how to evaluate this in terms of suspicion. I gotta admit that [L]\u2019s trick looks the strangest. Not only because it looks the least planned and most retroactively justified of the three but also since she tried to particularly goad Surprise_Carcinogen. [L], do you have an actual case against him? As far as I see it, you dislike his statements about mafia theory and that\u2019s it\u2026</div></blockquote><br>QFT.  Really.  The number of \"act scummy then say later that I was looking for reactions\" plays is absurd.  Everybody needs to stop using that defense (you'll notice I consider it one of the big strikes against Stefan above).  Overall: good reasoning and solid hunting.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">Verdict: Leaning Town</span><br><br>yabbaguy: The original fake idiocy play, which went off rather well (in his eyes).  I don't really like your player by player list in #151 though.  I don't really see refutations of anti-Stefan cases, nor reasons that imagin is scum (it's not obvious to me that his case is \"a bunch of nonsense\")  Other scum votes are very tentative.  Jumps on TO, so it's unlikely that they are both scum (that would be a rather extreme bus).  I'm unsure here; would be interested to hear others' thoughts.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">Verdict: Null</span><br><br>Zdenek: I'd like to see more, but what I've seen has been good.  Nice arguments concerning L (including what I think to be one of the best summaries of the case).  <span class=\"noboldsig\">Verdict: Leaning Town</span><br><br>Whew, sorry that was so long.<br><br>TLDR: My scumreads are TO, Stefan, andrew, and [L]<br><br>Now, if we're going to stick with either Stefan or [L], I'll have more to say on that matter.  However, I feel that a certain person has been sorely underinvestigated.  So<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: tarsonisocelot</span>"}

Hopefully I'll be able to give a more detailed post tomorrow. I do want to respond to this though.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>[L] wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>crazypianist1116 wrote:</cite>[L], I'm voting for you. If you want, you can refute my case. Regardless I want more votes for you.</div></blockquote>Well, frankly, you've seen me play as scum. I am much....shall we say....different. My town approach is to analyze more... but this game started out so disgustingly that I haven't even done that. I'll be honest - I haven't been involved in the game the way I wanted to be. I'm frustrated. But I'm not giving up on the game because I'm the type to see things through to their end.</div></blockquote><br>Yes, I've seen you play as scum. That does not mean your scum play is completely unique. You could be intentionally playing differently than you were in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=16948&amp;start=0\" class=\"postlink\">Newbie #1082</a> purely in an attempt to throw me off. Or you could just be playing differently as a result of real life. What I'm trying to say here is that your playing differently does not exempt you from being scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>[L] wrote:</cite>Your case against me is somewhat laughable because it is untrue. Let me point out the ways:<blockquote><div><cite>crazypianist1116 wrote:</cite>VOTE: [L]<br>    She's been doing a ton of talking without throwing around suspicion at all. This is particularly scummy behavior. The vote was useless essentially the entire game as it hasn't really been accompanied by much pressure and the unvote came out of nowhere. Also on my scumlist (in no particular order) are Jase, andrew94, Surprise_Carcinogen, and StefanB.</div></blockquote><br>\"ton of talking\": This is laughable because I have 15 posts; two of which had content, and the rest only consisted of votes or up to 3 lines max. That's not a ton of talking by anyone's standards. Personally, I'd lynch people for doing as little talking as me.</div></blockquote><br>Ok perhaps we were mixing up our definitions. By accusing you of doing a \"ton of talking,\" I was accusing you of that which you just described. You were active in the game, but not doing much to help push the game forward.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>[L] wrote:</cite>\"throwing around suspicion\": When one throws around suspicion, they are scum. Townies cast suspicion on those they suspect, not randomly.</div></blockquote><br>Oh boy confusing definitions again. By throwing around suspicion, I did mean actually casting suspicion on people. You however were not doing that. It seemed like you were waiting for a prime target to appear so you could go in and make your case.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>[L] wrote:</cite>\"vote was useless\": My vote on TO was not useless, because it was not a pressure vote. I truly believe she is scum. Currently, I had to remove my vote to see how she behaves. I'm somewhat ambivalent right now, on her.</div></blockquote><br>Your vote was useless because it didn't do anything for the game. You never made a decent case yet you held that vote there for roughly four pages. You never tried to push for TO's lynch, which is scummy behavior considering you were voting her for so long.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>[L] wrote:</cite>\"unvote came out of nowhere\": Yes, it would seem so. But I unvoted her in order to regroup my thoughts and see how she behaves. And saying that this is what I am doing is inconsequential even if she reads it.</div></blockquote><br>I really don't see the reasoning for this. If you've explained it in the past few pages, my apologies.<br><br><br>StefanB, next time can you please try to not post 9 times in a row. Condensing into one post would make life simpler for all of us.<br><br>I'm going to try and make a more comprehensive post within 24 hours."}

While this was certainly true, I do see your point as well. Still, envy is a bad reason to vote someone. In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2993601#p2993601\" class=\"postlink\">#103</a> Me=Weird gave his voting reason which basically boils down to your unvote that looked out of place and inconsequential, plus he refers to imaginality\u2019s <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2993337#p2993337\" class=\"postlink\">#96</a> which includes criticism on your unvote.

Why did that change?</div></blockquote><br>About to reread the next few pages. Got interrupted by falling asleep at my desk.<br>At endof page 3, my vote on [L] was still there from RVS because they hadn't done anything particularly townie. They had five posts of which one corrected the bracketing of their random vote and another contained only an emoticon, of the two with any attempt at content one pointed out that Jase's late RV was weird and the other sheeped Imaginality &amp; andrews reason for voting me. I did not feel the need to change my vote yet as I hadn't seen anyone I was sure deserved it more than [L] or gotten some kind of supertownie vibe from them, current suspicions of them will appear further through the reread. Jase was being suspicious, as stated in my readthrough, but there were others already trying to get more out of him and I wasn't yet sure whether they were just being scummily weird or being actually scummy. My hope was that other better players would get more from them before I chose to change votes or not, which did happen. SC was mainly on the list because of their lurkiness plus being overly defensive about being accused of lurkiness. It wasn't a strong read, but this was page 3.<br><br>I thought that imaginality initially responded badly to the reactionfish, but the second post was less so. The Jase vote was justified at the time for the \"call out scum, then vote a random instead\" weirdness. There wasn't much content from them, but they did attempt to give reasons for their votes. Mostly here it was that others, particularly Jase, had done more suspicious things so I'd stopped thinking much about imaginality. I won't be evaluating every player at every point, but I will attempt to do so for the end of the reread because the main thing I might overlook is non-active lurking. <br><br>This read through will focus mostly on listing the things I think possibly notable, along with some small amount of comments on why. The mentions of tangents are there so people like Jase know that I am not ignoring those posts, but deliberately disregarding them as irrelevant. I do not feel I am good enough at distinguishing useful information from useless, so I'm erring on the side of more information. Later, when I have a full reread done I'll try to refine my reads more. If you spot anything that seems off or you think that I should look more at something specific then say so, I'm better at checking for specific links and so on than D1 stuff. Next post will contain 4-6/7 depending on length."}

The contrast between attacking people on his wagon (e.g. Mist in 152 and Me=Weird in 162) and his 'I know that many townies belive I am scum' comment is more significant than the comment by itself. 193 has an odd contradiction where it seems he's claiming both that he lurks and that he starts discussions early on on Day 1s. And 202's \"Well what exactly would the votes on Jase help town, he would have four not three. What does a vote on someone who will quit the game probably help\" is a poor point, as well as the way he misrepresents my case against him as being mainly about scumpartners. (\"But because nobody has said this to imaginality: Don't be sure of scumpair on day one before the flip.<br>Okay that we[re] imaginalitys good argument right?\") My iso 5-7 give my reasons for suspecting StefanB, none of which were about scumpairs. (At the end of iso7, I said that I suspected <span style=\"font-style: italic\">andrew94</span> for that reason, but I didn't use it as an extra point in my StefanB case.) In 223, I like that StefanB didn't put [L] at L-1 yet - that actually seemed pro-town... except that the final line pointing out how 'ultrascummy' of him it was not to vote throws that into question by linking the reason for not voting with \"I know all hate this but I will be bussy with defending myself, so yes...\" rather than it just being about not wanting the day to end yet. <br><br>Probably the best point in his favour is the way andrew94 and Mist7676 both hopped on his wagon opportunistically, though as I said earlier I could see that as scum bussing almost as much as scum wagoning town, so it's not a very strong argument against StefanB being scum.<br><br>Overall, there's plenty still niggling at me about StefanB and, while I can see there are newbie-tells and communication confusion muddying the waters, if you remove those null tells what's left still looks more scum than town. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Others</span><br><br>C-Worl(andrew94) - jumping on [L] wagon with minimal reasoning isn't a good start.

Are you sure just from your skim that you'd be happy with an [L] lynch if that happened before you'd fully caught up? <br><br>[L] - crazypianist (217 and 244) makes good points against [L], as does Jase (206, 210, and 225) and Zdenek (128 and 154).  224 from [L], aside from Jase's point, is also an unfair response to StefanB's lack of vote as it completely ignores the not-wanting-the-day-to-end possible reason for not voting. I don't feel quite sure enough to switch my vote to [L] yet, but I'm certainly not opposed to an [L] lynch at this point.<br><br>@[L], in 172 why did you say you \"Currently, I had to remove my vote to see how [tarsonisocelot] behaves\"? <br><br>@yabbaguy, is your reason for backing off on [L] only that tarsonisocelet is attacking [L] and is scummier?)<br><br>Prox(Mist(GroupThink)) - I didn't like the way Mist7676 joined the StefanB wagon in 143.

In particular Me=Weird, crazypianist1116, Jase, and Uncle Pain. yabbaguy and Zdenek I'm less sure of (yabbaguy for overstating the tarsonisocelot case), but also leaning town on."}

Example: Player X seems scummy in the beginning but you know that later they shape up and become more townish, looking back it'd be silly to call them out for what has already been resolved.

That's not why I'm here however. I think in this case it's more likely a scum action than your average bad hammer. This is for two reasons. One, he did exactly what I had accused L of trying to do, which may also have been what put the idea in his head in the first place. Two, I had been shouting about how anti town it would be to end the day and he went and did the opposite thing a townie should have done. That's really the clincher. That above all the other points against him suggests that his actions were scum motivated rather than a bumbling town screw up. <span class=\"noboldsig\">HoS: Cworl</span> That's  a place holder.

I think Jase\u2019s case is justified and I support squeezing out reactions from C-Worl. One thing I found interesting to read:<br><blockquote><div><cite>C-Worl wrote:</cite>If you wish to gain more out of today why don't you target other players that are not me <span class=\"noboldsig\">since the wagon on me apparently isn't going anywhere.</span></div></blockquote>(bold by me)<br>Note that a lot of us could easily put you to L-1.

I'm not saying it to be an ass either. If Jase WERE town then as town I'm giving him the advice of using this time to explore other avenues.

I'm not saying it to be an ass either. If Jase WERE town then as town I'm giving him the advice of using this time to explore other avenues. Squeezing me of information won't work because I don't have any information to give. I'm Vanilla, that's all I know. <br><br>@Redtail896, I don't understand what you want from me. You want me to understand that the hammer was bad for town. I understand it now. However, you also want me to make a proper defense for the hammer-case.

This is the first time you come right out and say it. On that same topic...what does your case against me consist of? Why hold off on making an actual accusation for so long?

Sometimes you do a thing, and it's scummy, and you may even be town. Sometimes when that happens the only thing to say on the matter is \"that happened, and it was scummy\". Still demanding an explanation is pointless, and possibly opportunistic (considering I've been doing what could be interpreted as the same, and doing it quite hard at that). <br><br>The last two bits: How is it that my tunneling is creating a lurky environment? Why am I responsible for keeping everyone in the game active (apparently)? Scummy. Also finals are happening so it's rather pointless to push lurking as a tell right about now.<br><br>I need to go back and look at what you said D1 as well as looking at UP red and me=w more closely.

I find myself guilty of this tunnelling as well.<br><br>As it seems, tarsonisocelot is viewed as a recovering townie by now after her lack of real participation on Day 1. As Me=Weird stated, her <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3044102#p3044102\" class=\"postlink\">#386</a> was indeed a substantial post: she suspects C-Worl and redtail896 the most. While her case on C-Worl is pretty obvious, she doesn\u2019t vote him so that Day 2 is prolonged. This is basically a town move and falls in line with Jase\u2019s behaviour but to be honest it\u2019s also easy for scum to pretend this so I say it\u2019s a null tell.<br><blockquote><div><cite>tarsonisocelot wrote:</cite>Prox-slot: Null due to non-contribution. Slight town-lean because surely at least one of them would have been more interested if the slot was scum.</div></blockquote><br>I don\u2019t really like this one. She ignores the odd behaviour coming from that slot and implies that scum would have been more active \u2192 WIFOM. Well surprise, lurking is actually a good scum move, so I even tend to put the lurking issue on the scummier side. Unfortunately, RangeroftheNorth currently is no better. So I wonder what is so townie about this slot, tarsonisocelot?<br><br><br>The redtail896 case, as far as I see it, revolves around three things:<br><ul><li>the prepared vote switch from C-Worl to tarsonisocelot once it looks more promising (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3028227#p3028227\" class=\"postlink\">#319</a>)</li><li>the over-sensitive reaction to [L]\u2019s question (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3010295#p3010295\" class=\"postlink\">#208</a>)</li><li>the alleged sheeping of popular votes in his first analysis post (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3008124#p3008124\" class=\"postlink\">#188</a>)</li></ul>I already stated my hesitance towards the second point. The first one indeed holds water, I\u2019d like to hear from redtail896 some elaboration about it. I\u2019m not sure about the third one, though; his post comes to me as genuine, especially because he voted tarsonisocelot to investigate her more instead of just going for the most scummy one. As scum, it would\u2019ve been easier to do the latter.<br><br>Any notes from anyone on these cases?"}

Ranger's got a lot to do to make up for the combined impression the previous inhabitants of this slot have made.

Where is the sense in that? bvoigt actually served scum by judging C-Worl as town. WIFOM situation: either bvoigt\u2019s other reads were better and would have made problems for scum (if he had had the chance to pursue them more), or scum wants to make us think just that. Since bvoigt had redtail896 and me as his main suspects, I smell that the latter is the case. This is where Jase\u2019s idea of a link between me and redtail896 could come handy. I myself did a quick skim over both our posts and didn\u2019t find anything really besides my defence part (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3038430#p3038430\" class=\"postlink\">#366</a>).<br><br>Apart from that, I\u2019m at a loss right now. Regarding our past wagons, tarsonisocelot really doesn\u2019t give me as scummy of a read as she used to, and redtail896 has been pretty townie in my eyes all along. imaginality has a valid point with his andrew94 re-read but I\u2019ll have to look into that myself to draw any conclusions. And please let\u2019s not fall for C-Worl\u2019s WIFOM garbage.<br><br>Besides, I\u2019ve been wondering what kind of setup we have. Now that two night passed by without anything special, I conclude there probably is neither a vigilante nor a serial killer in the game. If there\u2019s a doc/jailkeeper, he\u2019s had no luck so far. If there\u2019s a cop/tracker/watcher, I wonder what results he has got so far (if he wasn\u2019t roleblocked, that is). I\u2019m not familiar with games of this size but I tend to believe that the mod will probably not have chosen a mountainous setup; 11 vanilla vs. 2 goons sounds too easy for town to me, 10 vanilla vs. 3 goons sounds too easy for scum to me, so I suspect we have 3 Mafia players and 10 townies with at least one having a power role."}

You'd definitely prefer they come to that conclusion on their own.)

I've played games with you where the scum were the most active players and certainly made every effort to keep others active. You and I both know that there is a whole lot of scum motivation to play that way because a lot of players, especially newer players will auto read them as town for it.

You are both obvscum independently of each other, there just happen to also be a lot of connections and so I pointed those out. There is a small chance I'm wrong about one of you, but it's very small. At the beginning of the game I was suspicious of jase and then me=weird but they both did things throughout the course of the game that made them look townier, whereas you and uncle pain got progressively scummier and more and more likely to be buddies.<br><br>I'll respond to Uncle Pain's post this afternoon."}

However, once I've finished reading the game and am confident in my scum reads, things like this stay in because they're relevant. It's not just one isolated incident.

With the lynch occurring in the meantime, many of the questions as well as the intention itself became obsolete (Day 2 was now practically over). If no one had asked for it, I wouldn\u2019t have posted it because of said obsolescence. But imaginality asked for it and so I posted it nonetheless.

Sorry it's not as convenient as you were hoping. The last game I replaced into the scum team was a bit more obvious than here so it was easier to not doubt my reads. It worked splendidly and we won.

For example, you have no problem with him having a town read on you for activity and not saying much else about you. Scum motivation abounds for you to do this whether Zdenek is scum or town, but a townie would just find it suspect. Also, it's scummy that you asked Zdenek about the alternate wagons he was trying to create while c-worl was at L-1 whether Zdenek is scum or town. If you were a townie, you'd have been suspicious of him ignoring c-worl and trying to distract from the wagon. Scum motivation to draw attention to the other wagons Zdenek was trying to start is obvious. He could've been town scum hunting while ignoring c-worl (very unlikely, but, you know, hypothetical) and you'd still have been scum for trying to move attention away from c-worl to his other suspects.<br><br>All of this from my original case is you scummy independent of Zdenek:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>p125 Uncle Pain defends Andrew. \u201cimaginality: A beautiful case you\u2019ve built here.

Here's a question. In all these games where you've never been lynched, were you scum in any of them? I'm guessing your play as scum was very similar to here, but that it's also similar to your play as town. So since you know people read your scum play as town and you know you should not be considered town just because you're very active, if you are town you should have a problem with players clearing you as town for your activity level. (Wouldn't you agree that scum would target a weaker/less active player before you. A player as active as you is very difficult to get lynched, if just because players, especially newer ones, assume you're town JUST because of playstyle/activity level). If you are scum, I'd expect you to just go with it and be glad you're not being suspected, which is what you're doing."}

I don't mean to argue that activity is a good town-tell, but I do think that activity in the absence of scum-tells is.<br><br>In summary, I think there some oddities in the things that UP has said, the contrast between his reaction to bvoigt's suspicion of him and being relieved that someone is suspicious of him and not originally posting the post of questions he wrote before C-Worl's hammer.

You don\u2019t have to be as verbose, just give pointers and reasons.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>What specifically that I pointed out do you consider \"bad play\"? And what exactly do you mean by bad play?</div></blockquote><br>From my point of view so far, bad play has been:<br><ul><li>minor: random voting without realizing the RVS was already ending/ended</li><li>major: overfocusing on the active players and ignoring the others</li><li>so-so: creating confusion about defending redtail896</li><li>major: not posting my Day 2 questions immediately despite their legitimacy</li></ul>As you can see, by bad play I mean actions or situations that I handled badly.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>I find that if I post all my notes going through the whole game, people I no longer suspect get distracted defending against those things and the scum use those things to distract. I would much rather focus on who I think is scum, which is what I'm doing.</div></blockquote><br>It\u2019s okay to focus, I just wanted to make sure we know what you\u2019re thinking about everyone of us. We need a read on you as well, after all.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>No one else asked Zdenek questions about the other cases he made while c-worl was at L-1 while completely avoiding asking him about c-worl. So, no, you can't compare yourself to the others and say I should also see them as scummy.</div></blockquote><br>I really don\u2019t get your logic. No one asks Zdenek for his read on C-Worl, we\u2019re all guilty for that, yet no one is scummy to you for that. Then I do ask him a few other things (which isn\u2019t scummy by itself) and suddenly I look scummy. I really don\u2019t get it. Read: I do something townish and become scummy to you. I may have failed to see the wide hole (C-Worl) but I still had a good intention in asking him things and we even got useful responses. You call me scummy because of your theory that I tried to distract town but assuming such a thing implies that you had me in mind as scum beforehand. Therefore the distraction theory is based on your assumption that I am scum. You see where this leads? Circular logic. I\u2019m scum to you because you like to think I\u2019m scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>The last game I replaced into the scum team was a bit more obvious than here so it was easier to not doubt my reads. It worked splendidly and we won. Before that though, I found scum and then let myself get talked out of it in 3 games in a row. All 3 led to a loss. So yeah, I'm sticking with the 'not doubting my reads' approach, as it has been proven to work.</div></blockquote><br>1. <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation\" class=\"postlink\">Correlation does not imply causation.</a>  2. <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Statistical_significance\" class=\"postlink\">Statistical significance</a> needs a certain minimum of samples to be sufficiently sure. I highly doubt four games are enough for this. But this is a meta-discussion, let\u2019s postpone this.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>Some of the things related to Zdenek still give you scum points even if he's town.</div></blockquote><br>I\u2019ll do a summary of your points against me in my next post (for the tl;dr people), including my takes on them.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>You are not lynched because you are extremely active and post lots of content and people mistakenly take it for a town tell.</div></blockquote><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Your</span> theory. I have my own: people here actually have another view on my play than you do.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>In all these games where you've never been lynched, were you scum in any of them? I'm guessing your play as scum was very similar to here, but that it's also similar to your play as town. So since you know people read your scum play as town and you know you should not be considered town just because you're very active, if you are town you should have a problem with players clearing you as town for your activity level.</div></blockquote><br>You\u2019re relying on meta gaming, a topic I honestly don\u2019t give a damn about. If someone wants to meta me, they can go ahead, I myself don\u2019t feel any obligation to create any behavioural rules to restrict my town and scum play. For what it\u2019s worth, I have been scum only once and I think my scum play was noticeably different from my town play. Generally I agree with you that activity doesn\u2019t imply townieness; I\u2019ve had my share of experience in this regard already in Newbie 674.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>If you are scum, I'd expect you to just go with it and be glad you're not being suspected, which is what you're doing.</div></blockquote><br>Well, then please give me time to finally take a closer look at Zdenek (despite the anticipation that you will twist the words in my mouth and call it bussing so it fits in your case)."}

And I don\u2019t discriminate if it\u2019s about me or anyone else. I asked bvoigt this to make him state the differences between his view and the opinions of others in order to make both sides rethink their position, keeping discussion up and understanding bvoigt better.

I explained it myself and see no contradiction in it. And I especially see no scumminess in this.</li><li>C-Worl\u2019s WIFOM in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3057905#p3057905\" class=\"postlink\">#437</a> (<span style=\"font-style: italic\">\u201cHammered myself to keep suspicion of Uncle Pain from building up.\"</span>) makes sense.<br>\u2192 You seriously pick up C-Worl\u2019s WIFOM crap? Sounds like you\u2019re desperately looking for clues to incriminate me. Because your case\u2019s small world doesn\u2019t allow me being town.</li><li>I delayed posting my Day 2 questions \u2013 why not post it when I supposedly wrote them? And if I decided not to post it then, why save it for later when the questions would be totally obsolete?<br>\u2192 I wrote the post off when I saw that Day 2 was over. I know now I was wrong with that. I didn\u2019t save it for later on purpose, I just happened to have it still saved in my Mafia Scum notes. Call it stupidity, bad play, whatever, but what exactly is scummy about that?</li><li>I brought up WIFOM thoughts about the bvoigt nightkill in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3069443#p3069443\" class=\"postlink\">#457</a> before anyone else could, hence I clearly nightkilled bvoigt and confuse town by bringing up WIFOM.<br>\u2192 This argument itself is pure WIFOM. Should I have waited with posting this, would that have made another impression? If yes, this would be contradictory to the previous point where I\u2019m criticised for procrastinating my questions. If no, is this an attempt to muzzle me? I think what I think and I speak it out. Also, there is nothing \u201cclear\u201d here.

Hell, I don\u2019t even know how to fish without being hyperobvious. And even if you call me on role fishing, I don\u2019t get what is wrong about fishing for anti-town power roles (if this works at all). Furthermore, I didn\u2019t have to cast suspicion because my suspicion was already there and an anti-town power role fitted in my image of your slot.</li></ul>"}

So, I think either Zdenek = town or Zdenek and UnclePain are the scumteam. I.e. I don't see Zdenek scum and Uncle Pain town as very likely. But, I've had a pretty solid town read on Uncle Pain for most of the game, and his defense has been calmly, clearly argued, so I'm leaning towards them both being town. <br><br>I like Setael's play, too, though.

Jase was pretty fence-sitty about Setael's attack vs Uncle Pain's defense, but I give him high town points for previous days and, despite the stoush at the start of today, I still think he's likely town.<br><br>Yesterday, there really wasn't much effort to put forward an alternative to the C-Worl lynch. To me it seems quite likely the mafia decided N1 to bus him rather than try to rescue him from the fairly blatant quick-hammer. That points towards early bussing rather than late bussing, which to me suggests chkflip/redtail896 as a likely scumbuddy.

Two townies at L-2. Zdenek keeps pushing the L wagon and defending Stefan. Redtail replaces in and votes TO even though he also has a scum read on L. Could go either way on this - I've certainly replaced in as scum and avoided the main wagons, but since both the wagons have flipped town, I can't help but think that scum would've thrown their weight behind one of them at the point that Red replaced in.

If I'm right about the scum team, all 3 of them were on the L wagon here. I don't recall c-worl saying anything about TO really (i'll have to look back again) but it's highly likely everyone on that TO wagon is town. Redtail's the only one I'm not sure about and I'm definitely leaning town on him. So maybe I'm wrong about either UP or Zdenek and one of them is scum with TO. I'll have to think about this.<br><br>I'm ok with imaginality's L-1 vote, though it kind of negates the town points he had for looking elsewhere.

C-worl did the terrible hammer he got lynched over. Other stuff happened but I'm sticking to the stuff I can confidently recall.<br><br>D2- Lot's of shouting at C-worl for most of the day. This is the day most of Sets Zed case comes from. Get's really lurky near the end of the day. I call for a counter wagon, as C-worl was the only one with  a shot at being the lynch. C-worl hammers himself before any of that happens.<br><br>D3- Mostly a lurky mess until Set showed up. TO starts a case against me about the way I go about saying we should ignore c-wifom(?)

Good point about chkflip's response to his criticism of his (lack of) posting. Also, I agree Setael's unvoting in preparation for possibly changing her seems odd. <br><br>584 Pine - I quite like the \"Can anyone tell me why they haven't been lynched?\" line. Not that anyone answered but it seems a useful question to ask for trying to form reads based on people's answers. In my view: Jase didn't get lynched because once he'd explained his reaction-testingy early play, he was very obvtown from then on. tarsonisocelot didn't get lynched because [L] looked pretty scummy. I actually forgot tarsonisocelot was second wagon for the latter part of that day though. Might explain why C-Worl took the chance to quickhammer?<br><br>593 mastin2 - as mentioned, criticising the wagon on Setael without having formed a read on her yet seems suspicious. 595 doesn't really excuse it, since it came across as expressing disapproval (especially since the 'neither' equates it with the wagon on himself, which he can be expected to disapprove of), rather than merely a null read. <br><br>The excessive excusing of his slow re-reading seems.. hm. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@mastin2</span>, can you provide a few links to other games you've replaced into recently? <br><br>598 mastin2 - The tarsonisocelot suspicion seems vaguely expressed, especially \"I'm not sure if it's logic, gut, or a combination thereof which makes me suspicious of her.\"\" Usually easy to tell logic from gut, I'd say. I'm wondering if the \"I suspect TO but not too sure, maybe I'm tunnelling\" is an attempt to get someone else to make a case against her first. <br><br>601 mastin2 - four days to complete your re-read, that close to deadline? I don't like the attitude of \"that should leave enough time to stop mislynches\". I feel like you were hoping to let town get on with mislynching and not have to contribute to the discussion in the meantime, until it was down to one or two wagons. <br><br>At least the deadline's extended now so we should have a decent amount of time to mull over the conclusions of your re-read/VCA. <br><br>607 Setael - Don't like this comment to Uncle Pain: \"Are you seriously trying to make me look suspicious for NOT tunneling?\" You can not tunnel and not unvote, you know... <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>What do YOU think of TO's statement that she finds both you and Zdenek town (him less so but meh) but if Zdenek flipped scum you'd be guaranteed scum? I have a huge problem with it, especially considering she hasn't said what if anything she agrees with as far a connections between you 2. I'm surprised you don't have a problem with it as well IF you're not scum with zdenek.</div></blockquote><br><br>If UP = scum and Zdenek = scum, he'd also have reason to want to cast doubt on the \"If Zdenek flips scum UP is scum\" hypothesis. So him casting doubt on it would be pretty null, which means him not casting doubt on it is also kinda null. <br><br>608 Jase - I still feel like C-Worl seemed so clearly the likely lynch from so early D2 that scum are more likely on that wagon than off it. (For example, no-one backed up Zdenek's \"the hammer wasn't scummy\" suggestion, and even Zdenek offered that too weakly to seem like scum genuinely trying to save scum from a lynch.)<br><br>610 Uncle Pain - I like this question to tarsonisocelot: <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I don\u2019t get this. You\u2019ve seen me as a townie all the time. Now you look for connections and find a good scum team: Setael and Zdenek. It would then be sensible to lynch Zdenek BUT should he flip scum (as you expect) suddenly I am likely scum. WTF?</div></blockquote><br><br>613 Jase (and 618) - I think this is overly harsh on Me=Weird. I read his sentence as 'Setael hasn't changed that [read]' - it's clear from the following sentence he acknowledges she's been more active. <br><br>616 tarsonisocelot - I don't like how she jumped on the Me=Weird wagon here.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Powerrox93 wrote:</cite>Setael (2) - Me=Weird, Pine<br>mastin2 (2) - Zdenek, imaginality<br>Me=Weird (2) - Jase, tarsonisocelot<br>tarsonisocelot (1) - mastin2<br>Zdenek (1) - Setael<br><br>Not voting (1) - Uncle Pain<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Not liking the spread here, we could do with starting to consolidate this. <br><br>The last few pages make me feel better about Me=Weird, worse about Setael, mastin2, and tarsonisocelot. I'll stick with my mastin2 vote for now, but I'm happy to support a tarsonisocelot wagon also. Those two are definitely my preferred lynch choices for today. I could potentially be convinced to vote Setael, Pine or Me=Weird (in order of preference) but it would take a better case than I've seen so far. Not interested in Zdenek (mainly because I don't think his defending C-Worl is that strong of a point, and his town read on Uncle Pain early today looked much more likely from town than scum), Uncle Pain or Jase (both those two, especially Jase, have looked very town to me for most of the game)."}

Right here in this sentence that I quoted right above In the post you just responded to, and in this earlier post. Not, \"I don't like/agree with her contribution' but \"No contribution\"  is clearly what you said.<br><br>Yeah, you say that the slot previously did not contribute, and had suspicious interaction with c-worl. You then say \"and setael hasn't changed that.\" The first part is clearly wrong and the second part doesn't make sense.</div></blockquote><br>If by first part you mean that other slot members didn't contribute, that's totally true, if by first part you mean that whole sentence, then not only is the first part of that sentence true, but I do consider the lack of interactions <span style=\"font-style: italic\">from</span> c-worl scummy. By second part, I assume you mean \"and setael didn't change that\", I did not mean that setael hasn't changed the no contributions, which is what I think you think I mean, but that setael hasn't changed my scumread of here.<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I also don't like the attempt to discredit my case. As it is just as wrong as the thing I first called you out for. Not only that but you're backpedaling.

More on this later.<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Also, could you explain the bit about \"She could be bussing\" ? <br>I'm not sure how that relates to what I said.</div></blockquote><br>That was about how part of her case could be genuine, but bussing. Assuming of course that I'm right.<br><br>Recap: Your case is that I said setael hasn't contributed, which is a lie, that now I'm saying I never said that, and I think something about how interactions with c-worl is wrong.<br><br>What's true: I never said setael hasn't contributed. When I said \"setael hasn't changed that\", I'm talking about setael not changed my scum-read, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">not</span> setael hasn't changed the no contributing. So it's true that I never said that, although looking back, I can sort of see how you could think that because of poor sentence structure. Next, about c-worl interactions, what I'm saying is this: I find it scummy how C-worl failed to interact with setaels slot.<br><br><br>Uncle pain: I meant that if deadline came up, I'd be willing to switch to cp to avoid a no-lynch, which I'd still do but now find it unlikely that that's going to be necessary. Also, that was before the deadline extension, when deadliine was drawing near with no leading wagon. Now that pine's here, I guess my read is slightly leaning town.<br>Again, I when I wrote \"setael hasn't changed that\", I was solely talking about her not changing my read."}

Coming into the game and building a case an two of my town reads seems more likely to come from town, though it is still possible that she's scum. As for CP/Pine...well pine is catching up so I'm waiting on him to get in the game to pass judgement. As for the case against CP it seems mostly based on lurking yeah? And while lurking is good for scum I find that town are more or less equally likely to lurk, and since he ended up being replaced I'm not comfortable saying that it was intentional scumlurking. Somebody needs to shout at lurkers so they get in the game, but that was already happening so I just let it go.<br><br>Imaginality: I (at least somewhat) like your points against mastin. Especially the point about his 598. I also agree with your point about Sets 607. About my 608 I disagree. While scum was very likely to be on the wagon it wouldn't be unheard of for at least one to be off, and as for Zdeneks defense of C-worl a strong defense would have been suicide should c-worl have been lynched. Zeds defense of him reads as scum doing what he can for his buddy by nudging town in another direction. As for your point about my 613 I could see it being poor wording for the part about interaction with c-worl, but the part about Sets non contribution was said twice in more or less the exact same way. That makes it hard to believe that it was just poor wording or miscommunication. The way he defends himself is suspicious as well saying \"I say those things (when he did) and your case is stupid and wrong\". He shouted about how I am a wrong lying liar instead of going on about how I misinterpreted a poorly worded suspicion. That is what makes his defense scummy (because again the wording of his posts on Set are pretty clear, he did say those things)."}

It only covers up to TWBBS, since after that, I switched to mastin2 (Ask Pine) and have neglected to put my new games on there.<br><br><br>Alternatively, just look at every single Large Game which is running right now.

I was 'suspicious' of him, but couldn't do it. I knew that if it was just me, I wouldn't be able to pull off a win by myself.<br>1048 contains the prototype to my Guide on Cop Play.<br><br>I'm most concise when I lock on immediately and don't get emotional. If I don't get solid reads, I wall. If I get emotional, I wall. If I have neither, I tend not to. The newbie game with DarthYoshi is an example of this--I had maybe two or three long walls, the rest of my posts quite short.<br><br><br>My style briefly: since I'm fresh from retirement, I haven't settled down INTO a style, so my play changes with every game. It's honed with off-site experience combined with wisdom of my time away and time spent reading MD along with refining my methods of scumhunting, so my play is slowly improving every game. <br>There's certainly some things remaining the same throughout all my games, but a lot of what \"Mastin2\" is hasn't been defined, yet, because I'm still trying to work that out, myself. <br><br>General trends--Scum: Start out calm, cool, and logical, generally seen as town. I put myself into my town meta, and it works beautifully. (However, I often am trapped--boxed in--by it, locking into an action which I feel I cannot back out of as scum more often than I do as town.) Initially. Then I freak out. The facade cracks; my mask disappears when emotions start to pour in--for instance, insulting me certain ways makes me sensitive as scum, whereas when I'm town, it doesn't bother me. (I dunno why.) <br><br>Town: Impulsive, with certain compulsions. I follow feelings far more than I follow my head, doing whatever I think I should in order to win. I take a lot of risks that aren't exactly optimal play. While I do gambit as scum, I much prefer gambitting as town. I'm prone to overconfidence (related to confirmation bias tendencies and reverse-confirmation-bias), and I am slow to accept being wrong. That's pretty much as much as I know about my town meta. <br><br>Third party: Only once. The Large \"Normal\" run by Jebus, with Llamafluff as the backup mod. I was a Lyncher, outed Day One by a JOAT who Rolecopped me.<br>I truthfully told the town everything--my true target, what I was planning on doing, how I was planning on winning, everything. And proceeded to try and legitimately scumhunt...but people didn't believe me. We fought for 30 pages. I got distracted, emotional, stopped scumhunting and worked on defense. It didn't work; I got lynched Day One. When the game ended, I grumbled an \"I told you so!\" about my play having town's interests in mind.<br>Summary: I try to play identical to town, but when attacked, I react exactly as scum, the alignment acting as a bridge between the two sides, ironically.<br><br>Other: I'm fond of meta. Both for myself, and others when I have the time. I know, bad habit. 'Been trying to get rid of it in my play, but it keeps coming back. 'Working theory: I am a sentimental guy who ponders the past, seeing what he's done well and what he's...'not done well'. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br><br>I'm better at reading other's meta (when I research it enough) than mine. I Wall, always have, and--despite efforts to get rid of them--likely always will. It used to be that if I didn't wall, I was lethargic or dangerously close. AKA, lazily lurked around somehow managing to be more anti-town than walling. (As both alignments.) Either way, greatly anti-town, and have tried to stop that from being me again. I was a VI, who has become more wise (though not good &gt;_&lt;) with experience. <br>(Also, I evolved over time to become someone who tends to get strong reads, though it became tunneling often.)<br><br><br>I'm also quite fond of MD, if you haven't noticed. Love theory a lot, but suck at putting theory into practice, especially as a player.<br><br><br>Overall Summary: I'm a messed-up guy. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br><br>The person in this game most likely a Mastin Expert would be Pine--ask him and he'll challenge anything in here he sees as wrong.</div></div></div>There. that should answer any meta-questions.

You never say he's scum you just quietly ignore him and push other people.

I wish I could put my finger on one thing that exemplifies WHY I find him suspicious, but it's dozens of little things scattered throughout his posts. Trying too hard while not accomplishing much of anything sums it up pretty well, actually.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Uncle Pain</span>: Despite a rocky start, seems to be genuinely scumhunting. Reaction hunting, then analysis. Post 71 is a good example, as is 91. Plays a bit reckless, even sloppy. I expect that from Town. Compare to the too-clean imaginality.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">TarsonisOcelot</span>: Soft-cleared as above. Plays recklessly, but with purpose.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Me=Weird</span>: Tunneling, hard to read...inconclusive at this point.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Zdenek</span>: Buddies to Jase a bit too hard for being scum with Jase to be likely. Gut scum read...can't really explain why.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">imaginality</span>: Considering Andrew's page 1 SK hunting, imaginality's following post can be read as a subtle hint to stop SK hunting and redirection into a different way to mislynch her. Otherwise, I have a fairly good Town read on him...which is in itself highly suspicious. I'm a paranoid player, and when I get a strong Town-read, it's almost always wrong. Town don't play that cleanly, but good scum do. Potential scumbuddy of Jase's. Look at 96...as soon as a chance to clear Jase comes up, he supports it, after which suspicion of Jase dies.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Setael's predecessors</span>: I have a thoroughly null read on all predecessors and their total of 15 posts. When I get to where Setael replaces in, I'll start her with a clean slate.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mastin's predecessors</span>: Surprise Carcinogen's opening is very reminiscent of my previous experience with her. We thought she was scum then and unanimous-lynched her D1, she flipped Town. I'm inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt for now and get a better read once things settle in.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Conclusions</span>: Having narrowed it down to 7 players and (probably) two scum remaining, I feel good about our odds. Jase needs to hang first, and my next choice is between Zdenek and imaginality, depending on flip. I'm pretty sure about 1-2 scum in that group (at this point)."}

Actively pursues clues, questions people, calls out lurkers. He may push a bit too far sometimes but I see genuine aggressive town intent behind it. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Town.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-style: italic\">tarsonisocelot</span>: ambivalent feeling about her. Her level of activity/contribution/commitment reads like a bell curve to me: first her bad start, then the recovery phase where she posted a lot, now decreasing again. I dislike her vote hopping from this Day, she seems unmotivated to build a real case to back up the votes. I also remember her IioA approach from Day 1 which looks like coming from either a lazy townie or from a calculating scum. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Null-scum.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Me=Weird</span>: a bit lurky in my eyes, my impression is that he isn\u2019t good at making cases and thus likes to sheep others\u2019. I fail to see real scum intent behind that though, his posts suggest he\u2019s looking at many options at a time (not only the obvious wagons) and tries to get reads on people to have some confidence in his votes. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Null-town.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Zdenek</span>: Setael\u2019s case revealed some interesting oddities in his play which he couldn\u2019t clean himself from. Apart from that, his play has been contributive in a pro-town way and he hasn\u2019t made any major slips. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Null-town.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-style: italic\">imaginality</span>: seems to care about the game, his analyses and cases have been a good thing for town and his conclusions are generally reasonable. At some points I had this \u201ctoo townie to be townie\u201d feeling about him but it\u2019s WIFOM and I can\u2019t back it up. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Town.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Setael (RangeroftheNorth, Prox, Mist7676, GroupThink)</span>: the little amount and the kind of contribution from the four predecessors keep ringing in my head. Setael on the other hand made up for this with her walls; her former security in her case against Zdenek and me looked like scum pushing hard for mislynches but her current diffidence feels more like a townie rethinking the situation instead of scum looking for easier cases. I find it hard to judge this slot due to the massive difference in play style between Setael and the other four. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Null-scum.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-style: italic\">mastin2 (chkflip, redtail896, Surprise_Carcinogen)</span>: Surprise_Carcinogen never struck me as anti-town, redtail896 didn\u2019t do much to disturb that feeling although there were some interesting points that could be seen as slips. But mastin2 doesn\u2019t really convince me so far, his posts scream active lurking and voting before having read the thread is way off the pro-town route. This even supersedes the townish read on his predecessors. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Scum.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Pine (crazypianist1116)</span>: I never got to know why crazypianist1116 decreased his scum hunting on Day 2; I could theorize about this all day but my conclusion is that he\u2019s been rather pro-town. Pine on the other hand doesn\u2019t fit in this picture, first he tries to get around contributing, then he reads the first five pages and casts his vote. If this isn\u2019t dubious, I don\u2019t know what. In fact, a very similar case to mastin2. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Scum.</span></li></ul>In consequence and regarding the current wagons: <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: mastin2</span>.

And would the predecessors, whatever their activity, really have failed to submit an action N2 and chosen not to protect N1? That seems more like a convenient claim to avoid getting caught out by any watcher or tracker results. <br><br>On the other hand, it seems kind of bold to fake-claim and claim no-action for both nights.

I have to gather my thoughts\u2026<br><br>First of all, thank you all for this game. I taught me a lot in ways I didn\u2019t think about.<br><br>I was in fact very surprised to see that Zdenek really was scum \u2013 his play was a bit lurkish but he never managed to rub me the wrong way really. I\u2019m sorry I gave town the wrong impression that I could be a scumbuddy. I hope I\u2019ll get better at this. At least I managed to not get targeted by scum; although my deputy role was only a backup role, I felt that it could get important.<br><br><strike>What I still don\u2019t get is how scum knew so sure that crazypianist1116/Pine was the cop. Was it luck? If he did breadcrumb on Day 1, I fail(ed) to see it.</strike> Having read the scum QuickTopic, it looks like pure luck that crazypianist1116 was chosen as the one to be blocked \u2013 and also Night 2! I wonder though what I did to be the second in line for this choice on Night 1 (QuickTopic #13) and why I was an \u201cultra-obvious target for a doc protect\u201d during Night 1. Most had a good town read on me but is this alone enough to warrant a doc protection?<br>Nevertheless, the two roleblocks on crazypianist1116 were a major drawback for town; had we not lynched Zdenek on Day 3 (thank goodness mastin2 managed to convince you of his claim), Day 4 wouldn\u2019t have happened like it did. When I read the night choices, my first thought was why the hell scum didn\u2019t kill the cop Night 1/2 but then I realized that by doing so they downgrade the cop to vanilla while killing others, which effectively means doing a better job while avoiding the risk of a possible deputy to take over (who in turn would have to be identified by scum first).<br>So, good play scum team, you tricked me well the whole time.<br><br>On the other hand, I think that I myself don\u2019t deserve the win. I tried to look for clues but I didn\u2019t bring up much, especially compared to Setael\u2019s elaborate case or Jase\u2019s active hunting, and in fact I even managed to incriminate myself by saying stupid things that triggered scum reads for some of you. Especially Setael\u2019s case against me was something I wasn\u2019t sure I could defend against because yes, my play had flaws that she pulled to the surface with brilliant accuracy. What do I learn from this? I don\u2019t know, I think I\u2019m already quite careful about what I say but it seems it\u2019s not sufficient.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Powerrox93 wrote:</cite>Anyway, this set-up looks a bit swingy with the deputy.

In this game the cop didn't get back any results the first two nights and the bodyguard didn't do anything during the first two nights.</div></blockquote><br>I think town won because of strong town players, regardless of power roles. The setup looks fairly intuitive; as I said earlier in the game, 10 town vs. 3 scum looks balanced as long as town has power roles. In comparison to \u201ctraditional\u201d setups (like F11 or Trendy and Subversive), you decided to trade town\u2019s investigative power for protective power by putting in a bodyguard instead of a doctor (decreasing town\u2019s protection) and by having a deputy (increasing town\u2019s investigation) \u2013 I think it\u2019s a fair trade and you should try the setup several times to see if there\u2019s a tendency towards town or scum. As a game setup noob, I think it\u2019s a good setup.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Powerrox93</span>: Thank you a lot for modding this game!

A doc with no PR reads would probably protect one of the most useful players, so that's one reason why it made more sense for us to take out DemonHybrid, who'd only just joined but who already looked likely to us to become a big threat if we let him live.
