Again no content. Probably bussing Jase.<br>\nThird post, no useful content. Trying to deflect onto lurkers. Yabba was actual being useful with his original post unlike somebody I know.</div></blockquote>\nMy first post was an RVS vote. I felt at that time that the discussion hasn&#8217;t become too serious. As I mentioned above, I stand rather neutral about yabbaguy&#8217;s attempt to create discussion (and yes yabbaguy, I do see the townie aspect in there, I&#8217;m just not sure if it&#8217;s the best way to start Day 1) and please don&#8217;t get me started about the rather ridiculous &#8220;case&#8221; against tarsonisocelot because of her welcome post. Hence my reluctance to step into these two discussion threads; my initial intent was to watch and get the whole picture. By the way, my RVS choice was made by skimming the nickname list and picking a name that struck me in any way and well, &#8220;Me=Weird&#8221; just did that. I didn&#8217;t know back then that she was V/LA (the mod only wrote this in #27), otherwise I surely would have picked another player for RVS voting.<br>\n<br>\nMy second post (third post actually) was meant to be provocative (hooray it worked), yet has actually three reasons behind it:\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li>His first post starts a small case against yabbaguy and then he turns around and votes StefanB. I honestly fail to see the logic behind that, calling someone scummy and yet voting someone else <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">without giving any reason whatsoever</div>. RVS was definitely over at that point so either he failed to see this or he wanted to provoke and/or attract attention.<br>\n</li><li>In his second post he just bows down to imaginality&#8217;s and [L]&#8217;s reactions and votes who <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">they</div> are suspecting, with some sarcasm being the icing. Now I may not be a big fan of sarcasm in Mafia Scum, hence my &#8220;don&#8217;t like the attitude&#8221;. But my real problem with this post is that he looks opportunistic, already early in the game. Opportunism is always scummy.<br>\n</li><li>In this fourth post he accuses me of not participating much (a fact I accept) and implies that I should be watched more. And indeed some OMGUS moment arose in me then (if you prefer to call it &#8220;touchy&#8221;, go ahead), I mean, this guy has hit my scumdar twice in three posts and then he accuses <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">me</div> of being anti-town by not participating? This was the last straw so I voted him.</li></ol>\n\nI disagree with my third post being useless. I confronted yabbaguy with my point of view on his honey pot in order to clarify my stand on him. I think you went a bit too far by implying that stating my opinion and expecting a reaction is not useful. Regarding the lurkers part, I wanted to rectify Surprise_Carcinogen&#8217;s misconception. I mean, he stated it, I checked it and found it false &#8211; why should I not call him out on this?<br>\n<br>\nSo crazypianist1116, please elaborate what about my statements you actually found scummy.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Jase wrote:</cite>Obvious omgus and vote hopping on top of it all, godamn, this is almost too easy.<br>\n<br>\nSeriously though...do you actually have a reason for voting me or am I just getting on your nerves?</div></blockquote>\nFirst, for the voting reasons, see above; this should take care of your OMGUS argument. Second, up until now, I fail to see myself vote hopping, especially compared to you. While I have RVS-voted Me=Weird and then switched to you for the reasons above, you have switched your vote from StefanB (which you, by the way, never gave a reason for) to yabbaguy (which you, by the way, never gave a reason for) to me (which you finally did give a reason for); this should take care of your vote hopping argument. Now what was your case against me again?<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>yabbaguy wrote:</cite>Uncle Pain, this is extraordinary now. You have to at least realize that there us Town intent in that post. Don't call the post itself anything but that, or you've sorely missed the point.</div></blockquote>\nYes I realize this. But as I said, I argue that it&#8217;s not the best way to start Day 1 in a pro-town way. It just looks forced and you inflict a small stain on your clean slate. I don&#8217;t say it&#8217;s scummy. I just say it&#8217;s unusual to me.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>GroupThink wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Uncle Pain</span></div></blockquote>\nCome on, what is that supposed to mean? We&#8217;re on page 3 and in the middle of a discussion, you can&#8217;t just hop on the bandwagon and not tell us why.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>StefanB wrote:</cite>Uncle Pain: Why don't you want an avatar?</div></blockquote>\nIt&#8217;s a personal matter, nothing rational&#8230; it feels kind of neutral and unbiased when I encounter players without avatars.

I'm not telling you \"listen to everything I say.\" I'm saying if I say something, you disagree, and give me a good reason, and I say \"Huh, good point.\" the \"huh, good point\" isn't sarcasm.

I'd almost accept someone not posting anything up until now because they're busy(easter and all) but to cast a vote without saying SOMETHING is suspect at best. I'm also not liking Andrew too much, but I'm hesitant to say anything concrete just yet as most of it is based on what I suspect to be his play style, as it seems the things I dislike about him are true across all of his plays.

Just to be clear, I have not examined his play in other games at all.

Can you point out where you found andrew94 particularly scummy?

Partly that's an overall impression, a matter of his tone, but some of the contributing factors are:<br>\n<br>\n(i) his over-focus on the 'active lurking'* point against him, which shifted the focus onto him originally, compared with addressing the scummy aspects of his more recent posts;<br>\n(ii) appealing to emotion and having a 'defeated' air when he's only at L-4 (the weak townies I've seen 'give up' have tended to do it when they're closer to being lynched than this, though I don't have objective stats on this - that's just been my experience) <br>\n(iii) the way in which his refusal to argue against the 'genuine' people on his wagon seems like admitting that there are good reasons to want him lynched, and his concern is just to show us why we're wrong about the active lurking thing<br>\n(iv) seeing Me=Weird's pressure as not genuine and being less concerned about andrew94's doesn't make much sense from a townie (in my opinion), but does from this 'scum caught for the wrong reason' angle, since Me=Weird is the person who's pushed the 'active lurking' point<br>\n<br>\n* I'm using this as shorthand; I know the actual point is not simply active lurking. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nOn andrew94, I wasn't all that impressed by his earlier posts (asking questions but not appearing to properly scumhunt, or move his vote to a non-random target), but this post was what stood out to me:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>andrew94 114 wrote:</cite>about stefanb: i dont know about yabba's reaction testing, but i got the sense that he was joking about dont lynch me, then made up the 'reaction test' part after as he went along. because he had a huge 'best ic' tag underneath him, it seems impossible that you can miss that. therefore, stenfanb is scum, because town wouldnt do 'stefan's first post' to an experienced player. HE later states that he did indeed see the best ic sign, and was trying to do a reaction test. this is absolute Bs and i get the feeling that he just wanted to seem like he is doing something<br>\ntherefore unvote vote stefanb </div></blockquote>\n\nThere were plenty of good reasons to join the StefanB wagon, but this feels so stretched. 'Town won't ask a player with an award a rhetorical question about a scummy opening post to see what the other player says in response.' I really, really don't think that's a sound claim. This seems like andrew94 reading \"how to be scum 101\" and thinking, \"hmm, if I'm going to get on the wagon and not look opportunistic, I have to come up with an independent reason rather than sheep what the others said.\" <br>\n<br>\nI don't think StefanB is any more or less likely to be town if andrew94 flips scum, since andrew94 could be opportunistically joining the wagon either to try to get a mislynch if StefanB is town or to earn townpoints for bussing if StefanB is scum. But if StefanB flips scum, iStefanB's reluctance to challenge andrew94 compared with Me=Weird points slightly towards andrew94 also being scum (with StefanB not wanting to simply shift the pressure from him onto his scumbuddy, but rather onto a townie).  <br>\n<br>\nGoing to comment on others in my next post - I don't want to spend all my time on StefanB.

As for the bit about sheeping, I accept your explanation.<br>\n<br>\nSecond bit: I looked back and I saw it, that is a thing that happens. You say you didn't vote me because you voted Uncle Pain, but why would you vote him for something that could have been scum motivated when what you accused me of MUST have been scum motivated? It makes no sense for you not to vote me if you truly believe what you said. I'm calling BS on that. Moving right along, yes I saw your reasoning for accusing SC. Problem is you throw down some support for my wagon and then in the same breath you make an accusation for being on the wagon that you JUST supported. In general it seems like you don't want to be ON my wagon but you still want my wagon to succeed. You then use being on my wagon as points against two other players so you can call them out if my wagon DOES succeed, and YOU get to say \"I told you there was something wrong with that wagon\".

I'm going to give my summary person by person here.  I'm sorry for the length; I'm not normally this long-winded, but I feel the need to make up for lost time.<br>\n<br>\n[L]: One of the primary wagons here.  I can't possibly see why she found no logical reasons for the Jase wagon, and that seems very much to be an excuse after-the-fact; why wasn't she saying that to begin with?  Comes up with an awful reason for her unvote (which was kind of out of the blue and w/o explanation anyway), and admits that she's not following her usual town meta.  She doesn't really seem to do much actually (by her own admission).  Overall, I feel like I just don't have enough information here to make an informed decision.  I'll look at the anti-L cases in a bit more depth, but there might be bigger fish to fry.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Verdict: Slightly Leaning Mafia</div><br>\n<br>\nandrew94: I just don't see what andrew has accomplished.  He has what has already been noticed as the worst reasoning for voting Stefan, and beyond that is very centered on Jase for unclear reasons (or reasons that we've long since moved beyond).  I see no real scumhunting here, and indeed little effort to give the appearance of scumhunting.  Oh, and he's failed to respond to any of the comments about his Stefan vote.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Verdict: Leaning Mafia</div><br>\n<br>\ncrazypianist1116: Few posts, but I actually like what I see.  Is willing to reconsider votes and suspicions, harps on andrew and stefan, is logical and willing to leap into a fray.  I'd like to see more activity, but for now, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Verdict: Leaning Town</div><br>\n<br>\nimaginality: Tends to stay with the safe wagons, but his reasoning is generally good.  Nice tunnelling of Stefan, and helped to make a strong case.  I want to see the promised examination of others. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Verdict: Leaning Town</div><br>\n<br>\nJase: Wow.  Starts off so insanely scummy that I'm surprised a larger wagon never formed, and then turned around and became a fantastic player.  Of his early play I'll say little, but there's quite a bit to glean from later stuff.  There's a lot I could say, but as a form of summary I'll note that <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3005356#p3005356\" class=\"postlink\">Post 168</a> was the moment I decided that he was closer to the town column. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Verdict: Leaning Town</div><br>\n<br>\nMe=Weird: First to identify what he classifies as a Stefan scumslip, and tends (self-admittedly) to tunnel.  I want his opinion of other people (he's really tunnelling), but I just don't find anything offensive here.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Verdict: Slightly Leaning Town</div><br>\n<br>\nMist7676: For starters, I completely disagree with her opinions on selfvoting; Stefan: you shouldn't selfvote.  Beyond that, Mist is tunnelling Stefan, and barely contributing to that.  Actually, I'm not clear on why you're voting for Stefan.  My assumption is that you reposting imagin's case is an agreement, but you haven't really done any scumhunting yourself.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Verdict: Null</div><br>\n<br>\nStefanB: Here we go.  Weird unvote in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2991036#p2991036\" class=\"postlink\">Post #70</a>.  The real nail in the coffin for me is this post (#107):<blockquote><div><cite>StefanB wrote:</cite>Other strange thinks: Post 4 (first playerpost) were did the candyjoke come from? This sounds strange, wouldn't be a day later, but on Saturday it sounded strange.<br>\nBTW: The treads needs more Crazypianist und Zdenek(3 posts each) and of corse more GroupThink (a vote).<br>\nUncle Pain: Sorry forgot to answer your question.<br>\n<br>\nI did calm my anger. First I voted yabba to get a reaction, didn't like the reaction, so vote stayed.<br>\nI still think his gambit was a bad idea, and will be watching him. I would call him a slight townread, at the moment. Would like to watch him, when he isn't arguing with me, unfortunatly hasn't posted since nearly 2 days.</div></blockquote><br>\nThat description of his yabba vote sounds like revisionist history at best.  Also, he's very much sitting on the fence here on the yabba issue, and I don't like that.  He also misunderstands/represents the rhetorical question issue.  I'm sympathetic to the \"frustrated townie\" view here, but overall my <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Verdict:Leaning Mafia</div><br>\n<br>\ntarsonisocelot: How has only yabbaguy jumped on TO?  There is almost no content here.  Just go read the ISO.  Look at how much of TO's writing is fluff, unrelated, or small, unsubstantiated statements.  All of her strongest statements are things that everybody will agree with anyway.  Still has a vote on L, but I'm not sure I could tell you why.  I encourage everybody to read this ISO (it won't take long).  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Verdict: Leaning Mafia</div><br>\n<br>\nUncle Pain: Another poster that started weak (possibly to get a reaction), but clearly got better.  I like a lot of his reasoning, particularly this:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Uncle Pain wrote:</cite><br>\nAw come on, what is this? First yabbaguy, then Jase, now [L]: you do a scummy mistake and later say &#8220;it was all planned to fish for reactions&#8221;. I&#8217;m sorry guys but this is just a tad too convenient. As much as I see that creating discussion is a valid townie move, I find baiting someone (or anyone) rather scummy because we townies don&#8217;t need to pull such tricks to find scum, plus it confuses town. The problem I see for myself here is that I don&#8217;t know how to evaluate this in terms of suspicion. I gotta admit that [L]&#8217;s trick looks the strangest. Not only because it looks the least planned and most retroactively justified of the three but also since she tried to particularly goad Surprise_Carcinogen. [L], do you have an actual case against him? As far as I see it, you dislike his statements about mafia theory and that&#8217;s it&#8230;</div></blockquote><br>\nQFT.  Really.  The number of \"act scummy then say later that I was looking for reactions\" plays is absurd.  Everybody needs to stop using that defense (you'll notice I consider it one of the big strikes against Stefan above).  Overall: good reasoning and solid hunting.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Verdict: Leaning Town</div><br>\n<br>\nyabbaguy: The original fake idiocy play, which went off rather well (in his eyes).  I don't really like your player by player list in #151 though.  I don't really see refutations of anti-Stefan cases, nor reasons that imagin is scum (it's not obvious to me that his case is \"a bunch of nonsense\")  Other scum votes are very tentative.  Jumps on TO, so it's unlikely that they are both scum (that would be a rather extreme bus).  I'm unsure here; would be interested to hear others' thoughts.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Verdict: Null</div><br>\n<br>\nZdenek: I'd like to see more, but what I've seen has been good.  Nice arguments concerning L (including what I think to be one of the best summaries of the case).  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Verdict: Leaning Town</div><br>\n<br>\nWhew, sorry that was so long.<br>\n<br>\nTLDR: My scumreads are TO, Stefan, andrew, and [L]<br>\n<br>\nNow, if we're going to stick with either Stefan or [L], I'll have more to say on that matter.  However, I feel that a certain person has been sorely underinvestigated.

Hopefully I'll be able to give a more detailed post tomorrow. I do want to respond to this though.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>[L] wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>crazypianist1116 wrote:</cite>[L], I'm voting for you. If you want, you can refute my case. Regardless I want more votes for you.</div></blockquote>Well, frankly, you've seen me play as scum. I am much....shall we say....different. My town approach is to analyze more... but this game started out so disgustingly that I haven't even done that. I'll be honest - I haven't been involved in the game the way I wanted to be. I'm frustrated. But I'm not giving up on the game because I'm the type to see things through to their end.</div></blockquote><br>\nYes, I've seen you play as scum. That does not mean your scum play is completely unique. You could be intentionally playing differently than you were in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=16948&amp;start=0\" class=\"postlink\">Newbie #1082</a> purely in an attempt to throw me off. Or you could just be playing differently as a result of real life. What I'm trying to say here is that your playing differently does not exempt you from being scum.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>[L] wrote:</cite>Your case against me is somewhat laughable because it is untrue. Let me point out the ways:<blockquote><div><cite>crazypianist1116 wrote:</cite>VOTE: [L]<br>\n    She's been doing a ton of talking without throwing around suspicion at all. This is particularly scummy behavior. The vote was useless essentially the entire game as it hasn't really been accompanied by much pressure and the unvote came out of nowhere. Also on my scumlist (in no particular order) are Jase, andrew94, Surprise_Carcinogen, and StefanB.</div></blockquote><br>\n\"ton of talking\": This is laughable because I have 15 posts; two of which had content, and the rest only consisted of votes or up to 3 lines max. That's not a ton of talking by anyone's standards. Personally, I'd lynch people for doing as little talking as me.</div></blockquote><br>\nOk perhaps we were mixing up our definitions. By accusing you of doing a \"ton of talking,\" I was accusing you of that which you just described. You were active in the game, but not doing much to help push the game forward.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>[L] wrote:</cite>\"throwing around suspicion\": When one throws around suspicion, they are scum. Townies cast suspicion on those they suspect, not randomly.</div></blockquote><br>\nOh boy confusing definitions again. By throwing around suspicion, I did mean actually casting suspicion on people. You however were not doing that. It seemed like you were waiting for a prime target to appear so you could go in and make your case.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>[L] wrote:</cite>\"vote was useless\": My vote on TO was not useless, because it was not a pressure vote. I truly believe she is scum. Currently, I had to remove my vote to see how she behaves. I'm somewhat ambivalent right now, on her.</div></blockquote><br>\nYour vote was useless because it didn't do anything for the game. You never made a decent case yet you held that vote there for roughly four pages. You never tried to push for TO's lynch, which is scummy behavior considering you were voting her for so long.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>[L] wrote:</cite>\"unvote came out of nowhere\": Yes, it would seem so. But I unvoted her in order to regroup my thoughts and see how she behaves. And saying that this is what I am doing is inconsequential even if she reads it.</div></blockquote><br>\nI really don't see the reasoning for this. If you've explained it in the past few pages, my apologies.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nStefanB, next time can you please try to not post 9 times in a row.

If you need any help with German-English translations, feel free to ask, I&#8217;m German as well.<br>\n<br>\nYou wholeheartedly admit to playing badly (posting fluff, temper-dependent, naivety,&#8230;). Well, I&#8217;d suggest you try to improve this bit. It&#8217;s not always easy to distinguish bad play from scummy play so don&#8217;t be surprised that you have a wagon on you.

While this was certainly true, I do see your point as well. Still, envy is a bad reason to vote someone. In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2993601#p2993601\" class=\"postlink\">#103</a> Me=Weird gave his voting reason which basically boils down to your unvote that looked out of place and inconsequential, plus he refers to imaginality&#8217;s <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2993337#p2993337\" class=\"postlink\">#96</a> which includes criticism on your unvote.

She has been confusingly non-defensive since, taking a lynch quite easy. Anti-town behaviour is anti-town. Since I assume some higher level of expertise here compared to the newbie games I&#8217;ve had so far, I consider anti-town scum more likely than anti-town town, hence I find her scummy.

Why did that change?</div></blockquote><br>\nAbout to reread the next few pages. Got interrupted by falling asleep at my desk.<br>\nAt endof page 3, my vote on [L] was still there from RVS because they hadn't done anything particularly townie. They had five posts of which one corrected the bracketing of their random vote and another contained only an emoticon, of the two with any attempt at content one pointed out that Jase's late RV was weird and the other sheeped Imaginality &amp; andrews reason for voting me. I did not feel the need to change my vote yet as I hadn't seen anyone I was sure deserved it more than [L] or gotten some kind of supertownie vibe from them, current suspicions of them will appear further through the reread. Jase was being suspicious, as stated in my readthrough, but there were others already trying to get more out of him and I wasn't yet sure whether they were just being scummily weird or being actually scummy. My hope was that other better players would get more from them before I chose to change votes or not, which did happen. SC was mainly on the list because of their lurkiness plus being overly defensive about being accused of lurkiness. It wasn't a strong read, but this was page 3.<br>\n<br>\nI thought that imaginality initially responded badly to the reactionfish, but the second post was less so. The Jase vote was justified at the time for the \"call out scum, then vote a random instead\" weirdness. There wasn't much content from them, but they did attempt to give reasons for their votes. Mostly here it was that others, particularly Jase, had done more suspicious things so I'd stopped thinking much about imaginality. I won't be evaluating every player at every point, but I will attempt to do so for the end of the reread because the main thing I might overlook is non-active lurking. <br>\n<br>\nThis read through will focus mostly on listing the things I think possibly notable, along with some small amount of comments on why. The mentions of tangents are there so people like Jase know that I am not ignoring those posts, but deliberately disregarding them as irrelevant. I do not feel I am good enough at distinguishing useful information from useless, so I'm erring on the side of more information. Later, when I have a full reread done I'll try to refine my reads more.

And 202's \"Well what exactly would the votes on Jase help town, he would have four not three. What does a vote on someone who will quit the game probably help\" is a poor point, as well as the way he misrepresents my case against him as being mainly about scumpartners. (\"But because nobody has said this to imaginality: Don't be sure of scumpair on day one before the flip.<br>\nOkay that we[re] imaginalitys good argument right?\") My iso 5-7 give my reasons for suspecting StefanB, none of which were about scumpairs. (At the end of iso7, I said that I suspected <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">andrew94</div> for that reason, but I didn't use it as an extra point in my StefanB case.) In 223, I like that StefanB didn't put [L] at L-1 yet - that actually seemed pro-town... except that the final line pointing out how 'ultrascummy' of him it was not to vote throws that into question by linking the reason for not voting with \"I know all hate this but I will be bussy with defending myself, so yes...\" rather than it just being about not wanting the day to end yet. <br>\n<br>\nProbably the best point in his favour is the way andrew94 and Mist7676 both hopped on his wagon opportunistically, though as I said earlier I could see that as scum bussing almost as much as scum wagoning town, so it's not a very strong argument against StefanB being scum.<br>\n<br>\nOverall, there's plenty still niggling at me about StefanB and, while I can see there are newbie-tells and communication confusion muddying the waters, if you remove those null tells what's left still looks more scum than town. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Others</div><br>\n<br>\nC-Worl(andrew94) - jumping on [L] wagon with minimal reasoning isn't a good start. I gave some reasons to suspect andrew94 previously. I'll withhold judgment on C-Worl until the 'full catch-up' but I do want to ask this:<br>\n<br>\n@C-Worl: why vote if not fully caught up? Are you sure just from your skim that you'd be happy with an [L] lynch if that happened before you'd fully caught up? <br>\n<br>\n[L] - crazypianist (217 and 244) makes good points against [L], as does Jase (206, 210, and 225) and Zdenek (128 and 154).  224 from [L], aside from Jase's point, is also an unfair response to StefanB's lack of vote as it completely ignores the not-wanting-the-day-to-end possible reason for not voting. I don't feel quite sure enough to switch my vote to [L] yet, but I'm certainly not opposed to an [L] lynch at this point.<br>\n<br>\n@[L], in 172 why did you say you \"Currently, I had to remove my vote to see how [tarsonisocelot] behaves\"? <br>\n<br>\n@yabbaguy, is your reason for backing off on [L] only that tarsonisocelet is attacking [L] and is scummier?)<br>\n<br>\nProx(Mist(GroupThink)) - I didn't like the way Mist7676 joined the StefanB wagon in 143. And avoiding commenting on [L] and SurpriseCarcinogen in his reads, then delaying (and avoiding) answering Uncle Pain's question about them, is suspicious in my eyes. Sign of scum wanting to see how the town's opinion lies before answering? Prox's first post doesn't inspire me with any greater confidence. <br>\n<br>\nActually, you know what, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote; vote: Prox</div> I want to see where this goes. I think there's already enough reason to apply a vote here. <br>\n<br>\n@Prox: What about tarsonisocelot's iso don't you like? Who else would you support a lynch of? <br>\n<br>\nredtail896 - post 188 read well to me, and I agreed with Surprise Carcinogen's reads. redtail896's, too. Since replacing in, he seems to be actively scumhunting. Leaning town here.<br>\n<br>\ntarsonisocelot - is the case against her that she's been fluff-posting? I don't see it. Early on, I guess, but from say iso 10 onwards she's been giving some good content. E.g:<br>\n<br>\niso 11 - good pressure on [L] for unvoting<br>\niso 12 - yabba and Jase read<br>\niso 13 - questions StefanB<br>\niso 14 - more [L] pressure<br>\niso 15 - okay this was IIoA, I'll grant<br>\niso 16 - explains stuff<br>\n<br>\nI'm not that much of a fan of the 're-read in parts' approach she's taking right now, but I don't think the wagon on her is justified. <br>\n<br>\nAnyone not commented on above I read as town. In particular Me=Weird, crazypianist1116, Jase, and Uncle Pain. yabbaguy and Zdenek I'm less sure of (yabbaguy for overstating the tarsonisocelot case), but also leaning town on.", "time": "Wed May 04, 2011 3:05 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17289&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "17289"}

Replacements catching up, TOs reread analysis. The biggest thing is I don't want the day to end without our replacements being well integrated into the game.

Going through page by page the way she is it makes sense that the early stuff wouldn't draw much analysis because for one early cases tend to be weak, and two hindsight is a thing.

Jase focuses on him and looks thoroughly for every clue that points to scum; C-Worl calls Jase on the tunnelling and insists on being town that made a mistake on Day 1. I think Jase&#8217;s case is justified and I support squeezing out reactions from C-Worl. One thing I found interesting to read:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>C-Worl wrote:</cite>If you wish to gain more out of today why don't you target other players that are not me <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">since the wagon on me apparently isn't going anywhere.</div></div></blockquote>(bold by me)<br>\nNote that a lot of us could easily put you to L-1. And to be honest, currently I wouldn&#8217;t mind if it weren&#8217;t for gaining more information during this Day. You&#8217;re not reading obvious scum to me but your hammer is just too large a stain on your slate.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>yabbaguy wrote:</cite>Oh, and that case tarson-scum really wants me to state: Carcinogen's ISO is fluffing mostly, especially with stupid advice like this: <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>GroupThink, you need to explain yourself.

I find myself guilty of this tunnelling as well.<br>\n<br>\nAs it seems, tarsonisocelot is viewed as a recovering townie by now after her lack of real participation on Day 1. As Me=Weird stated, her <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3044102#p3044102\" class=\"postlink\">#386</a> was indeed a substantial post: she suspects C-Worl and redtail896 the most. While her case on C-Worl is pretty obvious, she doesn&#8217;t vote him so that Day 2 is prolonged. This is basically a town move and falls in line with Jase&#8217;s behaviour but to be honest it&#8217;s also easy for scum to pretend this so I say it&#8217;s a null tell.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>tarsonisocelot wrote:</cite>Prox-slot: Null due to non-contribution. Slight town-lean because surely at least one of them would have been more interested if the slot was scum.</div></blockquote><br>\nI don&#8217;t really like this one. She ignores the odd behaviour coming from that slot and implies that scum would have been more active &#8594; WIFOM. Well surprise, lurking is actually a good scum move, so I even tend to put the lurking issue on the scummier side. Unfortunately, RangeroftheNorth currently is no better. So I wonder what is so townie about this slot, tarsonisocelot?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe redtail896 case, as far as I see it, revolves around three things:<br>\n<ul><li>the prepared vote switch from C-Worl to tarsonisocelot once it looks more promising (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3028227#p3028227\" class=\"postlink\">#319</a>)<br>\n</li><li>the over-sensitive reaction to [L]&#8217;s question (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3010295#p3010295\" class=\"postlink\">#208</a>)<br>\n</li><li>the alleged sheeping of popular votes in his first analysis post (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3008124#p3008124\" class=\"postlink\">#188</a>)</li></ul><br>\nI already stated my hesitance towards the second point. The first one indeed holds water, I&#8217;d like to hear from redtail896 some elaboration about it. I&#8217;m not sure about the third one, though; his post comes to me as genuine, especially because he voted tarsonisocelot to investigate her more instead of just going for the most scummy one. As scum, it would&#8217;ve been easier to do the latter.<br>\n<br>\nAny notes from anyone on these cases?", "time": "Tue May 17, 2011 11:08 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17289&start=400", "forum": "53", "thread": "17289"}

And this question to yabbaguy:<br>\n<br>\n\"So your case against redtail896, which reads to me basically as gut feeling, is more convincing to you that the C-Worl wagon? Plus, why are you suddenly not so sure any more about tarsonisocelot-scum?\"<br>\n<br>\n361 from Me=Weird seems scummy-ish, like trying to get a quick-hammer (especially since any townie who did so would likely be lynched tomorrow regardless of C-Worl's flip). C-Worl calling her scum for voting him suggests she's bussing him, if he flips scum.<br>\n<br>\nJase's point about a possible Uncle Pain - redtail connection is interesting, though I still have a good townread on Uncle Pain. <br>\n<br>\n373 from yabbaguy misrepresents crazypianist, I think? I thought lining up lynches is when you say, \"If X flips {scum/town} then we lynch Y tomorrow.\" crazypianist is just saying \"lynch TO tomorrow\". It seems independent of today's lynch. This is just a terminology point though.<br>\n<br>\n374 tarsonisocelot's reasons for worrying about a self-hammer sound genuine.<br>\n<br>\n378 from Zdenek (answering Uncle Pain's question) sounds genuine<br>\n<br>\nC-Worl's posts on this page are townier than the previous couple of pages.<br>\n<br>\ntarsonisocelot's reads in 386 are mostly well-reasoned but I disagree with this on yabbaguy: \"There are a few inconsistencies, such as where he's not sure if [L] is an ok wagon or a terrible one but I think scum would have been more careful to avoid this.\" Scum make mistakes, it's how we catch them. It doesn't seem too glaring a mistake to use that 'too scummy to be scum' dismissal of it.<br>\n<br>\nwow, interesting to see bvoigt follow up yabbaguy's suspicion of Uncle Pain. And boldly calling C-Worl town. <br>\n<br>\nI think Uncle Pain is right to question bvoigt's read of him, it seems like bvoigt just trying to stick with his slot's previous reads, which I see as scummy. On the other hand, the \"I'm not affiliated with redtail\" remark is pretty odd - tarsonisocelot is right to call him on this.<br>\n<br>\n406 from crazypianist I like. <br>\n<br>\n413 from redtail feels inadequate as an explanation. <br>\n<br>\n415 where bvoigt says he'll keep his vote on redtail cos yabbaguy voted him - I don't like that. <br>\n<br>\nTo answer the question to me (\"One random thing I noticed. Why did you say that hammering in that situation made them likely to be buddies?\"), that misrepresents what I said, which was only that it was <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">possible</div> [L] was scum, despite the quickhammer on him. I thought if [L] flipped scum, I could see the hammer as an attempt to get townpoints for bussing while also cutting the day short. i.e. the hammer looked scummy to me whichever way [L] flipped.<br>\n<br>\n@Uncle Pain, I think the other point that's been made against redtail896 is Surprise Carcinogen's fluff-posting.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nMy current reads:<br>\n<br>\nScum<br>\n.<br>\n.<br>\nC-Worl - the first few pages of today really read as scum rather than town. I was suspicious of andrew94 on Day1, too. And the hammer is of course the biggest point here.<br>\n.<br>\nbvoigt - see notes for some reasons. Looking back on D1, I think he's been given too much towncredit for the opening gambit, which, while I can see wasn't scummy, could have been a prepared opening by scum as much as by town. <br>\n.<br>\nRangerofthenorth - there's not a lot to go on, but at this stage in the game that's somewhat telling in itself. Ranger's got a lot to do to make up for the combined impression the previous inhabitants of this slot have made. It's mostly a lurkcase but we're well into Day 2, continued lurkiness looks increasingly suspect. And my earlier comment in #249 made some other points: <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>imaginality 249 wrote:</cite>Prox(Mist(GroupThink)) - I didn't like the way Mist7676 joined the StefanB wagon in 143. And avoiding commenting on [L] and SurpriseCarcinogen in his reads, then delaying (and avoiding) answering Uncle Pain's question about them, is suspicious in my eyes. Sign of scum wanting to see how the town's opinion lies before answering? Prox's first post doesn't inspire me with any greater confidence.</div></blockquote><br>\n.<br>\n.<br>\n.<br>\nMe=Weird - swaying here.

Ideally something would be brought up that would start a wagon that gains enough support to be considered competitive to the c-worl wagon, sparking a whirlwind of discussion. The second bit (I think) is pretty clearly misinterpreting my want for another wagon. I don't want to know who else people think we could maybe lynch instead of c-worl, obviously if we lynched immediately c-worl would be best. I want people to look for a GOOD wagon.

Where is the sense in that? bvoigt actually served scum by judging C-Worl as town. WIFOM situation: either bvoigt&#8217;s other reads were better and would have made problems for scum (if he had had the chance to pursue them more), or scum wants to make us think just that. Since bvoigt had redtail896 and me as his main suspects, I smell that the latter is the case. This is where Jase&#8217;s idea of a link between me and redtail896 could come handy. I myself did a quick skim over both our posts and didn&#8217;t find anything really besides my defence part (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3038430#p3038430\" class=\"postlink\">#366</a>).<br>\n<br>\nApart from that, I&#8217;m at a loss right now. Regarding our past wagons, tarsonisocelot really doesn&#8217;t give me as scummy of a read as she used to, and redtail896 has been pretty townie in my eyes all along. imaginality has a valid point with his andrew94 re-read but I&#8217;ll have to look into that myself to draw any conclusions.

Now that two night passed by without anything special, I conclude there probably is neither a vigilante nor a serial killer in the game. If there&#8217;s a doc/jailkeeper, he&#8217;s had no luck so far. If there&#8217;s a cop/tracker/watcher, I wonder what results he has got so far (if he wasn&#8217;t roleblocked, that is). I&#8217;m not familiar with games of this size but I tend to believe that the mod will probably not have chosen a mountainous setup; 11 vanilla vs. 2 goons sounds too easy for town to me, 10 vanilla vs. 3 goons sounds too easy for scum to me, so I suspect we have 3 Mafia players and 10 townies with at least one having a power role.", "time": "Tue May 24, 2011 4:19 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17289&start=450", "forum": "53", "thread": "17289"}

You cannot excuse how blatantly you avoided commenting on c-worl with \"I was busy scum hunting.\" You didn't comment on him, you tried to start other wagons and instead of asking you about c-worl, uncle pain asked you about these other wagons.

I've played games with you where the scum were the most active players and certainly made every effort to keep others active.

I kept notes of everything I found scummy or townie, and then only posted what was relevant once I had read the entire thread and gauged my reads.

However, once I've finished reading the game and am confident in my scum reads, things like this stay in because they're relevant. It's not just one isolated incident.

It's definitely scummy when you avoid each other almost entirely, and even more scummy when you pointedly ask him questions which have nothing to do with the obvscum at L-1.

You know Bvoigt would go after you today, and you couldn't have that, especially with the rest of the town thinking you smell of roses.

With the lynch occurring in the meantime, many of the questions as well as the intention itself became obsolete (Day 2 was now practically over). If no one had asked for it, I wouldn&#8217;t have posted it because of said obsolescence. But imaginality asked for it and so I posted it nonetheless.

It reads plausible at first and if I were you, the things you pointed out would bother me as well. But there are some problems that I don&#8217;t accept and I won&#8217;t give up just because you found coincidences and bad play.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>You are avoiding the crux of the issue which is that the nature of your interactions make you likely buddies. See my response to Zdenek.</div></blockquote><br>\nI&#8217;m not avoiding it, I just don&#8217;t know what to say. You have your opinion and I have mine, neither of us can prove anything to the other.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>You kill your own argument here. You've targeted my slot as scummy for low activity, but were giving Zdenek a pass. See the problem? And it's not just low activity, it's letting him get away with minimal content and avoiding topics he should've been commenting on.</div></blockquote><br>\nThere&#8217;s a difference between low activity as in active lurking and low activity as in posting less without loss in quality. My argument was that <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">&#8220;Zdenek may have posted less than others but he did contribute to the discussions&#8221;</div>, your predecessors on the other hand were worse than that because they almost didn&#8217;t contribute anything and even got away with that.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>Nope. Yours definitely looked the most like bussing. I kept notes of everything I found scummy or townie, and then only posted what was relevant once I had read the entire thread and gauged my reads. You're trying to paint me as having decided who I thought was scum before reading the thread, and that is not the case.</div></blockquote><br>\nExactly this is my impression and you even gave the reason for it yourself: you made notes of everything scummy but decided to post just this one case. This is detrimental for town because it makes judging you and your motives harder for us. And, as I said, it looks convenient.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>He's clearly coming to your defense there, but trying to be subtle about it. How is this a stretch?</div></blockquote><br>\nAlready before with the redtail896 thing I really didn&#8217;t understand the fuss about defending someone. While you prefer to call it a defence, to me it looks by far more like digging deeper. Stating questions about possible contradictions is pro-town, regardless of andrew94&#8217;s alignment.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>It's never the exact same. Timing, place on the wagon, their play up to that point and afterward... all kinds of factors which makes yours look like bussing and redtail's look townish.</div></blockquote><br>\nThis looks so plainly arbitrary, I wonder if that even was a defence for redtail896/chkflip?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>You're like a bad defense attorney. It's definitely scummy when you avoid each other almost entirely, and even more scummy when you pointedly ask him questions which have nothing to do with the obvscum at L-1. I anticipate reading the scum qt N1 and seeing one of you or Zdenek say \"We've been avoiding each other too much. Let's be sure to interact more D2.\" Then Zdenek said, \"OK, you bus the crap out of Mr. Obvscum Quickhammer and I'll make cases elsewhere to see if anything sticks.\"</div></blockquote><br>\nI had to smile when I read that because it&#8217;s actually not hard to imagine. I fear I must disappoint you, you won&#8217;t see any QuickTopic with me in it, not for this game. But your point here lead me to an interesting thought. I skimmed Day 2 to check it and it looks true: I am guilty for not having asked Zdenek more &#8211; and so are <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">all the others</div>. bvoigt was the first and only one asking Zdenek specifically for his read on C-Worl, guess what, he got nightkilled. In this light, the NK actually makes sense, scum saw a well-performing townie in him, in contrast to us mediocre ones.<br>\nMy point is: you&#8217;re picking me specifically to make your case although others have done the same and should be as scummy for it as I am.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>at this point, no, I'm not even considering that you and Zdenek might not be scum buddies. I tend to doubt my reads too easily and I'm done with that. If one of you flip town and I realize I'm wrong, I would still think the other is scum since I do find you scummy independently of the connections between you.</div></blockquote><br>\nNow things become interesting&#8230; First, how very convenient to pick this game situation to be done with doubting your reads. Second, your case revolves primarily around connections between Zdenek and me. If these fall apart, your case is gone. If you actually have arguments against me in special, show me. Otherwise I call you out on throwing dirt at me with nothing to back it up.<br>\nBy the way, why tell Powerrox93 that you were after an Uncle Pain/Jase scum team? What does he have to do with this?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>Have you really not heard of distancing? How many games have you played?</div></blockquote><br>\nIf you&#8217;re interested in meta, read my wiki page. Of course I know distancing but attacking the partner out of the blue would seem too risky to me if I were scum, especially when town would otherwise focus on a townie wagon. This is getting a subjective matter, though, a question of play style and the like.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>Well, clearly that's a risk you were willing to take. You know Bvoigt would go after you today, and you couldn't have that, especially with the rest of the town thinking you smell of roses. You knew you could NK him and WIFOM would keep the town from being too suspicious about it.</div></blockquote><br>\nI say scum wants town to make us think that.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>That makes no sense. A townie isn't preoccupied with being considered a perfect townie and feeling pressure to keep a pristine town reputation. They're concerned with finding scum and just keeping enough suspicion off to not get mislynched.</div></blockquote><br>\nFull ack for the last sentence. And now think about it: when everyone thinks I&#8217;m super-townie, doesn&#8217;t this put me in a strange WIFOMly light? Of course this builds up some kind of pressure! I don&#8217;t want to be mislynched because as much as I want to win for town, I also play for my personal fun and being lynched or killed somewhat puts a halt to this. Or so I imagine; I have so far actually never been lynched, I guess this kind of fuels the fire for surviving. Man, this is getting psychological now.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>But if you wrote the post to try to squeeze more info out of d2, why wouldn't you still post it? You surely thought c-worl would inevitably be hammered when you wrote it, yes? So nothing should change as far as your motivations for posting it just because c-worl hammered himself. And it is inaccurate to say it was all obsolete because of the hammer. That post contained several statements/attacks on players that were not c-worl, and all of the bolded were not affected by the hammer:</div></blockquote><br>\nNo, I never call a Day done, I write my posts with the belief that the Day&#8217;s outcome is open. C-Worl&#8217;s lynch could have been averted by another strong wagon, the chances were slight but I don&#8217;t write off someone only because he&#8217;s at L-1.<br>\nIt&#8217;s embarrassing for me but I admit I haven&#8217;t re-read that post since I archived it in my text file. When imaginality asked for it, I just C&amp;P&#8217;ed it without looking at it, I have already written it off as obsolete because the situation was totally different then. Thank you for pointing out the specific questions that are still valid, I will pursue them.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>If a player with a pro-town rep pointed this out before you did, it could have gone very badly for you. You were obviously aware of this, and so posted it first. Savvy?</div></blockquote><br>\nErm.

I incriminated myself, thus making it even easier for others to follow the reasoning.

Well, as I stated above: you blame <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">me</div> for not calling him out on this when in fact everyone else (except bvoigt) is guilty for this as well. I want a good reason why no one else looks scummy for this. Otherwise I consider it just another arbitrary choice to make your case work.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>Most players are aware that town PRs have a tendency to lay low. The only argument you have against my slot is that all those who've played in it have been fairly inactive. The jump to assume scum PR instead of town PR with the mod outguess reasoning you provided only makes sense if you're trying to paint my slot as scummy.</div></blockquote><br>\nIt&#8217;s the other way round: your slot pinged my scumdar and <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">then</div> I searched for scummy clues about you. What you call painting your slot scummy is in fact backing up my feeling with some evidence. I have by now understood that outguessing is a bad idea and I retracted it. Can we get over with this now?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>Thinking aloud about power roles (if that's what you call what you did) is not much different from role fishing.

I was merely stating my thoughts.<br>\nBesides, what&#8217;s the difference, hunting scum in general versus hunting scum power roles?

Sorry it's not as convenient as you were hoping. The last game I replaced into the scum team was a bit more obvious than here so it was easier to not doubt my reads. It worked splendidly and we won. Before that though, I found scum and then let myself get talked out of it in 3 games in a row. All 3 led to a loss.

For example, you have no problem with him having a town read on you for activity and not saying much else about you. Scum motivation abounds for you to do this whether Zdenek is scum or town, but a townie would just find it suspect. Also, it's scummy that you asked Zdenek about the alternate wagons he was trying to create while c-worl was at L-1 whether Zdenek is scum or town. If you were a townie, you'd have been suspicious of him ignoring c-worl and trying to distract from the wagon. Scum motivation to draw attention to the other wagons Zdenek was trying to start is obvious. He could've been town scum hunting while ignoring c-worl (very unlikely, but, you know, hypothetical) and you'd still have been scum for trying to move attention away from c-worl to his other suspects.<br>\n<br>\nAll of this from my original case is you scummy independent of Zdenek:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite><br>\np125 Uncle Pain defends Andrew. &#8220;imaginality: A beautiful case you&#8217;ve built here.

Here's a question. In all these games where you've never been lynched, were you scum in any of them? I'm guessing your play as scum was very similar to here, but that it's also similar to your play as town. So since you know people read your scum play as town and you know you should not be considered town just because you're very active, if you are town you should have a problem with players clearing you as town for your activity level. (Wouldn't you agree that scum would target a weaker/less active player before you. A player as active as you is very difficult to get lynched, if just because players, especially newer ones, assume you're town JUST because of playstyle/activity level). If you are scum, I'd expect you to just go with it and be glad you're not being suspected, which is what you're doing.", "time": "Mon May 30, 2011 4:59 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17289&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "17289"}

You would not say this if you were town.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nLooking down at your 514 where you list the points that are independent of me:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite><br>\np125 Uncle Pain defends Andrew. &#8220;imaginality: A beautiful case you&#8217;ve built here.

I agree this is odd.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite><br>\nc-worl: \"Not enough for you? Hammered myself to keep suspicion of Uncle Pain from building up.\" So you can say what you want about c-worl&#8217;s WIFOM, but this one makes sense, and I think it is true.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nI think it is best that we ignore C-Worl.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite><br>\nAnd then post 444 UP posts it...and it&#8217;s questions for most the players.

This is just thinly veiled role fishing combined with an attempt to cast suspicion on my slot with crap mod-outguess reasoning.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nThis is a good point.<br>\n<br>\nAs far as the activity argument goes. Looking back at those games, in Neruzian Mafia of the slots that were alive at the end:<br>\n<br>\nFaraday had 246 posts<br>\nVi had 99 (scum)<br>\nQuilford + Setael had 94<br>\nSloth had 63 <br>\nHiplop had 59 (scum)<br>\nDarth Yoshi + Juls had 54<br>\n<br>\nVi was active as scum, but I'd judge her separately from most other players.<br>\n<br>\nIn Nexusville Mafia:<br>\n<br>\nneil+King1216 128<br>\nq21+setael 101<br>\nDarth Yoshi (scum) 72<br>\nImplosion 51<br>\nNeko2086(scum) 47<br>\nWOMC+Swiftstrike 47<br>\nZdenek (scum) 44<br>\n<br>\nSo scum weren't the most active players. In the first, I think Hiplop was in no way trying to keep other people in the game, and that while Vi might have been, her interactions with other people, esp. Quilford and Hiplop were awkward. In the second game, Swiftstrike had DY pegged as scum because of the sort of questions he was asking. I don't mean to argue that activity is a good town-tell, but I do think that activity in the absence of scum-tells is.<br>\n<br>\nIn summary, I think there some oddities in the things that UP has said, the contrast between his reaction to bvoigt's suspicion of him and being relieved that someone is suspicious of him and not originally posting the post of questions he wrote before C-Worl's hammer.

And what exactly do you mean by bad play?</div></blockquote><br>\nFrom my point of view so far, bad play has been:<br>\n<ul><li>minor: random voting without realizing the RVS was already ending/ended<br>\n</li><li>major: overfocusing on the active players and ignoring the others<br>\n</li><li>so-so: creating confusion about defending redtail896<br>\n</li><li>major: not posting my Day 2 questions immediately despite their legitimacy</li></ul><br>\nAs you can see, by bad play I mean actions or situations that I handled badly.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>I find that if I post all my notes going through the whole game, people I no longer suspect get distracted defending against those things and the scum use those things to distract. I would much rather focus on who I think is scum, which is what I'm doing.</div></blockquote><br>\nIt&#8217;s okay to focus, I just wanted to make sure we know what you&#8217;re thinking about everyone of us. We need a read on you as well, after all.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>No one else asked Zdenek questions about the other cases he made while c-worl was at L-1 while completely avoiding asking him about c-worl. So, no, you can't compare yourself to the others and say I should also see them as scummy.</div></blockquote><br>\nI really don&#8217;t get your logic. No one asks Zdenek for his read on C-Worl, we&#8217;re all guilty for that, yet no one is scummy to you for that. Then I do ask him a few other things (which isn&#8217;t scummy by itself) and suddenly I look scummy. I really don&#8217;t get it. Read: I do something townish and become scummy to you. I may have failed to see the wide hole (C-Worl) but I still had a good intention in asking him things and we even got useful responses. You call me scummy because of your theory that I tried to distract town but assuming such a thing implies that you had me in mind as scum beforehand. Therefore the distraction theory is based on your assumption that I am scum. You see where this leads? Circular logic.

It worked splendidly and we won. Before that though, I found scum and then let myself get talked out of it in 3 games in a row. All 3 led to a loss.

I'm guessing your play as scum was very similar to here, but that it's also similar to your play as town.

If someone wants to meta me, they can go ahead, I myself don&#8217;t feel any obligation to create any behavioural rules to restrict my town and scum play. For what it&#8217;s worth, I have been scum only once and I think my scum play was noticeably different from my town play.

So, I think either Zdenek = town or Zdenek and UnclePain are the scumteam. I.e. I don't see Zdenek scum and Uncle Pain town as very likely. But, I've had a pretty solid town read on Uncle Pain for most of the game, and his defense has been calmly, clearly argued, so I'm leaning towards them both being town. <br>\n<br>\nI like Setael's play, too, though. His case against Zdenek and Uncle Pain is over-certain at times and some points were stretches, but my gut says he is more likely town than scum. I've been impressed with the way he seems to be actually analysing stuff rather than offering lazy reads. <br>\n<br>\nSo, I lean towards Setael, Zdenek and Uncle Pain all being town. <br>\n<br>\nOn the other hand, chkflip/redtail896's lack of interest in the day fits with possible scum sitting back watching a town vs town spat, as does tarsonisocelot's lack of comment. Jase was pretty fence-sitty about Setael's attack vs Uncle Pain's defense, but I give him high town points for previous days and, despite the stoush at the start of today, I still think he's likely town.<br>\n<br>\nYesterday, there really wasn't much effort to put forward an alternative to the C-Worl lynch. To me it seems quite likely the mafia decided N1 to bus him rather than try to rescue him from the fairly blatant quick-hammer. That points towards early bussing rather than late bussing, which to me suggests chkflip/redtail896 as a likely scumbuddy.

He even gives a few reasons to be suspicious of Stefan, but then says his read on him is null. Could definitely see him scum with uncle pain because otherwise he&#8217;d have at least commented on the uncle pain wagon which was at 3 votes here. Answers Uncle Pain&#8217;s question about Stefan but doesn&#8217;t comment on Pain at all.<br>\n<br>\nUncle pain 321 c-worl vote is almost definitely bussing <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Again, why?</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">3.</div> Zdenek post 330 tries to derail cworl wagon and start one on redtail. Then in 360 he&#8217;s agreeing with uncle pain that Redtail is scummy for supposedly preparing an escape from the c-worl wagon. If this is the case, and Zdenek thinks c-worl is scum, why isn&#8217;t he voting c-worl? Or mentioning him at all? Then when the redtail wagon doesn&#8217;t take, in post 424 when c-worl is at L-1 he tries to get momentum moved to crazypianist. <br>\n<br>\nThe interaction between zdenek and uncle pain while c-worl was about to be lynched is fishy. It&#8217;s like Uncle Pain was seeing that the townies were letting zdenek fly under the radar, so he made sure to ask him lots of questions, just not about c-worl. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Post numbers?</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">4.</div> Bvoigt was NK'd for uncle pain suspicion in posts 393 and 432. <br>\n<br>\nP399 Uncle Pain says: \"bvoigt: How can you explain that everyone else sees me town but you see me scummy?\" Sounds like something scum would say - upset they're losing their free pass. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Good point.

Two townies at L-2. Zdenek keeps pushing the L wagon and defending Stefan. Redtail replaces in and votes TO even though he also has a scum read on L. Could go either way on this - I've certainly replaced in as scum and avoided the main wagons, but since both the wagons have flipped town, I can't help but think that scum would've thrown their weight behind one of them at the point that Red replaced in. He did state a scum read on L which left him open to hammer, though so not sure what I think about that.<br>\n<br>\nUP is also pushing L and so is Jase, both accusing her of not defending. I don't see this at all and thought her defense and frustration was pretty obvtown. Jase's play looks more like town with how hard he was pushing and the things he was saying. UP's is more like scum gently pushing a mislynch.<br>\n<br>\nUP lists his scum picks as TO, L and myself. UP, why did you target my slot today over TO?<br>\n<br>\nc-worl replaces in and puts L at L-1.<br>\n<br>\nImaginality then votes Prox. Unlikely scum would look elsewhere like this with 2 juicy mislynches on the table.<br>\n<br>\nDemonHybrid's posts 260 and 262 listed a lot of suspicion on Zdenek and UP. Didn't notice this the first read-through, but this is probably a bit part of why he was killed N1.<br>\n<br>\nSo then the VC is:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>[L] (5) - tarsonisocelot, Zdenek, crazypianist1116, C-Worl, Uncle Pain<br>\ntarsonisocelot (4) - yabbaguy, redtail896, [L], Prox<br>\nDemonHybrid (1) - Me=Weird<br>\nProx (1) - imaginality<br>\nJase (1) - DemonHybrid<br>\n<br>\nNot voting (1) - Jase</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis gives me a bad feeling about my reads, actually. If I'm right about the scum team, all 3 of them were on the L wagon here. I don't recall c-worl saying anything about TO really (i'll have to look back again) but it's highly likely everyone on that TO wagon is town. Redtail's the only one I'm not sure about and I'm definitely leaning town on him. So maybe I'm wrong about either UP or Zdenek and one of them is scum with TO. I'll have to think about this.<br>\n<br>\nI'm ok with imaginality's L-1 vote, though it kind of negates the town points he had for looking elsewhere. I can definitely see a townie getting behind that L wagon though so it's pretty null. obv c-worl's hammer was scummy... since he was scum.

This is the day most of Sets Zed case comes from. Get's really lurky near the end of the day. I call for a counter wagon, as C-worl was the only one with  a shot at being the lynch.

Good point about chkflip's response to his criticism of his (lack of) posting. Also, I agree Setael's unvoting in preparation for possibly changing her seems odd. <br>\n<br>\n584 Pine - I quite like the \"Can anyone tell me why they haven't been lynched?\" line. Not that anyone answered but it seems a useful question to ask for trying to form reads based on people's answers. In my view: Jase didn't get lynched because once he'd explained his reaction-testingy early play, he was very obvtown from then on. tarsonisocelot didn't get lynched because [L] looked pretty scummy. I actually forgot tarsonisocelot was second wagon for the latter part of that day though. Might explain why C-Worl took the chance to quickhammer?<br>\n<br>\n593 mastin2 - as mentioned, criticising the wagon on Setael without having formed a read on her yet seems suspicious. 595 doesn't really excuse it, since it came across as expressing disapproval (especially since the 'neither' equates it with the wagon on himself, which he can be expected to disapprove of), rather than merely a null read. <br>\n<br>\nThe excessive excusing of his slow re-reading seems.. hm. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@mastin2</div>, can you provide a few links to other games you've replaced into recently? <br>\n<br>\n598 mastin2 - The tarsonisocelot suspicion seems vaguely expressed, especially \"I'm not sure if it's logic, gut, or a combination thereof which makes me suspicious of her.\"\" Usually easy to tell logic from gut, I'd say. I'm wondering if the \"I suspect TO but not too sure, maybe I'm tunnelling\" is an attempt to get someone else to make a case against her first. <br>\n<br>\n601 mastin2 - four days to complete your re-read, that close to deadline? I don't like the attitude of \"that should leave enough time to stop mislynches\". I feel like you were hoping to let town get on with mislynching and not have to contribute to the discussion in the meantime, until it was down to one or two wagons. <br>\n<br>\nAt least the deadline's extended now so we should have a decent amount of time to mull over the conclusions of your re-read/VCA. <br>\n<br>\n607 Setael - Don't like this comment to Uncle Pain: \"Are you seriously trying to make me look suspicious for NOT tunneling?\" You can not tunnel and not unvote, you know... <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>What do YOU think of TO's statement that she finds both you and Zdenek town (him less so but meh) but if Zdenek flipped scum you'd be guaranteed scum? I have a huge problem with it, especially considering she hasn't said what if anything she agrees with as far a connections between you 2. I'm surprised you don't have a problem with it as well IF you're not scum with zdenek.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIf UP = scum and Zdenek = scum, he'd also have reason to want to cast doubt on the \"If Zdenek flips scum UP is scum\" hypothesis. So him casting doubt on it would be pretty null, which means him not casting doubt on it is also kinda null. <br>\n<br>\n608 Jase - I still feel like C-Worl seemed so clearly the likely lynch from so early D2 that scum are more likely on that wagon than off it. (For example, no-one backed up Zdenek's \"the hammer wasn't scummy\" suggestion, and even Zdenek offered that too weakly to seem like scum genuinely trying to save scum from a lynch.)<br>\n<br>\n610 Uncle Pain - I like this question to tarsonisocelot: <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I don&#8217;t get this. You&#8217;ve seen me as a townie all the time. Now you look for connections and find a good scum team: Setael and Zdenek. It would then be sensible to lynch Zdenek BUT should he flip scum (as you expect) suddenly I am likely scum. WTF?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n613 Jase (and 618) - I think this is overly harsh on Me=Weird. I read his sentence as 'Setael hasn't changed that [read]' - it's clear from the following sentence he acknowledges she's been more active. <br>\n<br>\n616 tarsonisocelot - I don't like how she jumped on the Me=Weird wagon here.  <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Powerrox93 wrote:</cite>Setael (2) - Me=Weird, Pine<br>\nmastin2 (2) - Zdenek, imaginality<br>\nMe=Weird (2) - Jase, tarsonisocelot<br>\ntarsonisocelot (1) - mastin2<br>\nZdenek (1) - Setael<br>\n<br>\nNot voting (1) - Uncle Pain<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nNot liking the spread here, we could do with starting to consolidate this. <br>\n<br>\nThe last few pages make me feel better about Me=Weird, worse about Setael, mastin2, and tarsonisocelot. I'll stick with my mastin2 vote for now, but I'm happy to support a tarsonisocelot wagon also. Those two are definitely my preferred lynch choices for today. I could potentially be convinced to vote Setael, Pine or Me=Weird (in order of preference) but it would take a better case than I've seen so far. Not interested in Zdenek (mainly because I don't think his defending C-Worl is that strong of a point, and his town read on Uncle Pain early today looked much more likely from town than scum), Uncle Pain or Jase (both those two, especially Jase, have looked very town to me for most of the game).", "time": "Wed Jun 08, 2011 3:23 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17289&start=600", "forum": "53", "thread": "17289"}

Especially the point about his 598. I also agree with your point about Sets 607. About my 608 I disagree. While scum was very likely to be on the wagon it wouldn't be unheard of for at least one to be off, and as for Zdeneks defense of C-worl a strong defense would have been suicide should c-worl have been lynched. Zeds defense of him reads as scum doing what he can for his buddy by nudging town in another direction. As for your point about my 613 I could see it being poor wording for the part about interaction with c-worl, but the part about Sets non contribution was said twice in more or less the exact same way. That makes it hard to believe that it was just poor wording or miscommunication. The way he defends himself is suspicious as well saying \"I say those things (when he did) and your case is stupid and wrong\". He shouted about how I am a wrong lying liar instead of going on about how I misinterpreted a poorly worded suspicion. That is what makes his defense scummy (because again the wording of his posts on Set are pretty clear, he did say those things).", "time": "Wed Jun 08, 2011 8:23 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17289&start=625", "forum": "53", "thread": "17289"}

If I don't get solid reads, I wall. If I get emotional, I wall. If I have neither, I tend not to. The newbie game with DarthYoshi is an example of this--I had maybe two or three long walls, the rest of my posts quite short.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMy style briefly: since I'm fresh from retirement, I haven't settled down INTO a style, so my play changes with every game. It's honed with off-site experience combined with wisdom of my time away and time spent reading MD along with refining my methods of scumhunting, so my play is slowly improving every game. <br>\nThere's certainly some things remaining the same throughout all my games, but a lot of what \"Mastin2\" is hasn't been defined, yet, because I'm still trying to work that out, myself. <br>\n<br>\nGeneral trends--Scum: Start out calm, cool, and logical, generally seen as town. I put myself into my town meta, and it works beautifully. (However, I often am trapped--boxed in--by it, locking into an action which I feel I cannot back out of as scum more often than I do as town.) Initially. Then I freak out. The facade cracks; my mask disappears when emotions start to pour in--for instance, insulting me certain ways makes me sensitive as scum, whereas when I'm town, it doesn't bother me. (I dunno why.) <br>\n<br>\nTown: Impulsive, with certain compulsions. I follow feelings far more than I follow my head, doing whatever I think I should in order to win. I take a lot of risks that aren't exactly optimal play. While I do gambit as scum, I much prefer gambitting as town. I'm prone to overconfidence (related to confirmation bias tendencies and reverse-confirmation-bias), and I am slow to accept being wrong. That's pretty much as much as I know about my town meta. <br>\n<br>\nThird party: Only once. The Large \"Normal\" run by Jebus, with Llamafluff as the backup mod. I was a Lyncher, outed Day One by a JOAT who Rolecopped me.<br>\nI truthfully told the town everything--my true target, what I was planning on doing, how I was planning on winning, everything. And proceeded to try and legitimately scumhunt...but people didn't believe me. We fought for 30 pages. I got distracted, emotional, stopped scumhunting and worked on defense. It didn't work; I got lynched Day One. When the game ended, I grumbled an \"I told you so!\" about my play having town's interests in mind.<br>\nSummary: I try to play identical to town, but when attacked, I react exactly as scum, the alignment acting as a bridge between the two sides, ironically.<br>\n<br>\nOther: I'm fond of meta. Both for myself, and others when I have the time. I know, bad habit. 'Been trying to get rid of it in my play, but it keeps coming back. 'Working theory: I am a sentimental guy who ponders the past, seeing what he's done well and what he's...'not done well'. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br>\n<br>\nI'm better at reading other's meta (when I research it enough) than mine. I Wall, always have, and--despite efforts to get rid of them--likely always will. It used to be that if I didn't wall, I was lethargic or dangerously close. AKA, lazily lurked around somehow managing to be more anti-town than walling. (As both alignments.) Either way, greatly anti-town, and have tried to stop that from being me again. I was a VI, who has become more wise (though not good &gt;_&lt;) with experience. <br>\n(Also, I evolved over time to become someone who tends to get strong reads, though it became tunneling often.)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI'm also quite fond of MD, if you haven't noticed.

Actively pursues clues, questions people, calls out lurkers. He may push a bit too far sometimes but I see genuine aggressive town intent behind it. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Town.</div><br>\n</li><li><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">tarsonisocelot</div>: ambivalent feeling about her. Her level of activity/contribution/commitment reads like a bell curve to me: first her bad start, then the recovery phase where she posted a lot, now decreasing again. I dislike her vote hopping from this Day, she seems unmotivated to build a real case to back up the votes. I also remember her IioA approach from Day 1 which looks like coming from either a lazy townie or from a calculating scum. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Null-scum.</div><br>\n</li><li><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Me=Weird</div>: a bit lurky in my eyes, my impression is that he isn&#8217;t good at making cases and thus likes to sheep others&#8217;. I fail to see real scum intent behind that though, his posts suggest he&#8217;s looking at many options at a time (not only the obvious wagons) and tries to get reads on people to have some confidence in his votes. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Null-town.</div><br>\n</li><li><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Zdenek</div>: Setael&#8217;s case revealed some interesting oddities in his play which he couldn&#8217;t clean himself from.

At some points I had this &#8220;too townie to be townie&#8221; feeling about him but it&#8217;s WIFOM and I can&#8217;t back it up. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Town.</div><br>\n</li><li><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Setael (RangeroftheNorth, Prox, Mist7676, GroupThink)</div>: the little amount and the kind of contribution from the four predecessors keep ringing in my head. Setael on the other hand made up for this with her walls; her former security in her case against Zdenek and me looked like scum pushing hard for mislynches but her current diffidence feels more like a townie rethinking the situation instead of scum looking for easier cases. I find it hard to judge this slot due to the massive difference in play style between Setael and the other four. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Null-scum.</div><br>\n</li><li><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">mastin2 (chkflip, redtail896, Surprise_Carcinogen)</div>: Surprise_Carcinogen never struck me as anti-town, redtail896 didn&#8217;t do much to disturb that feeling although there were some interesting points that could be seen as slips. But mastin2 doesn&#8217;t really convince me so far, his posts scream active lurking and voting before having read the thread is way off the pro-town route.

Pine on the other hand doesn&#8217;t fit in this picture, first he tries to get around contributing, then he reads the first five pages and casts his vote.

I have to gather my thoughts&#8230;<br>\n<br>\nFirst of all, thank you all for this game. I taught me a lot in ways I didn&#8217;t think about.<br>\n<br>\nI was in fact very surprised to see that Zdenek really was scum &#8211; his play was a bit lurkish but he never managed to rub me the wrong way really. I&#8217;m sorry I gave town the wrong impression that I could be a scumbuddy. I hope I&#8217;ll get better at this. At least I managed to not get targeted by scum; although my deputy role was only a backup role, I felt that it could get important.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">What I still don&#8217;t get is how scum knew so sure that crazypianist1116/Pine was the cop. Was it luck? If he did breadcrumb on Day 1, I fail(ed) to see it.</div> Having read the scum QuickTopic, it looks like pure luck that crazypianist1116 was chosen as the one to be blocked &#8211; and also Night 2! I wonder though what I did to be the second in line for this choice on Night 1 (QuickTopic #13) and why I was an &#8220;ultra-obvious target for a doc protect&#8221; during Night 1. Most had a good town read on me but is this alone enough to warrant a doc protection?<br>\nNevertheless, the two roleblocks on crazypianist1116 were a major drawback for town; had we not lynched Zdenek on Day 3 (thank goodness mastin2 managed to convince you of his claim), Day 4 wouldn&#8217;t have happened like it did. When I read the night choices, my first thought was why the hell scum didn&#8217;t kill the cop Night 1/2 but then I realized that by doing so they downgrade the cop to vanilla while killing others, which effectively means doing a better job while avoiding the risk of a possible deputy to take over (who in turn would have to be identified by scum first).<br>\nSo, good play scum team, you tricked me well the whole time.<br>\n<br>\nOn the other hand, I think that I myself don&#8217;t deserve the win. I tried to look for clues but I didn&#8217;t bring up much, especially compared to Setael&#8217;s elaborate case or Jase&#8217;s active hunting, and in fact I even managed to incriminate myself by saying stupid things that triggered scum reads for some of you. Especially Setael&#8217;s case against me was something I wasn&#8217;t sure I could defend against because yes, my play had flaws that she pulled to the surface with brilliant accuracy. What do I learn from this? I don&#8217;t know, I think I&#8217;m already quite careful about what I say but it seems it&#8217;s not sufficient.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Powerrox93 wrote:</cite>Anyway, this set-up looks a bit swingy with the deputy.

The setup looks fairly intuitive; as I said earlier in the game, 10 town vs. 3 scum looks balanced as long as town has power roles. In comparison to &#8220;traditional&#8221; setups (like F11 or Trendy and Subversive), you decided to trade town&#8217;s investigative power for protective power by putting in a bodyguard instead of a doctor (decreasing town&#8217;s protection) and by having a deputy (increasing town&#8217;s investigation) &#8211; I think it&#8217;s a fair trade and you should try the setup several times to see if there&#8217;s a tendency towards town or scum. As a game setup noob, I think it&#8217;s a good setup.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Powerrox93</div>: Thank you a lot for modding this game!

D1 he fitted with the 'being town but not so much so as to be nightkilled' sort of PR play, which was why I first suggested RBing him. Then before the night ended, I saw that breadcrumb which gave additional reason to go for him. <br>\n<br>\nD2, no-one else had suddenly looked more PR-y, so it made sense to just go for him again. <br>\n<br>\nAs for the comments about you N1, from my perspective you had been one of the towniest players during the day. (In fact I was a bit surprised at how much pressure you came under on D3.) A doc with no PR reads would probably protect one of the most useful players, so that's one reason why it made more sense for us to take out DemonHybrid, who'd only just joined but who already looked likely to us to become a big threat if we let him live.
