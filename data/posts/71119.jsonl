All normal site rules apply.<br>2. You may not talk about this game outside of this thread or any Private Threads created for this game.<br>3. Please remain civil with each other. Things can get heated or intense, but there are several things that will NOT be tolerated. Absolutely no offensive comments or slurs based on race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc. I WILL force replace you.<br>4. This is my color. There are many like it, but this one is mine. Do not use this color or any color too close to it.<br>5. Do not quote or pretend to quote any role PM, anything from a private thread, or mod communication. You can loosely paraphrase, but please use common sense.<br>6. Pretending to break a rule can result in the same action being taken as actually breaking the rule.<br>7. Do not try to manipulate or trick the mod.<br>8. Any minor/simple questions or pointing out errors in vote counts can be pointed out in thread by leading with a bolded @MOD at the start of a line.<br>9. Any more sensitive questions can be PM'd to me. Don't hesitate to ask if you have a question, you will not bother me.<br>10. If your spot in the game has been compromised due to outside information, please PM me immediately without making any more posts. I will be eternally grateful for your honesty.<br>11. I am not perfect. If you notice anything that is incorrect, let me know.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Voting</span></span><br><br>1. Voting must be made using the vote tags <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Shaziro</span> or using bold. I greatly prefer the vote tags though.<br>2. Any other variation will not be counted. I will let you know in thread once (if I notice it), but only once.<br>3. Misspellings, acronyms, and abbreviations will be valid as long as it is clear who you are voting for. If I perceive it as a vote, it is a vote.<br>4. Any votes within spoiler tags or otherwise concealed will not be counted.<br>5. A lynch will occur when 50%+1 (rounded down) of the votes are cast for the same player; a No Lynch will occur when 50%+1 (rounded down) of the votes are cast for that option or when there is not 50%+1 (rounded down) majority by deadline. When this has happened, any subsequent votes and unvotes will not be counted, and the game will enter twilight.<br>6. You may continue talking after a lynch or deadline has elapsed until the mod posts to end the day. After that, you may not post even if the mod forgets to lock the thread.<br>7. I will try to provide vote counts on a regular basis, with exception to the times when I am at class (which varies but is typically done before 4pm EST). You may request a new vote count at any time, and I will post it at my earliest convenience.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Activity/Day Night</span></span><br><br>1. Days will last two weeks. Deadline extensions will be granted only for the case of replacements, holidays, or other extreme circumstances.<br>2. Night phases will last for 2 days (48 hours)<br>3. Replacement during night phase will extend the deadline to 24 hours past the point of the replacement, whether that slot has a night action or not.<br>4. Actions must be PM'd to me or bolded in the Scum PT for it to be accepted. If no action is selected, they will not perform an action.<br>5. If mafia have powers other than their factional night kill, they may perform their power and the kill at the same time.<br>6. Prods will be sent out after 48 hours of inactivity. These will be announced in thread. At player request (if reasonable), I can \"Poke\" another player. This will not count as a prod.<br>7. If a player does not respond IN THREAD within 24 hours or receives 3 prods, they will be replaced out. If they return before a replacement is found, they may keep playing. The next time they are prodded, however, they will be replaced and can not return.<br>8. If you will be unable to be active in thread for over 48 hours, please make a V/LA post in bold. As long as the time is reasonable, you will be exempt from prods.<br>9. Once you are dead, you may no longer post in thread. No \"bah\" posts.<br><br>Mafia Team has Daytalk enabled in this game.<br><br>If you have any questions over your role or any of the rules in the game, feel free to PM me, you won't bother me!</span></span><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: CooLDoG's Role PM</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">You are a Vanilla Townie.<br><br>Your powers include your voice and your vote!

I've been told that I deliberately play town to make my scum game better. Which I do win the majority of my scum games, and late game I nail scum as town, if not become the closest one to doing it. Which is why the TSO quote is in my sig. I do deiberately play badly in a lot of my town games, but I still always play to win. I like seeing and reading people's reactions based directly towards me, as i read much better if I interact with people. Before I left site, people brought up that I purposefully play the village idiot when I'm not, and in my scum games, you can usually see that. Which is a big reason I tend not to get lynched very often, even though I'm usually prime mislynch bait. It does help me find scum, and it keeps me from getting night killed. I do tend to be night killed more often with players who are familiar with me rather than those who are just basing it off the game."}

Which is a big reason I tend not to get lynched very often, even though I'm usually prime mislynch bait. It does help me find scum, and it keeps me from getting night killed.

It feels like scum who has latched on to what they believe is an easy-to-justify tunnel. It seems like essentially every single thing that cooldog posts, he finds some scum motivation for. That doesn't look to me like a townie who is objectively trying to evaluate individual posts for which alignment they're indicative of; it looks like scum who thinks that they have found someone that they can list good logical reasons for voting, and so has decided to latch onto the read and push it because they know that they'll be able to look accurately logical in pushing it.<br><br>It conceivably could be town tunneling really badly but cooldog in particular in this game is, IMO, the kind of \"easy mislynch\" that is very attractive to scum (assuming that I'm right that he's town, which is of course not a given, but bear with me). Cooldog has posted a lot of very at-face-value jarring things, like calling out the claim early and criticizing the cmm wagon that he was on. These things are, IMO, really not alignment-indicative when you look past the surface of them (in the former case, as I've argued, scum empirically don't lie about things like thinking that a claim like that is a real claim, and this is further supported by fitz's thinking that it might have been real; in the latter case, his cmm vote was purely rvs while at least mine wasn't).<br><br>It's also not alignment-indicative but I absolutely despise this attitude:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Twoface wrote:</cite>everyone says that, yet I never have a crazy reaction when people I think are scum flip. most of the time I am right and when I am wrong, i don't really care because it was them that played like scum, so they deserved it.</div></blockquote><br>Saying that everyone you vote for deserved it is a surefire way to never improving your ability to read people. A mislynch is everyone's fault in different proportions that can never really be objectively evaluated. If you think someone is scummy and other people think they're towntelling and you were wrong it's your own damn fault for being wrong and not seeing the towntells for what they were, not that person's fault for being scummy."}

Is that AI to you? Answer and explain your reasoning</div></blockquote><br>Wow, not a leading question at all!<br><br>First, no, I would not say that this is a specific enough action to be alignment-indicative on its own. That's an extremely general action. There are tons of different ways to lie.<br><br>To answer the question that you're obviously intending to ask, I don't think cooldog has lied. If i'm reading correctly the lies are:<br>1) the thinking the claim was real, which I've argued about extensively and pointed out that havingfitz <span style=\"font-style: italic\">also thought it was real.</span> Did fitz lie too? Are they both scum for that?<br>2) the \"premeditated\" thing, where he says to wait for the vote-prodded response, then accuses wheme of only posting when prodded by votes. This is a much better point than point 1 actually, I'd say it's worth some amount of scumpoints for cooldog, but over my years on this site I have discovered and accounted for what was probably my largest bias: thinking that logic is indicative of town. It isn't, and the reverse holds as well: incorrect logic is not indicative of scum.<br><br>It's possible that cooldog set that up to try to make wheme look facetiously scummy, but (a) that's not a particularly strong way of getting others to agree with you because we'll obviously see through it and (b) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">it doesn't exactly take a lot to paint wheme as scummy</span>. Wheme is a player who naturally obscures his opinions and it's very easy to push a case on him; there's no need for scum-cooldog to go out of his way like this. It's still possible and so he gets some amount of scum points for that, but it's perfectly possible as well that he is simply perceiving the game through a different lens that we are. Maybe he didn't realize that wheme had been posting earlier, maybe he has some other explanation; he hasn't commented since it. <br><br>To be completely honest, it's actually grating on my nerves to defend his point. I agree with you that cooldog's point here is absolutely terrible. But I see it more strongly as bad play than as scummy play. I completely see the train of thought and I don't fault you for scumreading him for it even if you are wrong. I've just seen too many players saying stupid things as town to think that it's as heavily scum-indicative as you're saying you think it is."}

As soon as he gets that vote, CD tips his hand and lets everyone know he's going to falsely accuse WhemeStar of only posting when voted. <br><br>Pretty sure there was a 3rd lie but can't remember without going back, but those 2 are more than enough to confirm to me that he isn't town.

I agree. Don't. I disagree. They do. Townies do play badly. Lynching players for playing badly is not how you win games as town! I agree that general quality of play as a whole is lower than ideal but the way to solve that isn't by policy lynching, it's by teaching people to play better and learning to see things from others' perspectives (the latter of which you are very clearly indicating an inability to do).<br><br>You might not think that it's a policy lynch but from what I can tell you're implying that the rest of us should treat it like one even if we disagree with your reasoning on why it's scummy."}

When a person says things that aren't true, that's a lie. <br><br>He reacted poorly to the whole fake claim. Multiple people said it was a joke he said he doesn't have a sense of humor. So I search his posts and find multiple games where he makes jokes in games. For example he accuses somebody of being mafia cause they were 3rd to vote. Then said it was a joke. <br><br>Clearly he gets jokes, so he should have picked up on the fake claim joke. Which means his reaction WAS over the top and imo fake. <br><br>That's a deliberate attempt to mislead us into thinking something that just isn't true. <br><br>He also claimed WhemeStar only posts when voted, despite having posted multiple times in the game thread, even 2 hours before the first vote on him. As soon as he gets that vote, CD tips his hand and lets everyone know he's going to falsely accuse WhemeStar of only posting when voted. <br><br>Pretty sure there was a 3rd lie but can't remember without going back, but those 2 are more than enough to confirm to me that he isn't town.  He can't be.

Like, don't get me wrong, if I were to list off things scum might say in that scenario, IAWS's post would probably not make a top 5 list or anything, but it also would very definitely not make a top 5 list of things town would say.

As soon as he gets that vote, CD tips his hand and lets everyone know he's going to falsely accuse WhemeStar of only posting when voted. <br><br>Pretty sure there was a 3rd lie but can't remember without going back, but those 2 are more than enough to confirm to me that he isn't town.

Which is an awful argument in general, but is also bad because i don't know anything of iaws's play and they're new on the site.<br><br>This doesn't stop me from still having a visceral reaction to it of \"scum wouldn't say this\", though.</div></blockquote><br>From a gut feeling-ish point of view, the closest I can remember to feeling something that would make the IAWS post make sense was as scum in my first game on site.  I was a bit frustrated and bitter and felt like we'd done so well to get votes on someone and here it was falling apart because of a claim.  When people started to unvote, I was just quietly thinking <span style=\"font-style: italic\">but you just thought this guy was scum, do you really have to unvote?</span>  I certainly didn't say what IAWS said, but I think I can maybe see how someone in that same situation who thinks a bit differently than I do might wind up doing so.  Like, don't get me wrong, if I were to list off things scum might say in that scenario, IAWS's post would probably not make a top 5 list or anything, but it also would very definitely not make a top 5 list of things town would say.  I have to run so I don't have time to say much more about this, but I would really like to use the term <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Bayes' Theorem</span> so I'm gonna do that okay bye</div></blockquote><br><br>This is acting like I'm completely new to mafia, which I'm not, though in your defense you didn't know that. I've been playing mafia on other websites for like 5 years now and I do know what I'm doing (I might suck though).

I think it's much more likely he's the CD cw."}

I could go on and quote every single time that he mentioned the word \"lie\", but he has 25 instances in his ISO alone and ain't nobody got time for that.<br><br>TwoFace, you say that you weren't pushing a Lynch all Liars case. But your whole explanation for why you felt CD's reaction was disingenuous was because he said that he doesn't have a sense of humor. You said that he has made jokes in previous games, but I searched through his posts and found nothing to corroborate this claim... Whatever. Your whole Day 1 was spent tunneling one person for an alleged slip and then using confirmation bias to continue pushing your agenda on him. Any other wagon yesterday was obviously crap according to you, and then you end Day 1 by stating that I am obvscum no matter what CooLDoG's flip turned out to be and implying that tomorrow was going to be spent discussing \"why I am scum\". You can pressure your scumreads, but tunneling and ignoring the rest of the game is anti-town.<br><br>Okay I've spent way too much time on TF at this point.

He later says that his reason for voting CD early was because CD getting to type a \"wall\" early gave him town points, as if that would somehow clear him from having to produce content later in the game (\"it also excuses him from having to take actual stances\" was his exact wording).

His posts <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9015814#p9015814\" class=\"postlink\">139</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9030710#p9030710\" class=\"postlink\">325</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9031250#p9031250\" class=\"postlink\">344</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9033472#p9033472\" class=\"postlink\">370</a>, etc., seem to contradict that. I could go on and quote every single time that he mentioned the word \"lie\", but he has 25 instances in his ISO alone and ain't nobody got time for that.<br><br>TwoFace, you say that you weren't pushing a Lynch all Liars case. But your whole explanation for why you felt CD's reaction was disingenuous was because he said that he doesn't have a sense of humor. You said that he has made jokes in previous games, but I searched through his posts and found nothing to corroborate this claim... Whatever. Your whole Day 1 was spent tunneling one person for an alleged slip and then using confirmation bias to continue pushing your agenda on him. Any other wagon yesterday was obviously crap according to you, and then you end Day 1 by stating that I am obvscum no matter what CooLDoG's flip turned out to be and implying that tomorrow was going to be spent discussing \"why I am scum\". You can pressure your scumreads, but tunneling and ignoring the rest of the game is anti-town.<br><br>Okay I've spent way too much time on TF at this point. My mental health needs a break.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Eddie Cane</span></span><br>Eddie jumped on the CD wagon in post <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9013086#p9013086\" class=\"postlink\">105</a> without explanation. He states that <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9013469#p9013469\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> CD post was \"bad\" in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9014438#p9014438\" class=\"postlink\">124</a> without further explanation. He later says that his reason for voting CD early was because CD getting to type a \"wall\" early gave him town points, as if that would somehow clear him from having to produce content later in the game (\"it also excuses him from having to take actual stances\" was his exact wording). I don't buy it.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9033469#p9033469\" class=\"postlink\">Post 369</a>, Eddie Cane wrote:</cite>sometimes people deserve being mislynched. take momo or even wheme honestly. if you're going to play a trolly low effort game and you get lynched that's on you.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9039598#p9039598\" class=\"postlink\">Post 426</a>, Eddie Cane wrote:</cite>horror is basically advocating a pl which I'd adamantly disagree with</div></blockquote><br>This is a direct contradiction.

I think it was town that  he went right after bad votes on his wagon. I don't really mind kops vote (neutral on it) but that's not the point. also,  824 is pretty towny, it is the exact kind of thing is expect newb town to do because on the surface it is indeed a very bad explanation.  more importantly, he was smart enough to call it terrible and /not/ vote wheme which is very important.<br><br>lots of small things but I haven't seen scum motivation in any of hid posts and he hasn't pinged me a single time iirc, he was a bad wagon d1 and hes a bad wagon now if he becomes one. people like to vote newbs when newbs have  completrly different tells than experienced players."}

Here's my current view of the game:<br><br>horrordude is town because his play late yesterday doesn't make very much sense as scum, his entrance today is very consistent with town-who-didn't-have-time-yesterday moreso than scum, the way he's interacting with twoface looks really genuine and the reasons for voting him are crap. Yes, he didn't do very much yesterday; yes, he didn't persuade you to hop of cooldog well; these are not alignment indicative.<br><br>IAWS is probably town. I agree with eddie about the way he talked about claiming sounding more town than scum.<br><br>TwoFace is town. I don't remember my specific reason for this at the moment but i had a reason when i was looking at things at work and iirc it was pretty good.<br><br>DeathRowKitty is probably town. This is more of a gut feel thing than anything in particular; her play feels much more like what I remember of her town play. Or at least, the way she's interacting with the game is more reminiscent of how she plays as town.<br><br>Wheme is still locktown.<br><br>Desully is still likely town, though this read needs some work.<br><br>Eddie also needs re-evaluation but i still think most of what he's saying pings me as town.<br><br>That leaves Kop, fitz, and hans. Of these, Kop is a great scum candidate right now because i had vague scummy vibes from cmm that i always wanted to investigate more but never got the chance to and the one thing he talked significantly about yesterday was the prospect of leading the fruit vendor which is a very easy thing for scum to make noise about in either direction and is kind of a crappy reason to scumread someone imo. fitz effectively made one post yesterday, called wheme scum and cooldog town, hasn't had any meaningful interactions really, needs to engage more. Hans is also a great scum candidate both because of lingering things from yesterday and because the boon kill points in his direction. <br><br>I'd like to engage more directly with fitz and kop and hans and hear what their take on the current game state is seeing as none have posted yet today."}

I didn't pressure Eddie because I hadn't even really looked to the other players on the wagon. As I've stated several times, I wasn't focusing on the game in general until after the game went to night. Yes, this makes me look terrible, and I fully accept this fact.

Why IAWS instead of any other 4 people on your wagon at that point? Especially when you had <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9029959#p9029959\" class=\"postlink\">previously</a> stated that the 3 votes on you at the time were horrible?<br>- Post <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9034956#p9034956\" class=\"postlink\">403</a> he scumreads the people on his wagon except myself and Hans. I started the wagon, and Hans jumped on it blindly with no justification, so I'm more than a little confused why he wasn't scumreading the two of us as well at the time.<br>- He claims he gave his fruit to TF because TF <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9066803#p9066803\" class=\"postlink\">is going to be town leader</a>.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_facepalm.gif\" alt=\":facepalm:\" title=\"Face, Meet Palm\"> <br>- His vote on fitz in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9068490#p9068490\" class=\"postlink\">871</a> looks like a blatant OMGUS.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Fitz</span></span><br>- Fitz hasn't done much this game save a few catchup walls.

I rarely look at other games for meta details but did so here because I was perceiving him as a detriment to the scum team and I wanted to see if there were areas I could help him with.

Drk is a competent player; she isn't going to have left a very overt message just to communicate her traitorness.

I have no idea why twoface thinks scum-hans-slot wouldn't kill two people in a row that suspected him, especially when hans would have made the first kill and oneironaut would have made the second (meaning there might not have been a train of thought there). But basically oneironaut-scum getting lynched today is probably game over for the scum, because they're left with 1 alive going into 7p with 2 mislynches, they haven't managed to kill a single power role (and they're clearly assuming that there's a protective role out there since IAWS is alive and blocked), and the existence of wheme and IAWS as basically un-mislynchable slots complicates things beyond all that. <br><br>Beyond that, onei's posting isn't particularly stellar either. His one action so far was to criticize fitz for buddying him. He's attacking fitz for posting walls, which is entirely stylistic and a very easy point to get into the ground and look like you're starting to contribute to the game. He accuses fitz of buddying but doesn't really explain why townreading his slot is in and of itself a scummy thing to do; he merely says that he wouldn't if he didn't know that he was town. A bunch of his specific points are really, really reaching to the point where I find it difficult to believe that a townie could believe them to be true (DRK used small text in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9008273#p9008273\">25</a>, where it was clearly there, therefore DRK was trying to obfuscate/communicate to scumbuddies? fitz sought clarification on the lover claim... therefore he was fishing???)<br><br>The latter of those points in particular looks like scum making shit up to fit the narrative that they're pushing. It's also probably not a bus (I don't think scum would be particularly likely to bus in this particular situation), which means it's probably not onei+fitz.<br><br>Beyond all this I have a theory on DRK's play this game which is that part of the reason she was so apathetic was that she didn't like her scumteam or thought that they wouldn't be able to win. I say this because it fits with hans-scum, because DRK clearly didn't think hans was competent. It would also fit with kop/cmm-scum."}

It must be a frame on whoever their scumreads were.\"<br><br>This just isn't how things work in practice. <br><br>Scum don't kill to frame as a first instinct; this is ESPECIALLY true in a meta where people are looking less and less at nightkills. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=68600\" class=\"postlink\">This game</a> is sort of my go-to anecdote; scum killed MariaR n1 even though she wasn't a particularly noteworthy poster in terms of content or sway on the game. Her reads were really good. And yet peoples' <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8424637#p8424637\" class=\"postlink\">first instinct</a> was \"it must have been a frame\" (shadow_step was town, I was town, boring was scum who Maria was pushing, and this was particularly frustrating to me because I spent the whole game tunneling boring). <br><br>Your first thought when you see scum kill two people whose first suspect was the same person, and when that person has done nothing that looks especially town on their own, should not be \"oh it must be a frame.\"<br><br>Scum kill people who are active and obviously town, or people who they think are power roles, or people who have good reads. Killing people who have good reads wins games. Scum may be framing people in the former two cases but scum rarely kill with the main intention of framing unless the scum themselves are near-universally townread."}

My inclination to townread his recent responses is mostly a result of the tone that he's taken with twoface and iaws and in general. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9083620#p9083620\">1207</a> doesn't feel like a scum reaction; that's largely gut though. The description in his next two posts of twoface's play isn't something I'd expect from scum as much as from town; the attitude in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9083651#p9083651\">1209</a> is not something that I particularly expect scum to fake because it doesn't really make him look good on the surface, it just creates more animosity between him and twoface and further cements twoface's tunnel on him (this is assuming twoface is town which i'm willing to do here).<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9083838#p9083838\">1218</a> is not the way you claim or softclaim as survivalistic scum. <br><br>Essentially, the way he's taking the moral high ground here looks genuine to me. I don't think he's faking the frustration over twoface's play; I think it'd be much more expedient as scum to take a softer stance, try to placate twoface and get him to tunnel elsewhere, etc. I don't think fitz would give up in the way that he is, in a sense. He isn't really actually giving up but he's given up on saying anything to twoface, and the way that he's doing it looks to me like town who is frustrated rather than caught scum. Things like the point-by-point refutation in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9084552#p9084552\">1251</a> cement this because I think fitz as scum doesn't have a good reason to spend so much effort berating twoface over every little point because it doesn't actually accomplish anything for him and he'd just be acting facetiously because he'd know tf was right. On the other hand fitz as town does have reason to make that refutation because he'd be rightly angry over twoface's tunnel. Townies don't always just do everything with the #1 priority of winning the game; lots of actions are motivated by emotion, and in this case it seems more consistent to me that his actions come from town."}

So null action by DRK.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9029598#p9029598\">Post 293</a>...another harmless vote (this time on TwoFace) but for some reason this feel more genuine than the Hans vote.  So town points to TwoFace.  Also says she hates everyone in the game but imp and Desully.  All the imp stuff is bothersome.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9034550#p9034550\">Post 390</a>...smh at DRL imp lovefest.  Either imp is scum or DRK is really trying to f him over by association.

Votes IAWS....probably means IAWS is town.<br><br>As an aside...do we have any way of knowing whether DRK was brought into the scum fold N1?  If she was successful in getting her message across that would have effected her pre-guilty posting D2 IMO.  If not recruited DRK would be frustrated and trying to get a message across to scum.  If successfully recruited...she would be idgaf mode and just playing like normal scum.<br><br>I think DRK was recruited.  Not seeing any D2 incriminating content.  Has an exchange/debate with Eddie but nothing AI toward Eddie IMO.  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9072935#p9072935\">WIFOM's a Wheme reference</a> on the way out the door.<br><br>That's all for DRK.<br><br>I really think the imp stuff has merit.  The other two players I think could be linked negatively to DRK are CMM/Kop and Eddie.  Looking back at the \"speak of the devil\" comment by Eddie it really had no reason for being made.  He's dropping a vote on town in response to DRK's request to get off the CMM wagon.  Could def be some signaling here.<br><br>Eddie next....then probably imp."}

It's possible I have made mistakes in this game but there is nothing I have said out of deceit.<br><br>As for you believing me...if you are town as I suspect...you have been in enough games with me to know how I play and the crap you are psuhing on me is NAI for me.  And this exchange happens in every one of them.  If you can't see that that's on you.<br><br>As for apologizing for casting shade on your ability to play...from my perspective and experience with you there is no reason to.  If I'm today's lynch you'll have 2 mislynches on your hands.  Just look at the last game we finished.  iirc you push the D1 mislynch and then tunneled on me all of D2..while I fought to prevent the eventual mislynch and get people to vote with me (on scum).  Then you push me again D3 and while not on my wagon at the end...are in lart part responsible for my eventual mislynch and town losing.  A game I would point out that when I replaced in my top three scumreads were the scumteam.<br><br>So there is nothing wrong with my game and I have nothing I feel requires an apology.<br><br>I'm around all day.  My only other game is not taking any of my time atm.  If you want me to answer anything ask away.<br><br>P.edit....just seeing the 3 or 4 newer posts."}

See what he finds so \u201csubstantial.\u201d<br> <br>One\u2019s first dig at me is that I was <span class=\"noboldsig\">townreading his predecessor</span>.  Which he found hard to believe because <span class=\"noboldsig\">Amish Tell</span>.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\">    Also...I don't recall ever saying it was \"Strong\".  That's a bit of exaggeration iirc.<br> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">So One</span>...IF you are actually town...why would the first person you choose to focus on in the game be the lone person, iirc, in the game who is not scum reading you?  Virtually everybody in the game wants you lynched except me...so I'm scum.  Gawd this game is frustrating.  First off...I'm not \"whiteknighting\" anything because I'm not defending your slot.  Saying I have a gut meta town read on Hans is not whiteknighting.  If others want to lynch you....more power to them.  If you want to call it buddying...I guess the same could be said of anyone town reading you.  Which as I said before...I think is no one.<br> <br>As for basing a read on pure meta...as TwoFace has shown in this game....not everyone plays with the same mindset.  You don't like meta?  Fine.  I'm not a big advocate of it myself...but I do trust my gut and my gut was telling me Hans was town based on the short time he was here.  If you are town and find that so foreign then I don't know what else to say.<br> <br>As for finding <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9078917#p9078917\"><span class='\\\"noboldsig\\\"'>my comments on Boon strange</span></a>...I wrote that catch up prior to the night resolving and I didn't edit him out.  Similar to my my catch up to N3 that had Stone Cold in them.  No reason to edit them out.  It let's people know what I was thinking about whatever it was I commented on\u2026whether they like it or not.<br> <br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9080406#p9080406\">Next post</a>....in addition to the <span class=\"noboldsig\">\"buddying\"</span>....you suspect me for <span class=\"noboldsig\">posting filler.</span>  If by filler you mean content that isn't saying anything I would argue that is for the most part not true.  Everyone makes posts that aren't explicitly aimed at scum hunting but otherwise I think much of my content has been towards finding scum or exhanges with other players.  It might also just be a playstyle thing.  I don't feel I've been posting any differently in this game then in any other town games I have.<br> <br>Fishing\u2026.in reference to asking Boon and/or Eddie about the lover claim.  I don\u2019t see how discussing a role that had already been claimed in the game is fishing.  In fact\u2026by the time I asked about it we already had one player (CD) sentenced to hang for being upset about it being claimed (<span style=\"font-style: italic\">good work there Eddie\u2026nice pro-scum gambit that turned out to be</span>).  So to accuse me of fishing for something that was a large topic of discussion is not accurate.  You can\u2019t fish if the fish is already out of the water. <br> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Linking to posts in my catch ups.</span>  Seriously?  This is the stupidest reason of them all.  I post primarily from my phone and it is too difficult for my catch ups to do a lot of quoting.  It\u2019s much easier to link to whatever posts caught my eye and provide comment if necessary.  Apologies if this is too much work for you to read but it\u2019s how I catch up.  And anyone in here that has played with me before can most likely confirm.  I know TwoFace can because he bitches about them all the time.<br> <br>You go on in a <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9005915#p9005915\">later post</a> to list my first 4 votes and label them.  Not sure how this shows suspicion but lets review.<br>1st vote on horror you call RVS and you would be correct.  NAI I assume?<br>2nd vote on CooLDoG you call naked (it was) because \u201cit was the wagon to be on at the time\u201d.  Actually\u2026the trending wagon at this point was DRK with 2 votes.  CMM also had two votes.  So I could have brought either of them to a 3rd vote too.  I wasn\u2019t on CD long but the time I was there was just to pressure him and try to get a better read on him.    I got off his wagon before anyone else voted himwhen another player drew my suspicions.<br>3rd and 4th votes\u2026.not sure how putting a vote down within a wall post is suspect.  Especially when some degree of reason was given for both in addition to much other content (non filler) in the wallposts.<br> <br>So in summary\u2026if I am correct\u2026your \u201csubstantial scum read on me is due to:<br> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">townreading your predecessor</span>.  aka <span class=\"noboldsig\">\"buddying\"</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">my post-mortem leftover comments on Boon and Stone Cold</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">posting filler</span> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Linking to posts in my catch ups.</span> annnnd maybe because you didn\u2019t like the way I voted people I suspected?  smh\u2026<br> <br>That\u2019s a massive heap of shit for a case with the last 3-4 points being completely based on formatting playstyle.  Which is completely NAI.  If you want to stand your ground because you don\u2019t like the fact your predecessor was being town read from me for gut based on a previous game (loosely aka meta) then I can not defend that opinion.  But it\u2019s a weak one at that when you, if town, should be more concerned with the people who are finding you scummy.  Because that fits scum\u2019s agenda if you are town\u2026while me town reading Hans, and by continuation you, does not"}

I haven't specifically said I'm scum reading Fitz, but he's in my lynch pool along with you, and One. But he's the last person I'd look at right now, because of the doubts I have of there being scum within the neighbourhood. You've looked on the wiki page of the role, and seen that most instances there could be scum in the neighbourhood, and you've ran with that idea that there is definite scum in there. <br><br>Now I'm thinking outside of the box, and just think that the neighbourhood has been put in to create confusion, and that it could actually be full of all town.

So many things wrong with this post.<br>1) How out-of-touch are you with the gamestate that you think scum might not be able to get you lynched? You're at L-2 and literally the only person who called you town as far as I can remember was fitz and he's dead.<br>2) Why are you softclaiming something that scum would want to kill...? What benefit is there to that? At all? Are you trying to WIFOM scum? As the person perceived as by far the scummiest? How does this make any sense at all?<br>3) Why are you softclaiming...... at all??? What benefit is there to randomly softclaiming your role? Why softclaim and not hardclaim? Either you realize you're almost definitely the lynch (in which case, you have no reason not to just outright hardclaim) or you don't (in which case...)<br>4) Why are you claiming in any way at all? Your rhetoric makes it clear that you don't realize you're by far the most likely lynch target today, which makes me think that you're not claiming in response to pressure."}

If others are going by the theory that there is scum in the neighbours, fitz is gone and flipped town, that leaves twoface, because there is no possible way that IAWS is going to flip red. <br><br>Then there is the other doubt that I have in my mind, is the fact that Twoface has played such a strong game, and is actively scum hunting, this is WIFOM but it worries me that he is still alive. I understand the fact that scum would ideally like to have killed IAWS but with a roleblocker they would go elsewhere, and where would I go? I'd go after the biggest voice in the town, and that's Twoface. It will be ballsy for a doctor to doctor elsewhere and leaving a cop unprotected, on the off chance that scum would actually go for the cop based on that. (Based on a doctor being in the game of course.)<br><br>I don't know, I don't know anymore. I didn't fully expect fitz to actually flip town, but he was my third shout for scum. Behind Wheme and one, but there's doubts running into my head now, I just can't expect the expected anymore. I've just seen it many times where someone plays such vocal manner like twoface and thought there's no way he/she can be scum, then end game, they were scum, I feel like I'm in dejavu again."}

Answer and explain your reasoning</div></blockquote><br>Wow, not a leading question at all!<br><br>First, no, I would not say that this is a specific enough action to be alignment-indicative on its own. That's an extremely general action. There are tons of different ways to lie.<br><br>To answer the question that you're obviously intending to ask, I don't think cooldog has lied. If i'm reading correctly the lies are:<br>1) the thinking the claim was real, which I've argued about extensively and pointed out that havingfitz <span style=\"font-style: italic\">also thought it was real.</span> Did fitz lie too? Are they both scum for that?<br>2) the \"premeditated\" thing, where he says to wait for the vote-prodded response, then accuses wheme of only posting when prodded by votes. This is a much better point than point 1 actually, I'd say it's worth some amount of scumpoints for cooldog, but over my years on this site I have discovered and accounted for what was probably my largest bias: thinking that logic is indicative of town. It isn't, and the reverse holds as well: incorrect logic is not indicative of scum.<br><br>It's possible that cooldog set that up to try to make wheme look facetiously scummy, but (a) that's not a particularly strong way of getting others to agree with you because we'll obviously see through it and (b) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">it doesn't exactly take a lot to paint wheme as scummy</span>. Wheme is a player who naturally obscures his opinions and it's very easy to push a case on him; there's no need for scum-cooldog to go out of his way like this. It's still possible and so he gets some amount of scum points for that, but it's perfectly possible as well that he is simply perceiving the game through a different lens that we are. Maybe he didn't realize that wheme had been posting earlier, maybe he has some other explanation; he hasn't commented since it. <br><br>To be completely honest, it's actually grating on my nerves to defend his point. I agree with you that cooldog's point here is absolutely terrible. But I see it more strongly as bad play than as scummy play. I completely see the train of thought and I don't fault you for scumreading him for it even if you are wrong. I've just seen too many players saying stupid things as town to think that it's as heavily scum-indicative as you're saying you think it is.</div></blockquote><br><br><br>Too many words to say scummy play is okay.

It's disrespectful to all the players who have been reading you for days and days, it's disrespectful to the mod who's working their ass off to keep the game running and it's ultimately a sign of immaturity. <br><br>Now, can we please scumhunt for real?

Why does scum kill boon then stone cold? As I've said, this point is more valid from my own point of view, because Stone Cold was pseudo tunneling myself along with superhans, but that doesn't apply to the boon kill. I really think scum don't make both of those kills if oneironaut is scum; neither of those slots showed any indication that they were slowing down in their pressure on superhans, and i think in practice in today's meta scum don't generally kill just to frame. They kill players who are active and/or who have good reads, or occasionally PR reads. Killing Stone Cold in particular I think makes almost no sense fmpov if hans was town; why kill a slot that's being active enough that I highly doubt it was a PR read, that was strongly pushing two town slots as its primary suspects? Makes no sense at all. But again, that point relies on me being town, so it's not as useful from others' point of view unless they have a townread on me.<br><br>Number two is the claim. I feel like I shouldn't need to spell this out so plainly in a game where people (read: twoface and eddie) have been tunneling left and right based on \"lies\" that were meaningless. But this is not a meaningless lie. There is absolutely NO town motivation for softclaiming a power role in the situation oneironaut was in as a vanilla townie. Zero. It is only explainable as flatly terrible play, more terrible than I think I'm willing to accept as being even vaguely likely. Oneironaut was under a TON of pressure. If he's town, he knows he's going to get grilled after softclaiming. Almost certainly, he thought that he was going down and was looking for some out, any out, and so he softclaimed in the hopes that people would buy it. NM then claimed vt because he didn't know that his slot had softclaimed earlier. <br><br>Number three, superhans was a scummy slot. I think like everyone agrees on this so I'm not going to ISO him again.<br><br>Number four, oneironaut's play was scummy. I criticized his early posting (and made the NK argument that I just rehashed) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9081878#p9081878\">here</a>. After that, he starts an <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9091933#p9091933\">entirely semantic</a> argument with twoface, an extremely easy avenue to take as scum, because it's an argument that lets you be correct in a meaningless (non-alignment-indicative) way. Actually a lot of the rest of his iso pings slightly town or mostly null to me (the way he talks to twoface late). But I think the negatives somewhat outweigh the positives."}

I will scrutinize you personally when I can in the next couple days. But I just want Titus to realize that eliminating you as a suspect entirely still endangers the town.

This works because the remaining scum is an even-night rb, and tonight is an odd night. If Titus saves someone tonight, obviously we lynch tomorrow because we'll be in odds. If we mislynch today and Titus (or anyone else) dies, then we'll be at 4p and we no-lynch tomorrow since there's technically no one alive who's formally clear.<br><br>My scum pool right now is basically math and hiraki, and I lean pretty heavily towards math. A quick look at Eddie's ISO ctrl+f'ing hans's name looks pretty bad as well. He *consistently* has hans as the \"next person to lynch.\" On d1, he says he thinks cd and hans are both scum but <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9057827#p9057827\">is more confident</a> in a cd flip. Before the DRK lynch he waffles around voting hans and eventually does vote him, calling him <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9072497#p9072497\">the second scum</a> after DRK while DRK is getting wagoned. However, early in d3, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9081543#p9081543\">his reads suddenly change</a> with the theory that DRK's scumflip implicated me, and he suddenly conveniently has someone else to push over hans now that the scumteam's traitor is dead. Later that day, hans is once again placed behind someone else, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9088245#p9088245\">this time fitz.</a><br><br>Point is: he constantly, constantly talks about how he finds hans scummy. And yet, his pressure on that slot never ever amounts to anything; his one vote on the slot is essentially a kneejerk reaction to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9071498#p9071498\">920</a>, and never really contributes any meaningful pressure. The rest of the time, he always manages to find someone else to vote for or to push as the better lynch while being able to very effectively distance from hans.<br><br>Disclaimer is that this post actually might be confbias; i am interested in hearing other opinions on this. But I really think this looks like scum distancing. I feel like town at least meaningfully votes hans at some point during all of this. It's like eddie saw twoface as this big town personality who was wrong about everything, and basically took the opportunity to loudly sheep all of twoface's opinions so that he could effectively distance from his scumbuddy while coordinating with the townie who was wrong about things.<br><br>Will probably look deeper at Kop ISO next."}

This works because the remaining scum is an even-night rb, and tonight is an odd night. If Titus saves someone tonight, obviously we lynch tomorrow because we'll be in odds. If we mislynch today and Titus (or anyone else) dies, then we'll be at 4p and we no-lynch tomorrow since there's technically no one alive who's formally clear.</div></blockquote><br>You have the endgame wrong. I don't know if you are mistaken or if you are trying to confuse either scum or town with it, but I'm going to clarify it. <br><br>First, unless I'm very much misinformed, WhemeStar is confirmed town. Unless you're telling me that scum have a player who is both an Even-Night Roleblocker and a Full-Time Fruit Vendor and can also perform the night kill.<br><br>Second, scum have literally zero incentive to kill anyone but Titus. This is because targeting WhemeStar leaves the chance of him being protected and leaving the two remaining VTs together alive creates a bigger smokescreen for the scum.<br><br>Third, your very premise of us leaving somebody alive tomorrow is flawed, because since WhemeStar is conftown (unless I've misunderstood something), he'll be the next target. That means we have to lynch scum either today or tomorrow to win. There is no way around it unless we abstain from voting today and tomorrow, but that's just going to result in the same scenario, only with less conftown on the board.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9180844#p9180844\" class=\"postlink\">post 2522</a>, implosion wrote:</cite>My scum pool right now is basically math and hiraki, and I lean pretty heavily towards math.

This is one of those cases; i'm willing to write titus and wheme off as town at this point without reading a single post that they've posted. I do independently have a strong townread on wheme and a weak townread on titus's predecessor (i haven't actually made any material effort to read into titus's alignment since massclaim). Point is, in many cases, setup spec is more reliable because it can't be faked. Any towntell can be faked, any scumtell can be you misreading into something. With setup spec in some cases, the only way you can get it wrong is by doing the math wrong, and in some cases the math is obvious enough that you really can't get it wrong. IMO, this is one of those cases, where the setup is so overwhelmingly scumsided if we don't have a doctor that it's absurd that it would pass review.<br><br>Comparing it to the only other mini normal that I can think of that had a traitor, it had a setup of (goon + goon + bp traitor) vs (gunsmith + 3-shot jailkeeper + 1-shot vig + townies); gunsmith is comparable but a bit weaker than cop, 3-shot jk is comparable to doctor, 1-shot vig is stronger than fruit vendor (it confirms itself as not mafia and also gets a kill and possibly an extra mislynch in in conjunction with the jailkeeper) AND the mafia don't have any roleblocker (which is IMO stronger than making the traitor bulletproof). So that setup is comparable to or a bit more townsided than this setup if Titus is telling the truth, and MASSIVELY more townsided than this if Titus is lying. And that setup was STILL called scumsided in postgame. And most importantly, discussion of mini normal balance on MS since then has erred on the side of making things more townsided.<br><br>Anyway this is just a thing that's easy for me to rant about.
