All normal site rules apply.<br>\n2. You may not talk about this game outside of this thread or any Private Threads created for this game.<br>\n3. Please remain civil with each other. Things can get heated or intense, but there are several things that will NOT be tolerated. Absolutely no offensive comments or slurs based on race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc. I WILL force replace you.<br>\n4. This is my color. There are many like it, but this one is mine. Do not use this color or any color too close to it.<br>\n5. Do not quote or pretend to quote any role PM, anything from a private thread, or mod communication. You can loosely paraphrase, but please use common sense.<br>\n6. Pretending to break a rule can result in the same action being taken as actually breaking the rule.<br>\n7. Do not try to manipulate or trick the mod.<br>\n8. Any minor/simple questions or pointing out errors in vote counts can be pointed out in thread by leading with a bolded @MOD at the start of a line.<br>\n9. Any more sensitive questions can be PM'd to me. Don't hesitate to ask if you have a question, you will not bother me.<br>\n10. If your spot in the game has been compromised due to outside information, please PM me immediately without making any more posts. I will be eternally grateful for your honesty.<br>\n11. I am not perfect. If you notice anything that is incorrect, let me know.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Voting</div></div><br>\n<br>\n1. Voting must be made using the vote tags <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Shaziro</span> or using bold. I greatly prefer the vote tags though.<br>\n2. Any other variation will not be counted. I will let you know in thread once (if I notice it), but only once.<br>\n3. Misspellings, acronyms, and abbreviations will be valid as long as it is clear who you are voting for. If I perceive it as a vote, it is a vote.<br>\n4. Any votes within spoiler tags or otherwise concealed will not be counted.<br>\n5. A lynch will occur when 50%+1 (rounded down) of the votes are cast for the same player; a No Lynch will occur when 50%+1 (rounded down) of the votes are cast for that option or when there is not 50%+1 (rounded down) majority by deadline. When this has happened, any subsequent votes and unvotes will not be counted, and the game will enter twilight.<br>\n6. You may continue talking after a lynch or deadline has elapsed until the mod posts to end the day. After that, you may not post even if the mod forgets to lock the thread.<br>\n7. I will try to provide vote counts on a regular basis, with exception to the times when I am at class (which varies but is typically done before 4pm EST). You may request a new vote count at any time, and I will post it at my earliest convenience.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Activity/Day Night</div></div><br>\n<br>\n1. Days will last two weeks. Deadline extensions will be granted only for the case of replacements, holidays, or other extreme circumstances.<br>\n2. Night phases will last for 2 days (48 hours)<br>\n3. Replacement during night phase will extend the deadline to 24 hours past the point of the replacement, whether that slot has a night action or not.<br>\n4. Actions must be PM'd to me or bolded in the Scum PT for it to be accepted. If no action is selected, they will not perform an action.<br>\n5. If mafia have powers other than their factional night kill, they may perform their power and the kill at the same time.<br>\n6. Prods will be sent out after 48 hours of inactivity. These will be announced in thread. At player request (if reasonable), I can \"Poke\" another player. This will not count as a prod.<br>\n7. If a player does not respond IN THREAD within 24 hours or receives 3 prods, they will be replaced out. If they return before a replacement is found, they may keep playing. The next time they are prodded, however, they will be replaced and can not return.<br>\n8. If you will be unable to be active in thread for over 48 hours, please make a V/LA post in bold. As long as the time is reasonable, you will be exempt from prods.<br>\n9. Once you are dead, you may no longer post in thread. No \"bah\" posts.<br>\n<br>\nMafia Team has Daytalk enabled in this game.<br>\n<br>\nIf you have any questions over your role or any of the rules in the game, feel free to PM me, you won't bother me!</div><br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: CooLDoG's Role PM</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">You are a Vanilla Townie.<br>\n<br>\nYour powers include your voice and your vote!

It feels like scum who has latched on to what they believe is an easy-to-justify tunnel. It seems like essentially every single thing that cooldog posts, he finds some scum motivation for. That doesn't look to me like a townie who is objectively trying to evaluate individual posts for which alignment they're indicative of; it looks like scum who thinks that they have found someone that they can list good logical reasons for voting, and so has decided to latch onto the read and push it because they know that they'll be able to look accurately logical in pushing it.<br>\n<br>\nIt conceivably could be town tunneling really badly but cooldog in particular in this game is, IMO, the kind of \"easy mislynch\" that is very attractive to scum (assuming that I'm right that he's town, which is of course not a given, but bear with me). Cooldog has posted a lot of very at-face-value jarring things, like calling out the claim early and criticizing the cmm wagon that he was on. These things are, IMO, really not alignment-indicative when you look past the surface of them (in the former case, as I've argued, scum empirically don't lie about things like thinking that a claim like that is a real claim, and this is further supported by fitz's thinking that it might have been real; in the latter case, his cmm vote was purely rvs while at least mine wasn't).<br>\n<br>\nIt's also not alignment-indicative but I absolutely despise this attitude:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Twoface wrote:</cite>everyone says that, yet I never have a crazy reaction when people I think are scum flip. most of the time I am right and when I am wrong, i don't really care because it was them that played like scum, so they deserved it.</div></blockquote>\nSaying that everyone you vote for deserved it is a surefire way to never improving your ability to read people. A mislynch is everyone's fault in different proportions that can never really be objectively evaluated.

Answer and explain your reasoning</div></blockquote>\nWow, not a leading question at all!<br>\n<br>\nFirst, no, I would not say that this is a specific enough action to be alignment-indicative on its own. That's an extremely general action. There are tons of different ways to lie.<br>\n<br>\nTo answer the question that you're obviously intending to ask, I don't think cooldog has lied. If i'm reading correctly the lies are:<br>\n1) the thinking the claim was real, which I've argued about extensively and pointed out that havingfitz <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">also thought it was real.</div> Did fitz lie too? Are they both scum for that?<br>\n2) the \"premeditated\" thing, where he says to wait for the vote-prodded response, then accuses wheme of only posting when prodded by votes. This is a much better point than point 1 actually, I'd say it's worth some amount of scumpoints for cooldog, but over my years on this site I have discovered and accounted for what was probably my largest bias: thinking that logic is indicative of town. It isn't, and the reverse holds as well: incorrect logic is not indicative of scum.<br>\n<br>\nIt's possible that cooldog set that up to try to make wheme look facetiously scummy, but (a) that's not a particularly strong way of getting others to agree with you because we'll obviously see through it and (b) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">it doesn't exactly take a lot to paint wheme as scummy</div>. Wheme is a player who naturally obscures his opinions and it's very easy to push a case on him; there's no need for scum-cooldog to go out of his way like this. It's still possible and so he gets some amount of scum points for that, but it's perfectly possible as well that he is simply perceiving the game through a different lens that we are. Maybe he didn't realize that wheme had been posting earlier, maybe he has some other explanation; he hasn't commented since it. <br>\n<br>\nTo be completely honest, it's actually grating on my nerves to defend his point. I agree with you that cooldog's point here is absolutely terrible. But I see it more strongly as bad play than as scummy play. I completely see the train of thought and I don't fault you for scumreading him for it even if you are wrong. I've just seen too many players saying stupid things as town to think that it's as heavily scum-indicative as you're saying you think it is.", "time": "Tue Mar 28, 2017 4:27 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71119&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "71119"}

When a person says things that aren't true, that's a lie. <br>\n<br>\nHe reacted poorly to the whole fake claim. Multiple people said it was a joke he said he doesn't have a sense of humor. So I search his posts and find multiple games where he makes jokes in games. For example he accuses somebody of being mafia cause they were 3rd to vote. Then said it was a joke. <br>\n<br>\nClearly he gets jokes, so he should have picked up on the fake claim joke. Which means his reaction WAS over the top and imo fake. <br>\n<br>\nThat's a deliberate attempt to mislead us into thinking something that just isn't true. <br>\n<br>\nHe also claimed WhemeStar only posts when voted, despite having posted multiple times in the game thread, even 2 hours before the first vote on him. As soon as he gets that vote, CD tips his hand and lets everyone know he's going to falsely accuse WhemeStar of only posting when voted. <br>\n<br>\nPretty sure there was a 3rd lie but can't remember without going back, but those 2 are more than enough to confirm to me that he isn't town.

When a person says things that aren't true, that's a lie. <br>\n<br>\nHe reacted poorly to the whole fake claim. Multiple people said it was a joke he said he doesn't have a sense of humor. So I search his posts and find multiple games where he makes jokes in games. For example he accuses somebody of being mafia cause they were 3rd to vote. Then said it was a joke. <br>\n<br>\nClearly he gets jokes, so he should have picked up on the fake claim joke. Which means his reaction WAS over the top and imo fake. <br>\n<br>\nThat's a deliberate attempt to mislead us into thinking something that just isn't true. <br>\n<br>\nHe also claimed WhemeStar only posts when voted, despite having posted multiple times in the game thread, even 2 hours before the first vote on him. As soon as he gets that vote, CD tips his hand and lets everyone know he's going to falsely accuse WhemeStar of only posting when voted. <br>\n<br>\nPretty sure there was a 3rd lie but can't remember without going back, but those 2 are more than enough to confirm to me that he isn't town.

I was a bit frustrated and bitter and felt like we'd done so well to get votes on someone and here it was falling apart because of a claim.

Like, don't get me wrong, if I were to list off things scum might say in that scenario, IAWS's post would probably not make a top 5 list or anything, but it also would very definitely not make a top 5 list of things town would say.  I have to run so I don't have time to say much more about this, but I would really like to use the term <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Bayes' Theorem</div> so I'm gonna do that okay bye</div></blockquote>\n\nThis is acting like I'm completely new to mafia, which I'm not, though in your defense you didn't know that.

When a person says things that aren't true, that's a lie. <br>\n<br>\nHe reacted poorly to the whole fake claim. Multiple people said it was a joke he said he doesn't have a sense of humor. So I search his posts and find multiple games where he makes jokes in games. For example he accuses somebody of being mafia cause they were 3rd to vote. Then said it was a joke. <br>\n<br>\nClearly he gets jokes, so he should have picked up on the fake claim joke. Which means his reaction WAS over the top and imo fake. <br>\n<br>\nThat's a deliberate attempt to mislead us into thinking something that just isn't true. <br>\n<br>\nHe also claimed WhemeStar only posts when voted, despite having posted multiple times in the game thread, even 2 hours before the first vote on him. As soon as he gets that vote, CD tips his hand and lets everyone know he's going to falsely accuse WhemeStar of only posting when voted. <br>\n<br>\nPretty sure there was a 3rd lie but can't remember without going back, but those 2 are more than enough to confirm to me that he isn't town.  He can't be. Those are outright deceitful lies that should not be made by someone with a town role pm.</div></blockquote>\nThis is your case.

I was a bit frustrated and bitter and felt like we'd done so well to get votes on someone and here it was falling apart because of a claim.  When people started to unvote, I was just quietly thinking <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">but you just thought this guy was scum, do you really have to unvote?</div>  I certainly didn't say what IAWS said, but I think I can maybe see how someone in that same situation who thinks a bit differently than I do might wind up doing so.  Like, don't get me wrong, if I were to list off things scum might say in that scenario, IAWS's post would probably not make a top 5 list or anything, but it also would very definitely not make a top 5 list of things town would say.  I have to run so I don't have time to say much more about this, but I would really like to use the term <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Bayes' Theorem</div> so I'm gonna do that okay bye</div></blockquote>\n\nThis is acting like I'm completely new to mafia, which I'm not, though in your defense you didn't know that.

I also understand where my play stood Day 1, and that I don't look great from a town perspective - I wasn't giving this game the attention it fully deserved, and I look forward to being able to dedicate more time to this.<br>\n<br>\nWhat's done is done, now let's move on to the game. There is exactly 0% chance that this was an all town lynch wagon. Looking at each player on it:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">TwoFace</div></div> <br>\nI've already spent plenty of time going back and forth with TF about our separate opinions on the CooLDoG Case.

I could go on and quote every single time that he mentioned the word \"lie\", but he has 25 instances in his ISO alone and ain't nobody got time for that.<br>\n<br>\nTwoFace, you say that you weren't pushing a Lynch all Liars case. But your whole explanation for why you felt CD's reaction was disingenuous was because he said that he doesn't have a sense of humor. You said that he has made jokes in previous games, but I searched through his posts and found nothing to corroborate this claim... Whatever. Your whole Day 1 was spent tunneling one person for an alleged slip and then using confirmation bias to continue pushing your agenda on him. Any other wagon yesterday was obviously crap according to you, and then you end Day 1 by stating that I am obvscum no matter what CooLDoG's flip turned out to be and implying that tomorrow was going to be spent discussing \"why I am scum\". You can pressure your scumreads, but tunneling and ignoring the rest of the game is anti-town.<br>\n<br>\nOkay I've spent way too much time on TF at this point. My mental health needs a break.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Eddie Cane</div></div><br>\nEddie jumped on the CD wagon in post <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9013086#p9013086\" class=\"postlink\">105</a> without explanation.

He later says that his reason for voting CD early was because CD getting to type a \"wall\" early gave him town points, as if that would somehow clear him from having to produce content later in the game (\"it also excuses him from having to take actual stances\" was his exact wording).

But your whole explanation for why you felt CD's reaction was disingenuous was because he said that he doesn't have a sense of humor. You said that he has made jokes in previous games, but I searched through his posts and found nothing to corroborate this claim... Whatever. Your whole Day 1 was spent tunneling one person for an alleged slip and then using confirmation bias to continue pushing your agenda on him. Any other wagon yesterday was obviously crap according to you, and then you end Day 1 by stating that I am obvscum no matter what CooLDoG's flip turned out to be and implying that tomorrow was going to be spent discussing \"why I am scum\". You can pressure your scumreads, but tunneling and ignoring the rest of the game is anti-town.<br>\n<br>\nOkay I've spent way too much time on TF at this point.

Here's my current view of the game:<br>\n<br>\nhorrordude is town because his play late yesterday doesn't make very much sense as scum, his entrance today is very consistent with town-who-didn't-have-time-yesterday moreso than scum, the way he's interacting with twoface looks really genuine and the reasons for voting him are crap. Yes, he didn't do very much yesterday; yes, he didn't persuade you to hop of cooldog well; these are not alignment indicative.<br>\n<br>\nIAWS is probably town. I agree with eddie about the way he talked about claiming sounding more town than scum.<br>\n<br>\nTwoFace is town. I don't remember my specific reason for this at the moment but i had a reason when i was looking at things at work and iirc it was pretty good.<br>\n<br>\nDeathRowKitty is probably town.

Of these, Kop is a great scum candidate right now because i had vague scummy vibes from cmm that i always wanted to investigate more but never got the chance to and the one thing he talked significantly about yesterday was the prospect of leading the fruit vendor which is a very easy thing for scum to make noise about in either direction and is kind of a crappy reason to scumread someone imo. fitz effectively made one post yesterday, called wheme scum and cooldog town, hasn't had any meaningful interactions really, needs to engage more. Hans is also a great scum candidate both because of lingering things from yesterday and because the boon kill points in his direction. <br>\n<br>\nI'd like to engage more directly with fitz and kop and hans and hear what their take on the current game state is seeing as none have posted yet today.", "time": "Thu Apr 06, 2017 5:29 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71119&start=825", "forum": "53", "thread": "71119"}

I have no idea why twoface thinks scum-hans-slot wouldn't kill two people in a row that suspected him, especially when hans would have made the first kill and oneironaut would have made the second (meaning there might not have been a train of thought there). But basically oneironaut-scum getting lynched today is probably game over for the scum, because they're left with 1 alive going into 7p with 2 mislynches, they haven't managed to kill a single power role (and they're clearly assuming that there's a protective role out there since IAWS is alive and blocked), and the existence of wheme and IAWS as basically un-mislynchable slots complicates things beyond all that. <br>\n<br>\nBeyond that, onei's posting isn't particularly stellar either. His one action so far was to criticize fitz for buddying him. He's attacking fitz for posting walls, which is entirely stylistic and a very easy point to get into the ground and look like you're starting to contribute to the game. He accuses fitz of buddying but doesn't really explain why townreading his slot is in and of itself a scummy thing to do; he merely says that he wouldn't if he didn't know that he was town. A bunch of his specific points are really, really reaching to the point where I find it difficult to believe that a townie could believe them to be true (DRK used small text in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9008273#p9008273\">25</a>, where it was clearly there, therefore DRK was trying to obfuscate/communicate to scumbuddies? fitz sought clarification on the lover claim... therefore he was fishing???)<br>\n<br>\nThe latter of those points in particular looks like scum making shit up to fit the narrative that they're pushing. It's also probably not a bus (I don't think scum would be particularly likely to bus in this particular situation), which means it's probably not onei+fitz.<br>\n<br>\nBeyond all this I have a theory on DRK's play this game which is that part of the reason she was so apathetic was that she didn't like her scumteam or thought that they wouldn't be able to win. I say this because it fits with hans-scum, because DRK clearly didn't think hans was competent. It would also fit with kop/cmm-scum.", "time": "Tue Apr 11, 2017 4:07 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71119&start=1175", "forum": "53", "thread": "71119"}

I left it alone because 1) I didn't think questioning him was going to get any further and 2) I <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9025298#p9025298\">assumed he was saying Darklyn was claiming</a> <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9007205#p9007205\">fruit vendor</a>....hence the rough spot.

My inclination to townread his recent responses is mostly a result of the tone that he's taken with twoface and iaws and in general. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9083620#p9083620\">1207</a> doesn't feel like a scum reaction; that's largely gut though.

I don't think he's faking the frustration over twoface's play; I think it'd be much more expedient as scum to take a softer stance, try to placate twoface and get him to tunnel elsewhere, etc. I don't think fitz would give up in the way that he is, in a sense. He isn't really actually giving up but he's given up on saying anything to twoface, and the way that he's doing it looks to me like town who is frustrated rather than caught scum. Things like the point-by-point refutation in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9084552#p9084552\">1251</a> cement this because I think fitz as scum doesn't have a good reason to spend so much effort berating twoface over every little point because it doesn't actually accomplish anything for him and he'd just be acting facetiously because he'd know tf was right. On the other hand fitz as town does have reason to make that refutation because he'd be rightly angry over twoface's tunnel. Townies don't always just do everything with the #1 priority of winning the game; lots of actions are motivated by emotion, and in this case it seems more consistent to me that his actions come from town.", "time": "Wed Apr 12, 2017 4:24 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71119&start=1325", "forum": "53", "thread": "71119"}

See what he finds so &#8220;substantial.&#8221;<br>\n <br>\nOne&#8217;s first dig at me is that I was <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">townreading his predecessor</div>.  Which he found hard to believe because <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Amish Tell</div>.  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\">    Also...I don't recall ever saying it was \"Strong\".  That's a bit of exaggeration iirc.<br>\n <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">So One</div>...IF you are actually town...why would the first person you choose to focus on in the game be the lone person, iirc, in the game who is not scum reading you?  Virtually everybody in the game wants you lynched except me...so I'm scum.  Gawd this game is frustrating.  First off...I'm not \"whiteknighting\" anything because I'm not defending your slot.  Saying I have a gut meta town read on Hans is not whiteknighting.  If others want to lynch you....more power to them.  If you want to call it buddying...I guess the same could be said of anyone town reading you.  Which as I said before...I think is no one.<br>\n <br>\nAs for basing a read on pure meta...as TwoFace has shown in this game....not everyone plays with the same mindset.  You don't like meta?  Fine.  I'm not a big advocate of it myself...but I do trust my gut and my gut was telling me Hans was town based on the short time he was here.  If you are town and find that so foreign then I don't know what else to say.<br>\n <br>\nAs for finding <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9078917#p9078917\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">my comments on Boon strange</div></a>...I wrote that catch up prior to the night resolving and I didn't edit him out.  Similar to my my catch up to N3 that had Stone Cold in them.  No reason to edit them out.  It let's people know what I was thinking about whatever it was I commented on&#8230;whether they like it or not.<br>\n <br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9080406#p9080406\">Next post</a>....in addition to the <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">\"buddying\"</div>....you suspect me for <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">posting filler.</div>  If by filler you mean content that isn't saying anything I would argue that is for the most part not true.  Everyone makes posts that aren't explicitly aimed at scum hunting but otherwise I think much of my content has been towards finding scum or exhanges with other players.  It might also just be a playstyle thing.  I don't feel I've been posting any differently in this game then in any other town games I have.<br>\n <br>\nFishing&#8230;.in reference to asking Boon and/or Eddie about the lover claim.  I don&#8217;t see how discussing a role that had already been claimed in the game is fishing.  In fact&#8230;by the time I asked about it we already had one player (CD) sentenced to hang for being upset about it being claimed (<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">good work there Eddie&#8230;nice pro-scum gambit that turned out to be</div>).  So to accuse me of fishing for something that was a large topic of discussion is not accurate.  You can&#8217;t fish if the fish is already out of the water. <br>\n <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Linking to posts in my catch ups.</div>  Seriously?  This is the stupidest reason of them all.  I post primarily from my phone and it is too difficult for my catch ups to do a lot of quoting.  It&#8217;s much easier to link to whatever posts caught my eye and provide comment if necessary.  Apologies if this is too much work for you to read but it&#8217;s how I catch up.  And anyone in here that has played with me before can most likely confirm.  I know TwoFace can because he bitches about them all the time.<br>\n <br>\nYou go on in a <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9005915#p9005915\">later post</a> to list my first 4 votes and label them.  Not sure how this shows suspicion but lets review.<br>\n1st vote on horror you call RVS and you would be correct.  NAI I assume?<br>\n2nd vote on CooLDoG you call naked (it was) because &#8220;it was the wagon to be on at the time&#8221;.  Actually&#8230;the trending wagon at this point was DRK with 2 votes.  CMM also had two votes.  So I could have brought either of them to a 3rd vote too.  I wasn&#8217;t on CD long but the time I was there was just to pressure him and try to get a better read on him.    I got off his wagon before anyone else voted himwhen another player drew my suspicions.<br>\n3rd and 4th votes&#8230;.not sure how putting a vote down within a wall post is suspect.  Especially when some degree of reason was given for both in addition to much other content (non filler) in the wallposts.<br>\n <br>\nSo in summary&#8230;if I am correct&#8230;your &#8220;substantial scum read on me is due to:<br>\n <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">townreading your predecessor</div>.  aka <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">\"buddying\"</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">my post-mortem leftover comments on Boon and Stone Cold</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">posting filler</div> <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Linking to posts in my catch ups.</div> annnnd maybe because you didn&#8217;t like the way I voted people I suspected?  smh&#8230;<br>\n <br>\nThat&#8217;s a massive heap of shit for a case with the last 3-4 points being completely based on formatting playstyle.  Which is completely NAI.  If you want to stand your ground because you don&#8217;t like the fact your predecessor was being town read from me for gut based on a previous game (loosely aka meta) then I can not defend that opinion.  But it&#8217;s a weak one at that when you, if town, should be more concerned with the people who are finding you scummy.  Because that fits scum&#8217;s agenda if you are town&#8230;while me town reading Hans, and by continuation you, does not", "time": "Fri Apr 14, 2017 6:45 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71119&start=1525", "forum": "53", "thread": "71119"}

I haven't specifically said I'm scum reading Fitz, but he's in my lynch pool along with you, and One. But he's the last person I'd look at right now, because of the doubts I have of there being scum within the neighbourhood. You've looked on the wiki page of the role, and seen that most instances there could be scum in the neighbourhood, and you've ran with that idea that there is definite scum in there. <br>\n<br>\nNow I'm thinking outside of the box, and just think that the neighbourhood has been put in to create confusion, and that it could actually be full of all town. So that would mean scum will be outside of it, and that's where I'm looking at right now. So that leaves, myself, you, one and Eddie. If I had a good shout, it'd be you and one for scum. <br>\n<br>\n3. If I was scum and wanted to bring doubt to your claim, that would have been done on the start of day 2.

So many things wrong with this post.<br>\n1) How out-of-touch are you with the gamestate that you think scum might not be able to get you lynched? You're at L-2 and literally the only person who called you town as far as I can remember was fitz and he's dead.<br>\n2) Why are you softclaiming something that scum would want to kill...? What benefit is there to that? At all? Are you trying to WIFOM scum? As the person perceived as by far the scummiest? How does this make any sense at all?<br>\n3) Why are you softclaiming...... at all??? What benefit is there to randomly softclaiming your role? Why softclaim and not hardclaim? Either you realize you're almost definitely the lynch (in which case, you have no reason not to just outright hardclaim) or you don't (in which case...)<br>\n4) Why are you claiming in any way at all? Your rhetoric makes it clear that you don't realize you're by far the most likely lynch target today, which makes me think that you're not claiming in response to pressure.", "time": "Wed Apr 19, 2017 6:17 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71119&start=1775", "forum": "53", "thread": "71119"}

Answer and explain your reasoning</div></blockquote>\nWow, not a leading question at all!<br>\n<br>\nFirst, no, I would not say that this is a specific enough action to be alignment-indicative on its own. That's an extremely general action. There are tons of different ways to lie.<br>\n<br>\nTo answer the question that you're obviously intending to ask, I don't think cooldog has lied. If i'm reading correctly the lies are:<br>\n1) the thinking the claim was real, which I've argued about extensively and pointed out that havingfitz <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">also thought it was real.</div> Did fitz lie too? Are they both scum for that?<br>\n2) the \"premeditated\" thing, where he says to wait for the vote-prodded response, then accuses wheme of only posting when prodded by votes. This is a much better point than point 1 actually, I'd say it's worth some amount of scumpoints for cooldog, but over my years on this site I have discovered and accounted for what was probably my largest bias: thinking that logic is indicative of town. It isn't, and the reverse holds as well: incorrect logic is not indicative of scum.<br>\n<br>\nIt's possible that cooldog set that up to try to make wheme look facetiously scummy, but (a) that's not a particularly strong way of getting others to agree with you because we'll obviously see through it and (b) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">it doesn't exactly take a lot to paint wheme as scummy</div>. Wheme is a player who naturally obscures his opinions and it's very easy to push a case on him; there's no need for scum-cooldog to go out of his way like this. It's still possible and so he gets some amount of scum points for that, but it's perfectly possible as well that he is simply perceiving the game through a different lens that we are. Maybe he didn't realize that wheme had been posting earlier, maybe he has some other explanation; he hasn't commented since it. <br>\n<br>\nTo be completely honest, it's actually grating on my nerves to defend his point. I agree with you that cooldog's point here is absolutely terrible. But I see it more strongly as bad play than as scummy play. I completely see the train of thought and I don't fault you for scumreading him for it even if you are wrong. I've just seen too many players saying stupid things as town to think that it's as heavily scum-indicative as you're saying you think it is.</div></blockquote>\n\n<br>\nToo many words to say scummy play is okay.

{"number": 2355, "id": "9155634", "user": "implosion", "user_id": "14368", "content": "So, superhans/oneironaut/notmafia.<br>\n<br>\nTo me, reason number one that this slot is scum is still and has always been nightkills. Why does scum kill boon then stone cold? As I've said, this point is more valid from my own point of view, because Stone Cold was pseudo tunneling myself along with superhans, but that doesn't apply to the boon kill. I really think scum don't make both of those kills if oneironaut is scum; neither of those slots showed any indication that they were slowing down in their pressure on superhans, and i think in practice in today's meta scum don't generally kill just to frame. They kill players who are active and/or who have good reads, or occasionally PR reads. Killing Stone Cold in particular I think makes almost no sense fmpov if hans was town; why kill a slot that's being active enough that I highly doubt it was a PR read, that was strongly pushing two town slots as its primary suspects? Makes no sense at all. But again, that point relies on me being town, so it's not as useful from others' point of view unless they have a townread on me.<br>\n<br>\nNumber two is the claim. I feel like I shouldn't need to spell this out so plainly in a game where people (read: twoface and eddie) have been tunneling left and right based on \"lies\" that were meaningless. But this is not a meaningless lie. There is absolutely NO town motivation for softclaiming a power role in the situation oneironaut was in as a vanilla townie. Zero. It is only explainable as flatly terrible play, more terrible than I think I'm willing to accept as being even vaguely likely. Oneironaut was under a TON of pressure. If he's town, he knows he's going to get grilled after softclaiming. Almost certainly, he thought that he was going down and was looking for some out, any out, and so he softclaimed in the hopes that people would buy it. NM then claimed vt because he didn't know that his slot had softclaimed earlier. <br>\n<br>\nNumber three, superhans was a scummy slot. I think like everyone agrees on this so I'm not going to ISO him again.<br>\n<br>\nNumber four, oneironaut's play was scummy. I criticized his early posting (and made the NK argument that I just rehashed) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9081878#p9081878\">here</a>. After that, he starts an <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9091933#p9091933\">entirely semantic</a> argument with twoface, an extremely easy avenue to take as scum, because it's an argument that lets you be correct in a meaningless (non-alignment-indicative) way. Actually a lot of the rest of his iso pings slightly town or mostly null to me (the way he talks to twoface late). But I think the negatives somewhat outweigh the positives.", "time": "Fri Apr 28, 2017 3:34 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71119&start=2350", "forum": "53", "thread": "71119"}

{"number": 2522, "id": "9180844", "user": "implosion", "user_id": "14368", "content": "The only real tactical consideration right now is that Titus should protect somewhat arbitrarily tonight/shouldn't say too much about who she's protecting; this forces scum to either kill her or risk giving us an extra mislynch. This works because the remaining scum is an even-night rb, and tonight is an odd night. If Titus saves someone tonight, obviously we lynch tomorrow because we'll be in odds. If we mislynch today and Titus (or anyone else) dies, then we'll be at 4p and we no-lynch tomorrow since there's technically no one alive who's formally clear.<br>\n<br>\nMy scum pool right now is basically math and hiraki, and I lean pretty heavily towards math. A quick look at Eddie's ISO ctrl+f'ing hans's name looks pretty bad as well. He *consistently* has hans as the \"next person to lynch.\" On d1, he says he thinks cd and hans are both scum but <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9057827#p9057827\">is more confident</a> in a cd flip. Before the DRK lynch he waffles around voting hans and eventually does vote him, calling him <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9072497#p9072497\">the second scum</a> after DRK while DRK is getting wagoned. However, early in d3, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9081543#p9081543\">his reads suddenly change</a> with the theory that DRK's scumflip implicated me, and he suddenly conveniently has someone else to push over hans now that the scumteam's traitor is dead. Later that day, hans is once again placed behind someone else, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9088245#p9088245\">this time fitz.</a><br>\n<br>\nPoint is: he constantly, constantly talks about how he finds hans scummy. And yet, his pressure on that slot never ever amounts to anything; his one vote on the slot is essentially a kneejerk reaction to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9071498#p9071498\">920</a>, and never really contributes any meaningful pressure. The rest of the time, he always manages to find someone else to vote for or to push as the better lynch while being able to very effectively distance from hans.<br>\n<br>\nDisclaimer is that this post actually might be confbias; i am interested in hearing other opinions on this. But I really think this looks like scum distancing. I feel like town at least meaningfully votes hans at some point during all of this. It's like eddie saw twoface as this big town personality who was wrong about everything, and basically took the opportunity to loudly sheep all of twoface's opinions so that he could effectively distance from his scumbuddy while coordinating with the townie who was wrong about things.<br>\n<br>\nWill probably look deeper at Kop ISO next.", "time": "Thu May 04, 2017 8:35 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71119&start=2500", "forum": "53", "thread": "71119"}

I don't know if you are mistaken or if you are trying to confuse either scum or town with it, but I'm going to clarify it. <br>\n<br>\nFirst, unless I'm very much misinformed, WhemeStar is confirmed town. Unless you're telling me that scum have a player who is both an Even-Night Roleblocker and a Full-Time Fruit Vendor and can also perform the night kill.<br>\n<br>\nSecond, scum have literally zero incentive to kill anyone but Titus. This is because targeting WhemeStar leaves the chance of him being protected and leaving the two remaining VTs together alive creates a bigger smokescreen for the scum.<br>\n<br>\nThird, your very premise of us leaving somebody alive tomorrow is flawed, because since WhemeStar is conftown (unless I've misunderstood something), he'll be the next target. That means we have to lynch scum either today or tomorrow to win. There is no way around it unless we abstain from voting today and tomorrow, but that's just going to result in the same scenario, only with less conftown on the board.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9180844#p9180844\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9180844#p9180844\" data-post-id=\"9180844\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 2522</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14368\">implosion</a> wrote:</cite>My scum pool right now is basically math and hiraki, and I lean pretty heavily towards math.

{"number": 2554, "id": "9185927", "user": "implosion", "user_id": "14368", "content": "IMO, there are several effective ways to approach setup spec; however, there are often situations in which setup spec should be considered a priori, that is, before putting significant weight on how townish or scummy someone's play looks. This is one of those cases; i'm willing to write titus and wheme off as town at this point without reading a single post that they've posted. I do independently have a strong townread on wheme and a weak townread on titus's predecessor (i haven't actually made any material effort to read into titus's alignment since massclaim). Point is, in many cases, setup spec is more reliable because it can't be faked. Any towntell can be faked, any scumtell can be you misreading into something. With setup spec in some cases, the only way you can get it wrong is by doing the math wrong, and in some cases the math is obvious enough that you really can't get it wrong. IMO, this is one of those cases, where the setup is so overwhelmingly scumsided if we don't have a doctor that it's absurd that it would pass review.<br>\n<br>\nComparing it to the only other mini normal that I can think of that had a traitor, it had a setup of (goon + goon + bp traitor) vs (gunsmith + 3-shot jailkeeper + 1-shot vig + townies); gunsmith is comparable but a bit weaker than cop, 3-shot jk is comparable to doctor, 1-shot vig is stronger than fruit vendor (it confirms itself as not mafia and also gets a kill and possibly an extra mislynch in in conjunction with the jailkeeper) AND the mafia don't have any roleblocker (which is IMO stronger than making the traitor bulletproof). So that setup is comparable to or a bit more townsided than this setup if Titus is telling the truth, and MASSIVELY more townsided than this if Titus is lying. And that setup was STILL called scumsided in postgame. And most importantly, discussion of mini normal balance on MS since then has erred on the side of making things more townsided.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway this is just a thing that's easy for me to rant about. We really need Wheme to start actually posting fucking anything at all today.
