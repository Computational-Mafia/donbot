If you have a question or concern, or if you think that I may have made an error, do not hesitate to ask in-topic or by pm. Be sure to bold requests directed at me so that I see them.<br><br>Voting, Lynching, and Deadlines:<br>5. Votes must be bolded. Some mods require you to unvote before changing your vote; I do not.<br>6. A lynch requires a majority (over 50%) vote.<br>7. You may also vote for no lynch to happen on that day by typing Vote: No lynch. A no-lynch only requires a 50% vote to go through.<br>8. Each day will have a 14 day deadline.

If you are going away, or if you have limited access to the site, notify me by pm or in-topic so that I know not to prod or replace you. If you're going to be V/LA over the night phase and have a night action, you may send in your action early.

How you follow up will decide where my read on you goes. Up till now, I haven't seen anything great come from your slot, and while others have done the same, you're one of the ones who's also seemingly active.<br><br>Also, I understand that tells like that may not fully convince you that someone is scum, but you don't have to know that someone is scum to vote them. If they do something slightly scummy, and there hasn't been much else going on (aka start of the game), then you might as well vote them. I don't think tells have to convince you of anything, they just have to be scummy enough to deserve a vote and some pressure. TBH, I'm kinda getting off topic here. You simply said that they aren't fully alignment indicative, that's true, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't act on them.<br><br>Yeah, I saw your explanation, and I guess my question there is a bit of an empty one. However, it read to me as someone just bringing something up for the sake of having something to talk about, which is something scum loves to do because it hides the fact that they aren't really contributing anything.

I suppose I can't expect you to have heavy scum and town reads at this point, but saying something useful would be nice. Posting about null reads is useless. Useless posting. I would rather you have expanded on your one scum read, BBT. Why are you voting him exactly? You want to generate discussion? What a vague answer. Do you actually think he is scum? If so, provide more reason than your first post you voted him in. He's posted a lot since then, has he done more scummy things that require a vote?<br><br>I think, I to, am happy where my vote is."}

PB then makes post 53 which seems overly aggressive, but then in 55 and 57 backtracks / clarifies, so I am more inclined to go with it not being a serious post.<br><br>I want to see more from RadiantCowbells, as so far the posts have seem very reactionary and not too analytical, but ultimately I don't have a read either way at this point.<br><br>I like Dannflor's post in 82 for the most part [including sarcasm] although I think he is intentionally ignoring some of my previous posts in which I already answered some of the questions he asked - this makes me feel like he could be trying to jump on a seemingly logical bandwagon and so I have a slight scumread. However, since multiple people have brought up the scumminess of discussing multiple scum-teams so early, I will be willing to drop my scumread given a decent explanation as to my mistakes / misunderstandings of optimal strategy so far.<br><br>I also like Dannflor's post in 85 as well, which makes me less confident in a scumread, but at this point there isn't exactly enough content for me to be particularly confident either way.<br><br>In general, I am happy with my vote for the moment as I believe it has potential to add to the discussion, but I will strongly consider changing it depending on how the next few pages go.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>Also, I think I'll read the ISO's of both BBT and PB. First read through gives me the impression that they are both town. I'll give it a second look though, considering that seems to be the area where most of the votes are headed right now. I think Rune is our best bet for now though.<br><br><span style=\"color: indigo\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Spoilered accidental quote wall. ~Nik</span></span></span>"}

Yes, BBT could easily be scum and tunneling on Reverend while still asking a few simple questions to others, and if this is the case I simply don't think the argument with Reverend is likely to cause him to slip. It's based mostly on semantics. So, until I see BBT slip something, I'm happy with a town read, and will stand by that. - This ignoring the fact that I don't like his original couple of posts, but as I've mentioned I'm generally forgiving of very early posts and see that now as a difference in playstyle choice.<br><br>I would like to see TDA post a bit more since I have a hard time believing his current posts come from a townie.<br><br>@Axe  &amp; Elyse (and anyone else) - why the townread on RC so far? She has 7 posts, most of which say nothing. This isn't OMGUS, but really she hasn't done much yet. I'm hoping post 167 pans out.<br><br>I like Elyse and Dannflor for town at the moment, I agree in general with most of their reads.<br><br>@The Reverend post 155 - What line of inquiry? Starting at post 126 it really devolves and in my opinion stops benefitting town, thus my statement to that effect shortly thereafter.<br><br>@Dannflor in 151.<br>     1) Yes I have made many observations, the majority of which up until this point have not led to a firm stance. Considering the stage we are at in the game, I am comfortable with my posting to this point, and don't feel that I need to have strong reads on everybody. I think providing my opinions, regardless of the alignment indication, can either help influence other people's opinions or allow counterarguments to help me adjust my own.<br>     2) It was not my intention to say that wagons are bad - I don't believe that at all. I just dislike the out-of-the-gate \"I need to vote on a wagon, refuse to start one on my own, and will hop onto any that exist.\" I also never said that because discussion was generated it led to a town read, you are putting words in my mouth. I am, however, admittedly biased against lurkers, and want to make sure I am able to consider posts from everybody before making stronger reads, which has contributed in large part to your criticisms of my posts. I attribute this to playstyle, but you're obviously free to take from it whatever you like.<br>     3) Regarding PB, it was the aggregation of useless posts along with the small reads from one or two of them, which make me think it is unlikely town would start like that.<br>     4) I feel like I've already addressed in this post why I had an immediate dislike to BBT's start of the game. Since then, he has asked a few people valid questions and has pursued Reverend in what is a justifiable position and to a degree that I read as likely town - which more than one person agrees with. I don't think it's fair to assume that my BBT vote was indicative of a really strong read (in the context of all my posts, that's obviously not the case). I didn't like his early posts, voted for him, and decided that once was wagon hopping was done I slowly started to like his posts better. Pretty simple."}

Considering the stage we are at in the game, I am comfortable with my posting to this point, and don't feel that I need to have strong reads on everybody. I think providing my opinions, regardless of the alignment indication, can either help influence other people's opinions or allow counterarguments to help me adjust my own.     <br>2) It was not my intention to say that wagons are bad - I don't believe that at all. I just dislike the out-of-the-gate \"I need to vote on a wagon, refuse to start one on my own, and will hop onto any that exist.\" I also never said that because discussion was generated it led to a town read, you are putting words in my mouth. I am, however, admittedly biased against lurkers, and want to make sure I am able to consider posts from everybody before making stronger reads, which has contributed in large part to your criticisms of my posts. I attribute this to playstyle, but you're obviously free to take from it whatever you like.     <br>3) Regarding PB, it was the aggregation of useless posts along with the small reads from one or two of them, which make me think it is unlikely town would start like that.     <br>4) I feel like I've already addressed in this post why I had an immediate dislike to BBT's start of the game. Since then, he has asked a few people valid questions and has pursued Reverend in what is a justifiable position and to a degree that I read as likely town - which more than one person agrees with. I don't think it's fair to assume that my BBT vote was indicative of a really strong read (in the context of all my posts, that's obviously not the case). I didn't like his early posts, voted for him, and decided that once was wagon hopping was done I slowly started to like his posts better. Pretty simple.</div></blockquote><br><br>1) You are right to an extent. Posting opinions is helpful. You seem to be mistaken in that you think that you are posting opinions. Your posts so far consist of saying \"X is weird\" or then later saying \"but I really don't think much of it because X\". You aren't posting things helpful to town, you're just posting null reads. Unless someone specifically asks you are a read on someone specific, why would you explain null reads? Saying \"I dunno\" is not helpful, put your focus where you think there is scum and where you think there is definite town. Don't fence sit.<br><br>2) Yeah, I misread your post, you didn't say you had a town read on Reverend. My apologies. (in fact you gave him a null read, interesting)<br><br>3) &amp; 4) Fair enough.<br><br>I still don't like Rune's posting, so that's where my vote will stay ATM. I still haven't fulfilled my promise to ISO both BBT and PB, but I'll try to do that soon so I can get a read or two on someone besides Rune."}

I don't like that all of a sudden you realize how little PB has posted and hop onto a really convenient wagon that's been there for a while. 11 posts in the firsts three pages, 1 in page 4, and 1 later. The first few are game-related but if a player's contributions are almost exlcusively p1 or p2, something is seriously off. Several players have called him out, you should have seen this earlier. I don't mind your vote only coming now as much, but you should have realized the behaviour existed.<br><br>You then agree with me that the posting styles of me and PB are really not fairly comparable, which makes me think you could have been trying to be opportunistic beforehand, and took the obvious out when I called you out for it.<br><br>Most importantly, you have basically decided to sit on a big PB fence and vote for him, which you've essentially been vocally upset at me for allegedly doing, which you even mentioned in that post. I feel like this, alongside with the fact that if you missed PB's behaviour earlier, you've probably still got a lot of other things to catch up on, make me very suspicious of the rest of the content you've posted.<br><br>The amount of lurking is something else that I've mentioned several times, and I mean SEVERAL. As early as page 5 (post 120), post 169, and post 192 are all examples of me making it very clear that not everyone is contributing and it is entirely possible we have tvt going on. I have used many of my posts to call people out to ask them to be more detailed in their posts (TDA, RC) or to post more (Jake) (probably others).<br><br>My real difficulty here is that I agree with most of your post. PB would be playing a really weak scum if he actually scum flips. There are too many lurkers. It just seems like your post is designed to feel organic and original but in fact agrees with a lot that I've been saying without explicitly mentioning it, and shows that you've been to this point selectively looking at specific posts and ignoring others before posting. That seems more scum than town.<br><br>ugh there's just so much there that has been obvious for ages, and it shows you didn't really look before comparing me to PB, as you've obviously completely changed your stance. <br><br>Convince me I'm wrong.

I don't like that all of a sudden you realize how little PB has posted and hop onto a really convenient wagon that's been there for a while. 11 posts in the firsts three pages, 1 in page 4, and 1 later. The first few are game-related but if a player's contributions are almost exlcusively p1 or p2, something is seriously off. Several players have called him out, you should have seen this earlier. I don't mind your vote only coming now as much, but you should have realized the behaviour existed.<br><br>You then agree with me that the posting styles of me and PB are really not fairly comparable, which makes me think you could have been trying to be opportunistic beforehand, and took the obvious out when I called you out for it.<br><br>Most importantly, you have basically decided to sit on a big PB fence and vote for him, which you've essentially been vocally upset at me for allegedly doing, which you even mentioned in that post. I feel like this, alongside with the fact that if you missed PB's behaviour earlier, you've probably still got a lot of other things to catch up on, make me very suspicious of the rest of the content you've posted.<br><br>The amount of lurking is something else that I've mentioned several times, and I mean SEVERAL. As early as page 5 (post 120), post 169, and post 192 are all examples of me making it very clear that not everyone is contributing and it is entirely possible we have tvt going on. I have used many of my posts to call people out to ask them to be more detailed in their posts (TDA, RC) or to post more (Jake) (probably others).<br><br>My real difficulty here is that I agree with most of your post. PB would be playing a really weak scum if he actually scum flips. There are too many lurkers. It just seems like your post is designed to feel organic and original but in fact agrees with a lot that I've been saying without explicitly mentioning it, and shows that you've been to this point selectively looking at specific posts and ignoring others before posting. That seems more scum than town.<br><br>ugh there's just so much there that has been obvious for ages, and it shows you didn't really look before comparing me to PB, as you've obviously completely changed your stance. <br><br>Convince me I'm wrong. I'll let you know if my second impression feels better than my first, but those are my thoughts.</div></blockquote><br><br>I never said it was post 222 that started it. You've been acting better for a while now. When I originally put my vote on you, I wanted to see how you would contribute in the future and how you would react to my questions, since there wasn't much there at the time. I thought you delivered quite well, which cancels my case completely. Since my case is simply the fact that you weren't posting well.<br><br>You're right in the fact I didn't really look. I'll admit that much. My focus was more on how the reasoning was similar than the actual posting. You prodded me to actually give it a closer look."}

I just think it's relevant to point out.<br><br>My read on you would change to neutral if you hadn't posted today because you have exactly 6 posts to this point, none of which have given me a scumread (in fact, the opposite). But if I can't trust you to post when you say you will post when you have almost no posts to begin with, I refuse to reward you with a townread. Obviously if you came back tomorrow and gave a reasonable excuse for not posting when you said you would and I believed you, that would be ok too.<br><br>Upon reflection I'm not sure I explained how my reads were meant to be read well enough. I labeled the last section as \"townish\" not \"town\" and specified at the end that I really am looking at D1 lynch candidates. I mentioned several times beforehand my reluctance to scumread Rev, but if he was going to blatantly manipulate my words like that, it seemed like an easy tell. However, I think it is perfectly plausible that he just made a mistake, since he owned up to it really quickly as you mentioned. Since in general his playstyle here is wildly aggressive and without great logic (as evidenced by his admitting that he has blinders for arceus despite the obvious ridiculousness of his posts against me), I think it isn't too hard to imagine this is a mistake he could have realistically made. That being said, it is also possible he is hiding as scum behind poor town play, but I don't think he is a good D1 lynch candidate at all, so I'd rather put him borderline town.<br><br>You'll also notice that my neutral reads are really people who I don't have a read on (I did specify it was largely a category for people who I had little or no information on). It might have been appropriate to put them in a separate section instead of in the middle between scum and town (I did that to keep convention, but I expected the meaning to be clear based on the people in it)<br><br>I really like my top 3 scumreads though right now, and I like the order that they are in. Generally I don't like to commit to associative reads D1 but Arceus jumping in so soon after Dan scumslips and replaces out really seems to me to be his way of trying to bring the attention off of Dan/Palkia, by attacking me without having to defend Dan and thus he thinks he will avoid showing his association. Otherwise, it would have been optimal for Arceus to simply lie low, which would have been easy. I think Palkia's annoying play right now gives absolutely no reason to consider any other lynch candidate without strong evidence. You probably stand a decent chance of convincing me that Arceus is a good lynch, and I'll definitely consider it, but I'm hoping that his posts improve quickly or at least make more contextual sense.<br><br>@Rev<br><br>Can you see why this could hurt the town? Just because someone agrees with your points, doesn't make them town. Just because they disagree, doesn't make them scum. Arceus' argument is poor, regardless of my alignment. Admitting the possibility of having blinkers on makes me sad, because it is an easy way for you to avoid being read.

If the set of Palkia, Oversoul, Hostile, and Havoc doesn't contain at least two members of a scumteam, I will be surprised.<br><br>I don't think Axe would be scum with anyone other than Havoc (in a scenario where town could win at this point), and so I would lynch Havoc before thinking about lynching Axe.<br><br>There are enough people who deserve to be lynched at this point that I don't think adding Axe into that pile is going to help town.<br><br>pedit: Jake I'll get to you in my next post."}

I just find it interesting that you are already going to such great lengths to begin building a scum team with me at the center. It assumes that I am a good scum player (I'm not) and the team would defer to my judgment (probably wouldn't), and it just flat out assumes that I am scum (I'm not). Back when I played a lot of games I would construct teams based on a single person, watching their interactions with those people, etc. Unfortunately, more often than not I was wrong about the central person that I used to anchor my reads, so I would be dejected with the game and my ability and just play shitty once that person flipped town or something.<br><br>In a way, I did that with PB and Elyse.

I did notice his use of random names and assumed they were nicknames or that he was just confused as he had been earlier, but I'll take your word for it that they represent other games he is playing. However, Rev has been consistently bad and has responded consistently enough to different scenarios throughout this game that I am quite confident he is town. I also think his response to my townread of him is pretty town.<br><br>I really dislike that you are scumreading people for not actively scumhunting when their primary scumreads are clearly people who are inactive. Jake has consistently attempted to question Palkia D2 and it isn't his fault that this game is full of lurkers.

There is an obvious scum motivation for moving the wagon to PB. I don't think there is a town motivation for the tail end of the PB wagon. This makes me very convinced that Havoc is scum.<br><br>Why should I let my oversoul scumread go? Nothing has been posted that makes me confident he is town.<br><br>Just because no one is defending Havoc doesn't mean he is town. It could equally mean scum acknowledge a lost cause and are willing to bus at this point. Your argument is once again not very sound."}

Very subtle, which is good, but easily a fall-back if scum surmise that there are no protective roles in the game. I can't imagine that to be the case at this point. So, as it stands, Elyse is the obvious scum here.

I'd point out that said wagon is exactly the wagon on Elyse right now.

I don't think both scum were on the PB counter wagon though.</span><br><br><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">So we agree, that assuming you are town, either Hostile or Palkia are scum?

What do you think about HI townreading both you and Palkia given my above statement? <span class=\"noboldsig\">I think she could be scum. I think she might be trying to stall a claim.

Right now, who would you be willing to lynch? What information you would get from those flips?<span class=\"noboldsig\">I am willing to lynch Elyse, Jake, HI, Palkia. My preferences may change. Elyse would give us information on Palkia. Palkia would also give us some associative tells. HI + Jake because I really dislike their play so far, not entirely sure what can be gleamed from HI given her iso. Jake probably would give us some associative tells too.</span><br><br><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Jake's play today has been really subpar. I understand the town motivation for this lynch. However, I really don't think it is optimal, although I haven't ISO'd him and no immediate associatives come to mind except weak pushes on Palkia. Either way, I would rank Jake as the lowest priority of the four you mentioned. My problem with GS Guilty lynch is that I don't trust Palkia, and I don't necessarily trust Elyse's VT claim. I don't think that a flip on either of these players gives DEFINITIVE information, at least from my perspective. I think we have options which will give definitive information. For example, I am quite confident that you (oversoul) and HI are opposite alignments.</span></span><br><br><br>Do you agree we are probably look at a 10-3 setup (I don't think Havoc was operating independently)? In this case, which pairs do you think are the remainder of the team with Havoc? <span class=\"noboldsig\">Yes. The norm on MS is for games to be 10:3. I dunno who the pairs are yet. Need more information. I have a couple of speculations maybe, but I don't want to reveal them just yet. </span><br><br><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">That is fair.

I'd point out that said wagon is exactly the wagon on Elyse right now. If you disagree, please do your best to explain it, because this is obviously a sore point for me. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Yes, I think we can agree on that.

I agree it is probable that there is one scum on the counter wagon.</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Yes. I think that either Hostile or Palkia are scum. This is going into my pairings that I don't want to reveal though.</span><br><br>2. What do you think about HI townreading both you and Palkia given my above statement? <span class=\"noboldsig\">I think she could be scum. I think she might be trying to stall a claim. I wish Palkia would stop being a lurker and definitively say he has a guilty on Elyse, otherwise I will lynch HI.</span><br><br><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Palkia being a lurker is a huge problem and I really don't trust him enough to base my actions at this point on his posts. Until that changes, I believe we have enough information available to the whole town to do a good job at hunting scum independently of Palkia.</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">I agree. I want him to confirm or deny his guilty and then proceed to lynch based on that information. I agree we probably information outside of Palkia to come to a consensus. I'm not entirely sure where that consensus should be. I am thinking within {Jake, Rev, Saint}.<br><br><br>3. Right now, who would you be willing to lynch? What information you would get from those flips?[b]I am willing to lynch Elyse, Jake, HI, Palkia. My preferences may change. Elyse would give us information on Palkia. Palkia would also give us some associative tells. HI + Jake because I really dislike their play so far, not entirely sure what can be gleamed from HI given her iso. Jake probably would give us some associative tells too.</span><br><br><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Jake's play today has been really subpar. I understand the town motivation for this lynch. However, I really don't think it is optimal, although I haven't ISO'd him and no immediate associatives come to mind except weak pushes on Palkia. Either way, I would rank Jake as the lowest priority of the four you mentioned. My problem with GS Guilty lynch is that I don't trust Palkia, and I don't necessarily trust Elyse's VT claim. I don't think that a flip on either of these players gives DEFINITIVE information, at least from my perspective. I think we have options which will give definitive information. For example, I am quite confident that you (oversoul) and HI are opposite alignments.</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">You think Elyse is lying about her claim? I don't.<br>I think an Elyse townflip definitively points to a Palkia-scum.</span><br><br><br>Do you agree we are probably look at a 10-3 setup (I don't think Havoc was operating independently)? In this case, which pairs do you think are the remainder of the team with Havoc? <span class=\"noboldsig\">Yes. The norm on MS is for games to be 10:3. I dunno who the pairs are yet. Need more information. I have a couple of speculations maybe, but I don't want to reveal them just yet. </span><br><br><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">That is fair. When you feel like bringing up possibilities, let me know. I think either today or D4 we are ready to put forward more information, such as this.</span></span><br><br><br>Out of curiosity, am I the only one who noticed that Palkia didn't regret the lynch of PB (who flipped town) but immediately posted 'regret' on the hammer of Havoc (who then flipped scum). I didn't mention this earlier but I thought it was odd.<span class=\"noboldsig\">Yes, I saw this. Yes, I thought this was odd too.</span><br><br><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Another reason I have a problem basing my actions off something Palkia thinks is a good idea.</span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">It would be worse play to lynch Palkia first rather than Elyse, if Palkia adheres to his GS guilty.</span><br><br><br>Please unvote so we don't lynch Elyse right now.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote></div></blockquote>"}

Something I don't like is the disappearance of Elyse, but that could just be a timing issue because the same could be said of Jake. We'll see how it all plays out.

You're now trying to make up for a rare slip that is made. Probably a lapse in judgement because you weren't really thinking about the game when you were out with friends.

The only real difference of opinion we have had since end of D1 is on Axe, However, she has done enough independently, such as deciding to vote Havoc D2 instead of Oversoul who I said I wanted to vote for (causing the bus to be unnecessary for a strategy of sheeping me), and the NK distribution including tonight does not seem to me like it would come from Elyse. <br><br>RC was a good kill.<br>BBT was a terrible kill, and I think a very unlikely candidate for PR hunting. He was likely killed because he said he wanted to lynch Elyse. This isn't actually a threat to Elyse and if I were her I would have killed Jake (if not partner).<br>Oversoul/me was a terrible kill. Scum were the only ones with confirmed knowledge of Oversoul's alignment. Everyone else was against him. This kill only benefits Reverend since he was actually the optimal kill. But, since I don't care about Reverend's alignment, I choose to believe that Oversoul was just a bad kill. I don't think Elyse would have made this mistake.<br><br>To be clear: Reverend if you are scum this game, you are being pathetic by paying absolutely no attention, accidentally posting content related to multiple other threads, etc... and this is not an acceptable strategy imo. I'm just going to continue to ignore the possibility.<br><br>The only thing Elyse has posted today that I really didn't like was: \"It is obviously not Palkia and me.\" I want to know, from her perspective, why this is true. I'm not going to provide my opinion on it until she answers that."}

Sure, Rev may not have been doing much but the sheer amount of people against at that point in the game was astonishing.
