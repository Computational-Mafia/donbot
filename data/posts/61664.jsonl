You may not quote your role PM, you may not quote any other PMs from me, and you may not quote the time at which I sent you any PM.<br>\n3. <div style=\"display:inline;color:indigo\">Indigo</div> is the colour I'll use to post vote counts, edit things into other people's posts, etc. Do not impersonate me.<br>\n4. If you have a question or concern, or if you think that I may have made an error, do not hesitate to ask in-topic or by pm. Be sure to bold requests directed at me so that I see them.<br>\n<br>\nVoting, Lynching, and Deadlines:<br>\n5. Votes must be bolded. Some mods require you to unvote before changing your vote; I do not.<br>\n6. A lynch requires a majority (over 50%) vote.<br>\n7. You may also vote for no lynch to happen on that day by typing Vote: No lynch. A no-lynch only requires a 50% vote to go through.<br>\n8. Each day will have a 14 day deadline. If you do not achieve a lynch before deadline, there will be no lynch.<br>\n<br>\nNight Phase and Actions:<br>\n9. The night phase will last for <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">72</div> 48 hours.<br>\n10. You may not use an ability on yourself unless otherwise specified.<br>\n11. If a limited-shot ability fails, the shot is still used, unless otherwise specified.<br>\n12. Night deadline might be extended if I need a replacement.<br>\n<br>\nProdding and Stuff:<br>\n13. If a player fails to post for 48 consecutive hours, he will be prodded. If that player does not post for another 24 hours after he's been prodded, he'll be replaced.<br>\n14. If you are going away, or if you have limited access to the site, notify me by pm or in-topic so that I know not to prod or replace you. If you're going to be V/LA over the night phase and have a night action, you may send in your action early. The maximum amount of time you may go without posting due to V/LA is 120 hours (five days).<br>\n<br>\nSample Role PM:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Vanilla Townie Role PM wrote:</cite>Greetings X!

How you follow up will decide where my read on you goes. Up till now, I haven't seen anything great come from your slot, and while others have done the same, you're one of the ones who's also seemingly active.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I understand that tells like that may not fully convince you that someone is scum, but you don't have to know that someone is scum to vote them. If they do something slightly scummy, and there hasn't been much else going on (aka start of the game), then you might as well vote them. I don't think tells have to convince you of anything, they just have to be scummy enough to deserve a vote and some pressure. TBH, I'm kinda getting off topic here. You simply said that they aren't fully alignment indicative, that's true, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't act on them.<br>\n<br>\nYeah, I saw your explanation, and I guess my question there is a bit of an empty one. However, it read to me as someone just bringing something up for the sake of having something to talk about, which is something scum loves to do because it hides the fact that they aren't really contributing anything. I might be able to cut you some slack if you're new to the mode or whatever, something about it still just strikes me as weird.<br>\n<br>\nI like your \"new\" line of reasoning for voting BBT more, but I really really don't like this line:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I know we're still in RVS but you can do better than looking for any possible waggon.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI'm glad you've shared your reads and such now, however I can't help but feel you are posting empty content, unwilling to commit to anything.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6821172#p6821172\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6821172#p6821172\" data-post-id=\"6821172\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 88</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25782\">Rune</a> wrote:</cite>I am wary of Brain's post 12, but this could very easily be a joke post on the first page, so I don't give too much thought to it immediately. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Empty, null read.

Even attempting to post a read of him reeks of just, well... trying too hard.<br>\n<br>\nWhen I originally read your posts, I almost changed my mind because they seemed logical and towny, but then I took a closer look, and honestly, they appear towny because you make some observations, but you don't commit to anything at all. I suppose I can't expect you to have heavy scum and town reads at this point, but saying something useful would be nice. Posting about null reads is useless. Useless posting. I would rather you have expanded on your one scum read, BBT. Why are you voting him exactly? You want to generate discussion? What a vague answer. Do you actually think he is scum? If so, provide more reason than your first post you voted him in. He's posted a lot since then, has he done more scummy things that require a vote?<br>\n<br>\nI think, I to, am happy where my vote is.", "time": "Thu Apr 30, 2015 5:55 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61664&start=75", "forum": "53", "thread": "61664"}

I will be scumhunting from the pool of the 12 other players in this game, not only the 3 or 4 who are active, and so I think it is important to hold people accountable for their post count, post length and quality (PB - really not doing a great job here), etc... and not let lurking slide.

It's based mostly on semantics. So, until I see BBT slip something, I'm happy with a town read, and will stand by that. - This ignoring the fact that I don't like his original couple of posts, but as I've mentioned I'm generally forgiving of very early posts and see that now as a difference in playstyle choice.<br>\n<br>\nI would like to see TDA post a bit more since I have a hard time believing his current posts come from a townie.<br>\n<br>\n@Axe  &amp; Elyse (and anyone else) - why the townread on RC so far?

I don't like that all of a sudden you realize how little PB has posted and hop onto a really convenient wagon that's been there for a while. 11 posts in the firsts three pages, 1 in page 4, and 1 later. The first few are game-related but if a player's contributions are almost exlcusively p1 or p2, something is seriously off. Several players have called him out, you should have seen this earlier. I don't mind your vote only coming now as much, but you should have realized the behaviour existed.<br>\n<br>\nYou then agree with me that the posting styles of me and PB are really not fairly comparable, which makes me think you could have been trying to be opportunistic beforehand, and took the obvious out when I called you out for it.<br>\n<br>\nMost importantly, you have basically decided to sit on a big PB fence and vote for him, which you've essentially been vocally upset at me for allegedly doing, which you even mentioned in that post. I feel like this, alongside with the fact that if you missed PB's behaviour earlier, you've probably still got a lot of other things to catch up on, make me very suspicious of the rest of the content you've posted.<br>\n<br>\nThe amount of lurking is something else that I've mentioned several times, and I mean SEVERAL. As early as page 5 (post 120), post 169, and post 192 are all examples of me making it very clear that not everyone is contributing and it is entirely possible we have tvt going on. I have used many of my posts to call people out to ask them to be more detailed in their posts (TDA, RC) or to post more (Jake) (probably others).<br>\n<br>\nMy real difficulty here is that I agree with most of your post. PB would be playing a really weak scum if he actually scum flips. There are too many lurkers. It just seems like your post is designed to feel organic and original but in fact agrees with a lot that I've been saying without explicitly mentioning it, and shows that you've been to this point selectively looking at specific posts and ignoring others before posting. That seems more scum than town.<br>\n<br>\nugh there's just so much there that has been obvious for ages, and it shows you didn't really look before comparing me to PB, as you've obviously completely changed your stance. <br>\n<br>\nConvince me I'm wrong.

I don't like that all of a sudden you realize how little PB has posted and hop onto a really convenient wagon that's been there for a while. 11 posts in the firsts three pages, 1 in page 4, and 1 later. The first few are game-related but if a player's contributions are almost exlcusively p1 or p2, something is seriously off. Several players have called him out, you should have seen this earlier. I don't mind your vote only coming now as much, but you should have realized the behaviour existed.<br>\n<br>\nYou then agree with me that the posting styles of me and PB are really not fairly comparable, which makes me think you could have been trying to be opportunistic beforehand, and took the obvious out when I called you out for it.<br>\n<br>\nMost importantly, you have basically decided to sit on a big PB fence and vote for him, which you've essentially been vocally upset at me for allegedly doing, which you even mentioned in that post. I feel like this, alongside with the fact that if you missed PB's behaviour earlier, you've probably still got a lot of other things to catch up on, make me very suspicious of the rest of the content you've posted.<br>\n<br>\nThe amount of lurking is something else that I've mentioned several times, and I mean SEVERAL. As early as page 5 (post 120), post 169, and post 192 are all examples of me making it very clear that not everyone is contributing and it is entirely possible we have tvt going on. I have used many of my posts to call people out to ask them to be more detailed in their posts (TDA, RC) or to post more (Jake) (probably others).<br>\n<br>\nMy real difficulty here is that I agree with most of your post. PB would be playing a really weak scum if he actually scum flips. There are too many lurkers. It just seems like your post is designed to feel organic and original but in fact agrees with a lot that I've been saying without explicitly mentioning it, and shows that you've been to this point selectively looking at specific posts and ignoring others before posting. That seems more scum than town.<br>\n<br>\nugh there's just so much there that has been obvious for ages, and it shows you didn't really look before comparing me to PB, as you've obviously completely changed your stance. <br>\n<br>\nConvince me I'm wrong. I'll let you know if my second impression feels better than my first, but those are my thoughts.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI never said it was post 222 that started it. You've been acting better for a while now. When I originally put my vote on you, I wanted to see how you would contribute in the future and how you would react to my questions, since there wasn't much there at the time. I thought you delivered quite well, which cancels my case completely. Since my case is simply the fact that you weren't posting well.<br>\n<br>\nYou're right in the fact I didn't really look.

I just think it's relevant to point out.<br>\n<br>\nMy read on you would change to neutral if you hadn't posted today because you have exactly 6 posts to this point, none of which have given me a scumread (in fact, the opposite). But if I can't trust you to post when you say you will post when you have almost no posts to begin with, I refuse to reward you with a townread. Obviously if you came back tomorrow and gave a reasonable excuse for not posting when you said you would and I believed you, that would be ok too.<br>\n<br>\nUpon reflection I'm not sure I explained how my reads were meant to be read well enough. I labeled the last section as \"townish\" not \"town\" and specified at the end that I really am looking at D1 lynch candidates. I mentioned several times beforehand my reluctance to scumread Rev, but if he was going to blatantly manipulate my words like that, it seemed like an easy tell. However, I think it is perfectly plausible that he just made a mistake, since he owned up to it really quickly as you mentioned. Since in general his playstyle here is wildly aggressive and without great logic (as evidenced by his admitting that he has blinders for arceus despite the obvious ridiculousness of his posts against me), I think it isn't too hard to imagine this is a mistake he could have realistically made. That being said, it is also possible he is hiding as scum behind poor town play, but I don't think he is a good D1 lynch candidate at all, so I'd rather put him borderline town.<br>\n<br>\nYou'll also notice that my neutral reads are really people who I don't have a read on (I did specify it was largely a category for people who I had little or no information on). It might have been appropriate to put them in a separate section instead of in the middle between scum and town (I did that to keep convention, but I expected the meaning to be clear based on the people in it)<br>\n<br>\nI really like my top 3 scumreads though right now, and I like the order that they are in. Generally I don't like to commit to associative reads D1 but Arceus jumping in so soon after Dan scumslips and replaces out really seems to me to be his way of trying to bring the attention off of Dan/Palkia, by attacking me without having to defend Dan and thus he thinks he will avoid showing his association. Otherwise, it would have been optimal for Arceus to simply lie low, which would have been easy. I think Palkia's annoying play right now gives absolutely no reason to consider any other lynch candidate without strong evidence. You probably stand a decent chance of convincing me that Arceus is a good lynch, and I'll definitely consider it, but I'm hoping that his posts improve quickly or at least make more contextual sense.<br>\n<br>\n@Rev<br>\n<br>\nCan you see why this could hurt the town? Just because someone agrees with your points, doesn't make them town. Just because they disagree, doesn't make them scum. Arceus' argument is poor, regardless of my alignment. Admitting the possibility of having blinkers on makes me sad, because it is an easy way for you to avoid being read. It is definitely not pro-town to have 'blinkers'.<br>\n<br>\nYou're right that our exchange does not make me town. Your 'derp' should reflect poorly on the town's perception of you, not positively on its perception of me. So I think you missed the point there.", "time": "Sun May 03, 2015 4:36 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61664&start=325", "forum": "53", "thread": "61664"}

I understand what you're saying, but that's more of a newb thing than a scum thing. In a game that just finished (RC and TDA can attest to this), I ran up (as scum) Taly, a new player who basically townread and scumread people based solely on their interactions with him. Rune isn't doing this, but it's a similar argument.<br>\n<br>\n@Rune<br>\nI only mentioned the ongoing game thing because it might be against site rules.

Can you make your own case against me?<br>\n<br>\n3) You reference Arceus' 'argument' against me, which has already been discussed and in my opinion is good for nothing better than an easy scum read and lining a digital recycling bin. It is obvious that Arceus has read only half the game, noting that all three of the posts you quoted were actually quotes of me in the first few pages. Not only that, but the points Arceus makes are extremely weak, and I already responded to them in full. Again, what is your own case against me, and how does it differ from these weak points which I've addressed?<br>\n<br>\n4) Given your town read on Elyse, what do you think of her opinion on Arceus, particularly her agreement with me that the argument by Arceus against me was really poor.<br>\n<br>\n5) The second half of your Elyse townread doesn't make sense to me. It seems like filler.<br>\n<br>\n6) I think your towncase for BBT is really odd. It really just looks like you are trying to use it to further an argument against me, yet another one which does not hold up. How can you mention that a player seems to think they have found the entire scumteam without mentioning Reverend, who has been making pretty strong associative scumreads since the first couple pages of the game? I think it is pretty obvious that RC has already responded to that question with her vote. Additionally, RC has recently made comments about me which should have helped you see that that question isn't really applicable right now.<br>\n<br>\n7) We had pretty similar thoughts on Axe's post. It rubs me the wrong way that you don't seem to be producing any original content or analysis in your reads.<br>\n<br>\n8) Your scumcase against PB has gone from \"duh\" to \"I haven't changed my mind\". Can you describe your original case in more detail?<br>\n<br>\n9) Your reads have barely changed at all since 241 (you've added a not-as-towny category where you've added Axehole and Arceus, and conveniently backed off your weak Rune/RC argument as scum by putting RC here).

Steep drop in good content from yesterday. <br>\n<br>\nre: Paranoia - understandable. I just find it interesting that you are already going to such great lengths to begin building a scum team with me at the center. It assumes that I am a good scum player (I'm not) and the team would defer to my judgment (probably wouldn't), and it just flat out assumes that I am scum (I'm not). Back when I played a lot of games I would construct teams based on a single person, watching their interactions with those people, etc. Unfortunately, more often than not I was wrong about the central person that I used to anchor my reads, so I would be dejected with the game and my ability and just play shitty once that person flipped town or something.<br>\n<br>\nIn a way, I did that with PB and Elyse.

I did notice his use of random names and assumed they were nicknames or that he was just confused as he had been earlier, but I'll take your word for it that they represent other games he is playing.

There is an obvious scum motivation for moving the wagon to PB. I don't think there is a town motivation for the tail end of the PB wagon. This makes me very convinced that Havoc is scum.<br>\n<br>\nWhy should I let my oversoul scumread go? Nothing has been posted that makes me confident he is town.<br>\n<br>\nJust because no one is defending Havoc doesn't mean he is town.

Trying to absolve yourself from any blame by saying you couldn't predict what HI and Palkia do makes you even scummier. Sure, you didn't hammer him, but you shifted the phase from what looked to be a Havoc lynch to a PB lynch, whether you admit to it or not. You gave Palkia the gun and he shot it at PB. My job is to figure out which one of you if any, is scum.

I'd point out that said wagon is exactly the wagon on Elyse right now. If you disagree, please do your best to explain it, because this is obviously a sore point for me. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Yes, I think we can agree on that. I don't think both scum were on the PB counter wagon though.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">So we agree, that assuming you are town, either Hostile or Palkia are scum? I agree it is probable that there is one scum on the counter wagon.</div><br>\n<br>\n2. What do you think about HI townreading both you and Palkia given my above statement? <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I think she could be scum. I think she might be trying to stall a claim. I wish Palkia would stop being a lurker and definitively say he has a guilty on Elyse, otherwise I will lynch HI.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Palkia being a lurker is a huge problem and I really don't trust him enough to base my actions at this point on his posts. Until that changes, I believe we have enough information available to the whole town to do a good job at hunting scum independently of Palkia.</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n3. Right now, who would you be willing to lynch? What information you would get from those flips?<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I am willing to lynch Elyse, Jake, HI, Palkia. My preferences may change. Elyse would give us information on Palkia. Palkia would also give us some associative tells. HI + Jake because I really dislike their play so far, not entirely sure what can be gleamed from HI given her iso. Jake probably would give us some associative tells too.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Jake's play today has been really subpar. I understand the town motivation for this lynch. However, I really don't think it is optimal, although I haven't ISO'd him and no immediate associatives come to mind except weak pushes on Palkia. Either way, I would rank Jake as the lowest priority of the four you mentioned. My problem with GS Guilty lynch is that I don't trust Palkia, and I don't necessarily trust Elyse's VT claim. I don't think that a flip on either of these players gives DEFINITIVE information, at least from my perspective. I think we have options which will give definitive information. For example, I am quite confident that you (oversoul) and HI are opposite alignments.</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nDo you agree we are probably look at a 10-3 setup (I don't think Havoc was operating independently)? In this case, which pairs do you think are the remainder of the team with Havoc? <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Yes. The norm on MS is for games to be 10:3.

I'd point out that said wagon is exactly the wagon on Elyse right now. If you disagree, please do your best to explain it, because this is obviously a sore point for me. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Yes, I think we can agree on that. I don't think both scum were on the PB counter wagon though.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">So we agree, that assuming you are town, either Hostile or Palkia are scum? I agree it is probable that there is one scum on the counter wagon.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Yes. I think that either Hostile or Palkia are scum. This is going into my pairings that I don't want to reveal though.</div><br>\n<br>\n2. What do you think about HI townreading both you and Palkia given my above statement? <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I think she could be scum. I think she might be trying to stall a claim. I wish Palkia would stop being a lurker and definitively say he has a guilty on Elyse, otherwise I will lynch HI.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Palkia being a lurker is a huge problem and I really don't trust him enough to base my actions at this point on his posts. Until that changes, I believe we have enough information available to the whole town to do a good job at hunting scum independently of Palkia.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I agree. I want him to confirm or deny his guilty and then proceed to lynch based on that information. I agree we probably information outside of Palkia to come to a consensus. I'm not entirely sure where that consensus should be. I am thinking within {Jake, Rev, Saint}.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n3. Right now, who would you be willing to lynch? What information you would get from those flips?<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I am willing to lynch Elyse, Jake, HI, Palkia. My preferences may change. Elyse would give us information on Palkia. Palkia would also give us some associative tells. HI + Jake because I really dislike their play so far, not entirely sure what can be gleamed from HI given her iso. Jake probably would give us some associative tells too.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Jake's play today has been really subpar. I understand the town motivation for this lynch. However, I really don't think it is optimal, although I haven't ISO'd him and no immediate associatives come to mind except weak pushes on Palkia. Either way, I would rank Jake as the lowest priority of the four you mentioned. My problem with GS Guilty lynch is that I don't trust Palkia, and I don't necessarily trust Elyse's VT claim. I don't think that a flip on either of these players gives DEFINITIVE information, at least from my perspective. I think we have options which will give definitive information. For example, I am quite confident that you (oversoul) and HI are opposite alignments.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">You think Elyse is lying about her claim? I don't.<br>\nI think an Elyse townflip definitively points to a Palkia-scum.</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nDo you agree we are probably look at a 10-3 setup (I don't think Havoc was operating independently)? In this case, which pairs do you think are the remainder of the team with Havoc? <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Yes. The norm on MS is for games to be 10:3. I dunno who the pairs are yet. Need more information. I have a couple of speculations maybe, but I don't want to reveal them just yet. </div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">That is fair. When you feel like bringing up possibilities, let me know. I think either today or D4 we are ready to put forward more information, such as this.</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nOut of curiosity, am I the only one who noticed that Palkia didn't regret the lynch of PB (who flipped town) but immediately posted 'regret' on the hammer of Havoc (who then flipped scum). I didn't mention this earlier but I thought it was odd.<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Yes, I saw this. Yes, I thought this was odd too.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Another reason I have a problem basing my actions off something Palkia thinks is a good idea.</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">It would be worse play to lynch Palkia first rather than Elyse, if Palkia adheres to his GS guilty.</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nPlease unvote so we don't lynch Elyse right now.</div></div></blockquote></div></blockquote></div></blockquote>", "time": "Sun May 17, 2015 4:34 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61664&start=1325", "forum": "53", "thread": "61664"}

That's why my sheep vote is there. Again, we didn't know we were building a counterwagon and, without further evidence, we can't know for sure that we didn't have two scum wagons going simultaneously. You and I play two very different games. I'm not nearly as paranoid as you are and I've been given no inclination to suspect you're not town. If Rune ends up flipping town, then yeah you look fucking horrible.

The only real difference of opinion we have had since end of D1 is on Axe, However, she has done enough independently, such as deciding to vote Havoc D2 instead of Oversoul who I said I wanted to vote for (causing the bus to be unnecessary for a strategy of sheeping me), and the NK distribution including tonight does not seem to me like it would come from Elyse. <br>\n<br>\nRC was a good kill.<br>\nBBT was a terrible kill, and I think a very unlikely candidate for PR hunting. He was likely killed because he said he wanted to lynch Elyse. This isn't actually a threat to Elyse and if I were her I would have killed Jake (if not partner).<br>\nOversoul/me was a terrible kill. Scum were the only ones with confirmed knowledge of Oversoul's alignment. Everyone else was against him. This kill only benefits Reverend since he was actually the optimal kill. But, since I don't care about Reverend's alignment, I choose to believe that Oversoul was just a bad kill. I don't think Elyse would have made this mistake.<br>\n<br>\nTo be clear: Reverend if you are scum this game, you are being pathetic by paying absolutely no attention, accidentally posting content related to multiple other threads, etc... and this is not an acceptable strategy imo. I'm just going to continue to ignore the possibility.<br>\n<br>\nThe only thing Elyse has posted today that I really didn't like was: \"It is obviously not Palkia and me.\" I want to know, from her perspective, why this is true.

If it isn't an obvious crumb, then if you claimed another role nobody would refer to the crumb to contradict you... so all it shows is that you planned to claim that specific role, but only after you claim and show everyone it was there in the first place. I see absolutely no advantage to town in doing this.<br>\n<br>\nI also think you could have been a lot more subtle about asking for townreads at the end of D2. <br>\n<br>\nBut yeah, all in all as I mentioned I exaggerated my read on you quite a bit to keep scum off my back. (I did still think there was a solid chance you were scum, I'm not backing off of that). Even though it looked like I was tunnelling on you, I was also exploring other options.<br>\n<br>\nJake showed scum clearly on D3 and today, and either he or Palkia would have been the correct shot from Hostile (even though Hostile should never have been in that situation in the first place, and Axe and Palkia should never have fake claimed). I don't think Saint was a good target for HI.<br>\n<br>\nTbh I don't think Elyse played poorly as scum at all. I think her tell was mainly that she was obviously trying way harder than her posting indicated. She may have sheeped me just a little bit too much, but it's an easy thing to do when it involves comments on suboptimal play.

I simply intercepted the kill. So, take that for what you will. Anyway, with that information in mind...<br>\n<br>\nI agree with you almost 100%. As a mafia member, I would have never attempted to kill Oversoul outright or Rune outright. I would have settled for Rev hoping to get the mislynch on Oversoul. Sure, Rev may not have been doing much but the sheer amount of people against at that point in the game was astonishing. Axe at any point in the game would have been a very bad kill (sorry Axe but you were trolling so a net positive for the mafia). Hell, I would have even killed Palkia to make sure Elyse was safer during the day.<br>\n<br>\nAs Oversoul the bodyguard, I was *so* close to protecting Reverend for literally the same exact thinking haha. I almost submitted the Rev protection that night but I am glad I did not in the end. I was going for a super high level meta protection on Rev predicting scum to behave the exact same way that you thought they should behave.<br>\n<br>\nI find it so interesting that you and I had very similar thoughts during the game despite you eating my dick all game  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol2.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\"> (even if it was trumped up to protect yourself)<br>\n<br>\nI don't necessarily agree with that by the way. By trumping up your read on me, and potentially accurately catching another one or two members of the mafia team, like you did with Havoc, could have implicitly framed me which would not have been good.<br>\n<br>\nI do like your style of play. Reminds me of other good players like Fate, AngryPidgeon, Faraday, etc. I hope you do stay! The general quality of games is something of a hit or miss nowadays, but if you selectively choose which games to play in, you might have a better time.<br>\n<br>\nI can't in good faith justify the double target on Axe. I could have excused Roleblock into a Cop investigation, but Cop into a Roleblock was sloppy, especially since we only had one flipped mafia at that point.
