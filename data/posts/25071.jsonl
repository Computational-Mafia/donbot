Specific ones to mention are play to your win condition, no complex codes, and do not heavily insult another person in this game (insulting a play style is one thing, but being very harsh to a person isn\u2019t allowed).</li><li>Do not quote your role pm. Paraphrasing is fine.</li><li>Do not quote any other mod communications. Paraphrasing is again fine. If you have a qt then while you still can\u2019t quote anything I say in it, any of your comments are allowed to be quoted.</li><li>Day 1 lasts a maximum two weeks. All days after that last a maximum of 10 days.</li><li>Night phases last 48 hours.</li><li>You will be prodded after 48 hours of inactivity and replaced after an additional 24 hours of not replying to a prod. You will be immediately replaced if you get three prods. You may ask me to prod a player if they\u2019ve already gone 36 hours without posting and I haven\u2019t done it yet.</li><li>If you go on V/LA pm me or announce it in thread. I\u2019ll count it anyway if you just put the V/LA banner on, but it\u2019s preferable to mention it to me. </li><li>Put votes in bold or use vote tags with the format vote: user (or no lynch if desired). If it looks like a vote, but the format is off then I\u2019ll still count it.</li><li>A player will be lynched at majority. A no lynch requires half of the people alive to vote no lynch.. Everyone that is alive (including the lynchee if a lynch occurs) is allowed to keep on talking during twilight.</li><li>A no lynch will occur at deadline if there is no majority by then.</li><li>Blue is my color. Do not use it. Any other color is allowed to use if desired. Do not impersonate the mod in any way. The only person besides me who can mod this game is my back up mod, RichardGHP.</li><li>I have permission to edit these rules or add anything else that I deem to be missing. Use common sense when playing and ask me if what you\u2019re going to do feels a bit against the rules.</li><li>Rules are fairly short and concise, but finally do remember to enjoy the game as well.</li></ol><br>Lastly this is what the town vanilla role pm looks like:</span></span></span><br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase; margin:0px 0.6em; padding:0em 0.33em\">Town - Vanilla</legend>Active Powers<ul><li>None</li></ul>Passive Powers<ul><li>None</li></ul><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Win Condition: You win when all players who have a win condition that interferes with your own are dead.</span></fieldset><br><br>Confirm in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=25071&amp;p=4634745#p4634745\" class=\"postlink\">thread</a>.

Monkeyman never made a single positive claim about whether scum can talk during QT, daytalk, night, whatever.  He made no positive statement at all, but asked a question.

So Yates's accusation was based on either a misread or malice.  <br><br>In my limited experience scum is more likely to jump on wagons than to start them, so my question is, who jumped on this CLEARLY erroneous bandwagon?  How did people react?<br><br>In post #65, -L- was skeptical.<br>In post #67 Matt-Shadowlord seemed confused but thought it might be a plausible line of inquiry.<br>In post #68, havingfitz voted for Monkeyman, claiming that Yates \"beat him to it\"<br>In post #71 Alduskkel voted for Monkeyman with no explanation<br>In post #74 Yates posts \"evidence\" that shows that Monkeyman definitely knows that scum can talk N0.  But the fact remains that Monkeyman never claimed that such a thing was impossible.<br>In post #75 Matt-Shadowlord buys it and votes Monkeyman<br>In post #80, Human Destroyer jumps on the wagon with the comment \"this is a good wagon\"<br><br>On the next page, Yates seems to be suffering from extreme tunnelvision.  I agree with -L-'s comment in #135 and its implication that this is more likely to be a townie trait than a scum trait.<br><br>In post #132, havingfitz unvotes Monkeyman without reason given.<br>In #140 TheActingMethod \"doesn't get\" the bandwagon<br><br>----<br><br>The one thing I'm really uncomfortable with here is that my number one suspect after first re-read was havingfitz, and I don't think scum would jump off the wagon at that point (unless Monkeyman were actually scum).<br><br>So I have two options: Monkey/Fitz scumteam, or Option 2.  Option 2 is that Monkey is town and  Alduskkel, Matt, or HD (but not all) are scum opportunistically hopping on wagons. <br><br>Monkey just doesn't read scum to me, especially after reading him in isolation in the game Yates posted.

I wanted to know why you are so \"jumpy\" because the message - to an impartial observer - was clearly directed towards Slandaar.  The fact that you thought the post needed clarification?  It looked like you were concerned the post was directed at you.  That's paranoia.  For someone with no pressure on them [yet] paranoia is pretty scummy this early in the game.<br><br>So we have a Monkey/L scum team so far.  I wonder who else is going to out themselves.<br><br>PE: <br>@CS - the only \"nonsense\" is your characterization of my Monkey case as \"nonsense.\"<br>@L - Your post is one of the scummiest posts I've seen ON SITE - not just in the thread.  While I don't necessarily make my Town reads known unless needed, my scum reads are always put out there with reason.  Anyone that doesn't do one of the two is not playing towards a Town win condition.<br>@Monkey - It's not a stretch.  \"Lynch all Lurkers\" is absolutely a policy.  The fact it isn't in a wiki doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  I would point you towards the scene in \"A Few Good Men\" where Kaffee asks Cpl Barnes to point out the mess hall in the \"Marine Outline for Recruit Training,\" but I thought that might be overkill.<br><br>On second thought...<br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Capt.

Anyone that has been on this site for a while and that has been given a scum role would know how scum QT's work.  Monkey is a site veteran and, as he has admitted, would absolutely know this.  So, I am presented with a scenario in which a site veteran makes a post where he questions how QT's work and how not starting the day [by not confirming roles] helps to extend the scum QT.  For someone like Monkey?  This comes off as disingenuous.  You can choose to believe that he was simply \"confused\" as to whether or not the day had started, as he alleges, or you can believe as I do that this is his way of back tracking on a gambit that blew up in his face.<br><br>I am just now realizing how few experienced players there are on this player list.  Slandaar and Monkey are people I have played with in the past and that I am confident should know better.  I simply can't see Monkey \"forgetting\" we were still in twilight when Fritz made his post that started this chain of events."}

I don't think that scum is necessarily more self-conscious about looking bad.  As a townie, I'm just as concerned about throwing off false scum-tells as not.  I'd rather not be voted ever, at all, in any game.  Therefore I'm not prepared to look at HD's concern for his appearance in #50 as a scum tell.<br><br>On the other hand, I share his disagreement with HD's conclusion that should MM flip scum, Slandaar falls under heavy suspicion.  Based on Slandaar's posting, I don't think there's a good chance that if MM flips scum that Slandaar is also scum.  Scum isn't often going to defend scum on day 1 in the face of a growing wagon.  Rather, scum would buddy up with a townie under fire, making Slandaar a weak scum possibility in a universe where MM flips town.  It would be a good play for potential Slandaar-scum, building him an ally if Monkey is not lynched and making him look better when Monkey flips town.<br><br>With that in mind I re-read Slandaar in isolation.  Barring his last post I'm getting strong scum vibes from him.  He voted HD during RVS and is sitting on the wagon.  He hasn't done any real scumhunting and has posted mostly non-content.

I don't think that scum is necessarily more self-conscious about looking bad.  As a townie, I'm just as concerned about throwing off false scum-tells as not.

Therefore I'm not prepared to look at HD's concern for his appearance in #50 as a scum tell.<br><br>On the other hand, I share his disagreement with HD's conclusion that should MM flip scum, Slandaar falls under heavy suspicion.  Based on Slandaar's posting, I don't think there's a good chance that if MM flips scum that Slandaar is also scum.  Scum isn't often going to defend scum on day 1 in the face of a growing wagon.  Rather, scum would buddy up with a townie under fire, making Slandaar a weak scum possibility in a universe where MM flips town.  It would be a good play for potential Slandaar-scum, building him an ally if Monkey is not lynched and making him look better when Monkey flips town.<br><br>With that in mind I re-read Slandaar in isolation.  Barring his last post I'm getting strong scum vibes from him.  He voted HD during RVS and is sitting on the wagon.  He hasn't done any real scumhunting and has posted mostly non-content.

This is even worded scummy.<br><br>\"Working on a list of names\" - you don't have a couple of suspects? These are the words of a scum who will pick and choose his fights based on who he think he can get lynched. This is why I dislike town sharing their town reads - because if several people believe an individual is town, a scum will unwittingly attack that player - outing himself. Sharing town reads enables the scum to separate targets into safe/unsafe buckets. Which is what Matt is probably doing now. I bet two or three of his suspects will be lurker a, ignoring the active people.<br><br>\"Thoughts to put beside them\" - this is also worded scummy. It smacks of fabrication.

If day has started I don't know how they could be \"extending their chat.\"<br><br>Yates: \"With a join date of November 7, 2008 - why are you pretending you don't know that scum get to chat prior to the start of the day?<br>Vote: MonkeyMan576<br>Out of RVS - scum found.\"<br><br>MonkeyMan576 \"This is about the stupidest case I've ever heard.

I never even implied that scum couldn't chat pregame.\"<br><br>I was convinced by Yates arguement that MM was certainly well placed to know the chat rules, and that making a statement that subtly implied that he didn't know what chat rules those darn stinkin' mafioso were playing by was just a way to start putting a case for his own innocence into people's minds.

(Note that might sometimes be the case on mafiascum but it's a completely new rule to me; I've never played a game where mafia couldn't chat all the time. Is this common?). <br>It took several readings, but Monkey did not imply that scum couldn't chat pregame as Yates said, but instead that since they either can chat all the time or only at night, either way they'd not extend their chat after day started. They can either chat anyway, or wouldn't be able to chat in daytime so gain nothing from extending day.<br><br>So, sorry Yates, you probably need to go back and re-read that and re-evaluate and see what you think.<br><br>The issue then is that I tried to track down a different argument against Monkey and can't really find one.

You <span style=\"font-style: italic\">haven't</span> made a case, nevermind a <br>\"substantial\" case.  Your inability to support your read on a rapidly forming wagon is SUPER scummy as it creates a logical distance from my flip.  By not commiting to your read you are attempting to fabricate a scenario in which your defense for the mislynch is simply \"well it isn't scummy to be wrong,\" rather than to have your evidence scrutinized later.  <br><br>This, incidentally, is something ace is guilty of as well but he has his own section in this post.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4645967#p4645967\" class=\"postlink\">post 420</a>, Slandaar wrote:</cite>He literally admits he didn't try to read me when he was an SK</div></blockquote><br>Already addressed.  You are faking a conclusion that is not accurate.  You are also faking a read on the game where you \"caught scum\" day 1.  If you were so hyper obvious Town, how did you make it to lylo?  Everyone here knows scum only bring the people they want to lylo and you were the one.  Maybe it had to do with your bad reads or the three other Townies you helped them lynch?<br><br>Since it is useless to make it your word against mine, here are some snippets from the <a href=\"http://www.quicktopic.com/47/H/tHcinY336nM\" class=\"postlink\">scum QT</a> to show you how worried THEY were about you:<br>\"26 - Slandaar can still be lynched, particularly for protecting me.\"<br>\"27 - I'll get Pidgey, Implo, or Slandaar lynched tomorrow\"<br>\"31 - Slandaar and pidgey are lynchable.\"<br><br>Bottom line, you are clearly not capable of objectively reading yourself so you can not possibly pretend to know how others would read you. The scum in the game you claim you were obvTown in thought you posted scummy enough to be a mislynch.  So that eaily supports my assertion that I read you as scum in that game.

I have unvoted and removed my accusation after looking into the root of it more closely. I haven't reached the conclusion he is town, but definitely can't be convinced he isn't based on the original alleged 'slip up'. I am satisfied and I won't vote against him again based on that, and I am a little surprised Yates hasn't also removed that original accusation.<br>Phrased as a question: Yates, do you still think that was a mafia slip up, or are you maintaining your vote vs Monkey for another different reason?<br><br>Ironically shortly after I reached the conclusion above and unvoted, Alduskkel and ArcAngel9 voted against Monkeyman, saving that wagon from falling apart.<br><br>My secondary suspect is Alduskkel; the reason is because I've seen people who's posts dry up when the game starts to sometimes be mafia, and at that time I believe he had 4 pre-game posts and only 6 in the 16 pages of this thread.<br>After being asked by Qwints for a scum read he accused MM.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@qwints: Yes, since I last posted I have developed a scum read.<br>Monkeyman is scum. Not because of anything Yates has said (that case is still crap), but because MM is riding the wave of \"Yates is scum\" that has become popular. MM basically puts in no effort to push Yates-scum; he doesn't construct a case, just realizes on a sentence or two and, more importantly, crediting others and their cases. Convenient for not taking the blame if/when Yates flips town. Additionally, posts such as 325 and 415 to me read that MM doesn't actually care too much if Yates is town or scum, just that Yates \"won't listen to reason\" and so he should be lynched on those grounds -- which is the kind of approach to a lynch that scum would have. (Town want to lynch scum, not VIs...) Vote: Monkeyman</div></blockquote><br><br>It's common for townies to vote vs their accusers, and it's common for townies to immediately assume their accuser is more likely to be guilty (whether OMGUS, or subconsciously or defensively, it's common to vote against an accuser), so the argument above is convincing that MM could be voting vs Yates for a personal/vindictive reason, but not that he's mafia.<br><br>So I am not convinced by the reasoning behind his vote vs Monkeyman, and I have not lowered my suspicion of Alduskkel. <br>It is nice to see him join in more though <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"><br><br>Monkeyman himself says <br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4646007#p4646007\" class=\"postlink\">post 424</a>, MonkeyMan576 wrote:</cite>I am voting Yates because I think he is scummy, not because \"I know what he is.\"   I'm willing to listen to TownYates arguments, but right now Yates is playing like scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>Which I don't agree with, I think Yates is playing enthusiastically town-style with a bit of tunnel vision, but that Mafia don't want to win a lynch on day 1 enough to do the sort of 1 for 1 swap this high profile pursuit can become."}

I thought [and continue to think] it was a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">fake</span> slip/gambit.  However, while that is what turned me on to Monkey in the first place, that is only part of the reason I'm maintaining my vote on Monkey.  The fact of the matter is that he has not satisfactorily addressed my concern that *I* believe he intended for that to be a fake Town slip, got caught, then weakly tried to defend it by pretending he didn't know day had started.  I will admit that at this point that would be a lot to ask of him.  Call it a \"tunnel\" if you want but I find it hugely suspicious that it took him TWELVE posts to come up with the \"Okay, I see the confusion\" post.  Not enough to make him scum on it's own, granted, but a major indicator - much like a slow claim or botched claim.<br><br>What I find more fascinating about Monkey, and something I have been waiting for someone else to point out, is that he claims one of the biggest reasons he voted me had to do with my \"omgusy\" play.  The irony here is that he claims to have multiple reasons for voting me yet is unable to articulate a single alignment indicative tell - which basically translates his vote as nothing more than omgus for not letting up on him, not unvoting him, and forcing him to answer for his actions and claims.  Again, OMGUS isn't an actual scum tell.  However, if you are going to accuse someone of being scum for omgus reasons, you better not be doing it yourself.  Monkey, in my opinion, is and that is hypocritical.  Hypocrites are scummy.<br><br>Also of note is that Monkey's meager attempts at putting something together that resembled a case on me was to parrot, quote others, and in general distance himself as much as possible from the repercussions of a Yates Town flip.  <br>Take a look at these posts from Monkey's ISO: 325, 331, 342, 369, 377, 415, 438<br>Every time he calls me scummy, he hedges by either directly quoting someone else or by pointing out that other people think this way too.  By not offering his own content or case, he can divorce himself of culpability by simply pointing out that others thought the same thing so \"oops I guess we were wrong, guys\" and let's move on to the next mislynch.  That's actually a very strong scum indicator as scum <span style=\"font-style: italic\">typically</span> want to be able to hold someone <span style=\"font-style: italic\">else</span> accountable for a mislynch.  That's a tough trick to pull off if you are the conductor on the train.  When you are riding in the caboose [or more appropriately - coal car], like Monkey, you find yourself perfectly positioned.<br><br>Obviously, a lot of my case on Monkey has to do with confirmation bias so it would be difficult for me to convince others to join the Monkey wagon based on some of these tells.  However, I have always intended to make this post.  I just needed to give Monkey opportunity to prove me wrong because I clearly don't have a smoking gun - just MAJOR suspicion.<br><br>Suffice it to say that from my perspective my Monkey vote is clearly about MUCH more than a fake slip."}

I pretended I didn't realize Pappums Rat was dead and *I* was the one who killed him!  If Tammy had stuck to her instincts and gotten a Yates lynch, she might have survived and Town likely would have won.

That's the whole post.  I caught flak for pointing out that Monkey is not a noob earlier in this day period - the whole point of pointing out his experience is that anyone that has been on this site as long as he has [longer than me, to be sure] *should have* read that as scum extending pre-dawn.  There would be no reason for him to assume Fitz was referring to day chat.  In fact, that assertion doesn't even make sense in context as day chat would be an ongoing thing regardless of when people confirmed in.  In fact, the ONLY way retarding confirmation could possibly help scum would be by extending night chat during the pre-dawn period.<br><br>So I guess what I'm saying is that Monkey's defense, the one you are currently using to clear him, doesn't even make SENSE."}

I think if he is scum he's making a pretty interesting play  If he's still around in a couple of days I may have to reassess... he seems like a good player and thus maybe capable of such a gambit. However, on D1 I'm not willing to lynch him against my read on the basis that he's running a gambit.<br><br>On to your question. In the game of mafia lynching serves a twofold purpose -- one is to get rid of scum, and the other is to get information for subsequent lynches. Therefore, my ideal lynch candidate is a person that both has a high probability of being scum and gives me information about who his compatriots might be. If we had absolutely confirmed scum or a candidate that is vastly superior to all others, I would vote to lynch them even if they provided zero information that would help us in subsequent days.  But we don't have that here.  I don't see anyone who I would rate as being HIGHLY probable scum, only people that I think have a pretty good chance.  And so I would support lynching one of them that would give us more information about the alignment of other players.  Yates just doesn't do that.  Despite posting a ton, he's basically been on Monkey the entire game and while he has posted regarding some other wagons, he hasn't done much and hasn't provided much real analysis.  Even if he flips scum, which I think is low possibility, his flip tells us nothing.  Was he bussing Monkey?  Who did he speak to and who did he ignore?  We might be able to puzzle some of these out from the walls that he's posted, but I would rather just lynch someone else because, as I said initially, I just don't buy him as scum.<br><br>I almost talked myself into a Monkey lynch earlier today simply because it would force Yates to shift his gaze to other targets, but that just wasn't a good enough reason for me to lynch Monkey unless we were having real trouble reaching a majority on a better lynch.<br><br>P-edit: I did read your town play in another game -L-, and you seemed much more into hunting and less into reacting to others.  That was my impression.<br><br>P-edit 2: Wheaton's Law, Yates."}

I think if he is scum he's making a pretty interesting play  If he's still around in a couple of days I may have to reassess... he seems like a good player and thus maybe capable of such a gambit. However, on D1 I'm not willing to lynch him against my read on the basis that he's running a gambit.<br><br>On to your question. In the game of mafia lynching serves a twofold purpose -- one is to get rid of scum, and the other is to get information for subsequent lynches. Therefore, my ideal lynch candidate is a person that both has a high probability of being scum and gives me information about who his compatriots might be. If we had absolutely confirmed scum or a candidate that is vastly superior to all others, I would vote to lynch them even if they provided zero information that would help us in subsequent days.  But we don't have that here.  I don't see anyone who I would rate as being HIGHLY probable scum, only people that I think have a pretty good chance.  And so I would support lynching one of them that would give us more information about the alignment of other players.  Yates just doesn't do that.  Despite posting a ton, he's basically been on Monkey the entire game and while he has posted regarding some other wagons, he hasn't done much and hasn't provided much real analysis.  Even if he flips scum, which I think is low possibility, his flip tells us nothing.  Was he bussing Monkey?  Who did he speak to and who did he ignore?  We might be able to puzzle some of these out from the walls that he's posted, but I would rather just lynch someone else because, as I said initially, I just don't buy him as scum.<br><br>I almost talked myself into a Monkey lynch earlier today simply because it would force Yates to shift his gaze to other targets, but that just wasn't a good enough reason for me to lynch Monkey unless we were having real trouble reaching a majority on a better lynch.<br><br>P-edit: I did read your town play in another game -L-, and you seemed much more into hunting and less into reacting to others.

Bussing is about getting credit for a Mafia flip, which you use to prove you are town, correct? <br><br>My thoughts are that if Yates and Monkey were both mafia, Yates would have realised by now he could get the credit for Monkey eventually flipping as mafia without it needing to go through as a day 1 lynch. In other words, Yates has pushed so long and so hard that if MM were to flip as scum a week from now, Yates would (legitimately) look vindicated. He could abandon the lynch in a humph, and still get the positive effect of bussing if MM flips later, all without actually having to lose a team member. <br>Instead he's pushing it to the point where he's getting some serious flak for tunnel vision.

It feels like you want to have a certain amount of suspicions on record for Monkey man but you don't want to contribute to his lynch. It feels like you have been trying to work against Monkey's wagon while at the same time having keeping your options open to vote him later?<br><br>And still to TCS, a Yates lynch wouldn't garner a lot of info either? A Slandaar lynch would be more informative than an HD lynch. Also, a Monkey lynch wouldn't be very informative. You seem to hold the potential information from flips in very high regards in deciding who to suspect. Is it more imporatant to you to vote the person you suspect the most or the person who's flip you think (for whatever reason) will provide the most info? What info would an -L-or I lynch garner? So you think an -L- lynch provides more info than a Sandaar lynch?</div></blockquote><br><br>1. Monkey hasn't been a particularly helpful poster, and while I don't really see a high likelihood of him being scum (more than null but not much more, as I indicated in post #535), I acknowledge that his lynch would be good for the town even given a smaller chance of being scum in my mind than others. It would eliminate a player who doesn't bring much to the table, who has been the center of a lot of attention today, and would free up Yates to tunnelvision someone else.<br><br>2. I don't think a Yates lynch would garner much useful info D1, as he has mostly tunneled Monkey. I also don't think he's scum.  <br><br>Think of it as a sliding scale. I would not hesitate to lynch confirmed scum even if it gave no information. I would not hesitate to lynch confirmed town if for some wild-ass reason it would provide the town with a ton of good information. Most lynches fall somewhere in between, and so my goal when determining who I want to wagon is to find a person whose behavior is scummy and whose flip would tell us the most about the rest of the game. If someone is a little scummy but there is a benefit to lynching them either way, I may support their lynch (Monkey). If someone is more scummy, but there are somewhat fewer benefits to lynching them, I still support their lynch more because we have a greater chance of catching scum (-L-). If two people seem roughly equally scummy to me, I would rather lynch the one that gives us more info (-L- as opposed to Fitz).<br><br>This is generally how I think about the game as town. Perhaps I should emphasize it less on Day 1, when we don't have that much to go on anyway, but that's roughly my thought process."}

Let's explore:<br><br>In the first case [where I used his actual join date], it was a tongue-in-cheek poke at Monkey given that the first post on the page mentioned someone else's join date.  Monkey and I have played in games together.  He knows what's up.  I wasn't discrediting him.  In fact, I was using his experience to illustrate that he should have first hand knowledge of a particular situation.  I later linked to a game that illustrated he *DID* have first hand knowledge.  In other words, his EXPERIENCE informed my read.  <br><br>In L's case, she claimed to have all sorts of experience but said pointing to Monkey's join date was \"flimsy.\"  If someone is going to make a claim like that, asking them about their experience is fair game.  Case in point: <div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4641451#p4641451\" class=\"postlink\">post 141</a>, -L- wrote:</cite>I have played mafia too long to have a meta, my dear.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br><br>Same goes for ace.  When you make an [obviously wrong] declarative statement like \"scum is always worried about coming off too hard or appearing frantic,\" experience is the sub-textual rationale, right?  If this had been You or Monkey or Slandaar making this statement, I would have simply said \"prove it\" and expected you to link to games where your statement matched your claim.  If you are accepting statements like these at face value, you are playing the game wrong.<br><br>In Toch's case [who isn't even in the game anymore], I wanted to know if he/she had ever been scum and would, thus, have already known the answer to the question they had asked.  Toch had been in 4 games and had never been scum so *I* knew it wasn't safe to assume Toch would know anything about how scum chat works.  This is actually addressed directly in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4642118#p4642118\" class=\"postlink\">post 203</a>. If anything, that's the penultimate Town play when it comes to experience.<br><br>Bottom line regarding experience, we have a lot of new faces in this game.  Mafiascum is a TEAM game.  I want my team set up for success so *I* can win.  In order to do that, I need to know what strengths and weaknesses people are bringing to the table.  If I haven't played with you and I have no meta to look at, I need to ask.

If you are going to make a nonsensical statement like the one Ace did, I'm going to discredit you or flat out prove you wrong.

Really?  I guess all I can tell you is that I have [imho] done more to set this game up for success than any other individual player.  I created a polarizing discussion.  I have provided meta for consumption.  I have set expectations on levels of play.  I literally could not have done any more to help this Town short of being a Town Day Cop with a guilty result on a person.

More often than not, the loud driver of Day 1 is investigated/target N1.  I guess I could go link some meta but I have a feeling you have been in enough games to know this is a general rule.<br><br>I will also go back to your experience question.  If our scum is comprised of entirely newer players, I feel like I can guess with a fairly high probability how nights will go.  You and Slandaar are pretty much the only people in this player list I would be concerned with making more complex gambits as scum.

You are saying you are voting me.  You are saying you are sticking with me.  You made a long post to remind us you were still in the game.  You know what you haven't done, though?

You don't have to ask questions of people to make a case on them. Your style may be to try to pick at the edges of arguments with questions.

Is your case on me a farce, even to you? <br><br>Either you have the innocent belief that I'm scum and the desire to see me lynched, in which case you should be voting me, or you are just nervous scum, in which case you are sensitive to being seen as wagon-jumping and OMGUS voting.

As with the case on L, I am responding to the points in the case rather than defending the person that is the object of the case.  These are two very different things. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4651702#p4651702\" class=\"postlink\">post 600</a>, havingfitz wrote:</cite>I do think focusing on experience levels can be scummy</div></blockquote><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">3) </span>I agree.  Focusing on experience levels *CAN* be scummy.  Would you characterize the way *I* used experience as scummy?  Let's explore:<br><br>In the first case [where I used his actual join date], it was a tongue-in-cheek poke at Monkey given that the first post on the page mentioned someone else's join date.  Monkey and I have played in games together.  He knows what's up.  I wasn't discrediting him.  In fact, I was using his experience to illustrate that he should have first hand knowledge of a particular situation.  I later linked to a game that illustrated he *DID* have first hand knowledge.  In other words, his EXPERIENCE informed my read.  <br><br>In L's case, she claimed to have all sorts of experience but said pointing to Monkey's join date was \"flimsy.\"  If someone is going to make a claim like that, asking them about their experience is fair game.  Case in point: <div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4641451#p4641451\" class=\"postlink\">post 141</a>, -L- wrote:</cite>I have played mafia too long to have a meta, my dear.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br><br>Same goes for ace.  When you make an [obviously wrong] declarative statement like \"scum is always worried about coming off too hard or appearing frantic,\" experience is the sub-textual rationale, right?  If this had been You or Monkey or Slandaar making this statement, I would have simply said \"prove it\" and expected you to link to games where your statement matched your claim.  If you are accepting statements like these at face value, you are playing the game wrong.<br><br>In Toch's case [who isn't even in the game anymore], I wanted to know if he/she had ever been scum and would, thus, have already known the answer to the question they had asked.  Toch had been in 4 games and had never been scum so *I* knew it wasn't safe to assume Toch would know anything about how scum chat works.

If anything, that's the penultimate Town play when it comes to experience.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">4) </span>Bottom line regarding experience, we have a lot of new faces in this game.  Mafiascum is a TEAM game.  I want my team set up for success so *I* can win.  In order to do that, I need to know what strengths and weaknesses people are bringing to the table.  If I haven't played with you and I have no meta to look at, I need to ask.

Really?  I guess all I can tell you is that I have [imho] done more to set this game up for success than any other individual player.  I created a polarizing discussion.  I have provided meta for consumption.  I have set expectations on levels of play.  I literally could not have done any more to help this Town short of being a Town Day Cop with a guilty result on a person.

Each person has their own methods for determining why they think a case is one or the other.<br><br>I choose not to reveal my own methods - this is just how I see you.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4655773#p4655773\" class=\"postlink\">post 688</a>, Yates wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4655217#p4655217\" class=\"postlink\">post 671</a>, Yates wrote:</cite>it's scummy to be parroted or to be the parrot?</div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br><br>When player A deconstructs player B's case on Player C, and player C begins to use the player A's words to defend himself, there are two conclusions:<br><br>1) Player A is scum defending Player C, and silently telling Player C to improve his gameplay.

That's really the basis for me seeing Yates as town here - he's painted himself into a corner with his tunneling on Monkey.

That's really the basis for me seeing Yates as town here - he's painted himself into a corner with his tunneling on Monkey.

The fact that you AREN'T a noob means you should know better and play better and you aren't.  But I guess this conversation can wait for tomorrow since I'm going to lynch your buddy today instead.<br><br>For example... accusing me of placing a \"survivalist vote\" on L?  WTF is that, Monkey?  I'm leaving a LARGER wagon to join a smaller one.  You should know, as the veteran I accuse you of being, that your accusation is fallacious.  The fact of the matter is that I now know you are both scum.  It doesn't matter to me which order you are lynched in.</div></blockquote><br><br>You know my wagon is basically dead, the size of it doesnt matter. You havent actally scumhunted on your own valid points the whole game.  You are creating a lot of noise and distracting the towns ability to win.<br><br>The fact you think I would try to pose as a noob is REALLY insulting."}

The title of the case, in fact, is \" Why Yates is not \"tunneling\" on Monkey\"<br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4648323#p4648323\" class=\"postlink\">post 484</a>, Yates wrote:</cite>What I find more fascinating about Monkey, and something I have been waiting for someone else to point out, is that he claims one of the biggest reasons he voted me had to do with my \"omgusy\" play.  The irony here is that he claims to have multiple reasons for voting me yet is unable to articulate a single alignment indicative tell - which basically translates his vote as nothing more than omgus for not letting up on him, not unvoting him, and forcing him to answer for his actions and claims.  Again, OMGUS isn't an actual scum tell.  However, if you are going to accuse someone of being scum for omgus reasons, you better not be doing it yourself.  Monkey, in my opinion, is and that is hypocritical.  Hypocrites are scummy.<br><br>Also of note is that Monkey's meager attempts at putting something together that resembled a case on me was to parrot, quote others, and in general distance himself as much as possible from the repercussions of a Yates Town flip.  <br>Take a look at these posts from Monkey's ISO: 325, 331, 342, 369, 377, 415, 438<br>Every time he calls me scummy, he hedges by either directly quoting someone else or by pointing out that other people think this way too.  By not offering his own content or case, he can divorce himself of culpability by simply pointing out that others thought the same thing so \"oops I guess we were wrong, guys\" and let's move on to the next mislynch.  That's actually a very strong scum indicator as scum typically want to be able to hold someone else accountable for a mislynch.  That's a tough trick to pull off if you are the conductor on the train.  When you are riding in the caboose [or more appropriately - coal car], like Monkey, you find yourself perfectly positioned.<br><br>Obviously, a lot of my case on Monkey has to do with confirmation bias so it would be difficult for me to convince others to join the Monkey wagon based on some of these tells.  However, I have always intended to make this post.  I just needed to give Monkey opportunity to prove me wrong because I clearly don't have a smoking gun - just MAJOR suspicion.<br><br>Suffice it to say that from my perspective my Monkey vote is clearly about MUCH more than a fake slip.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>5b - You are also pretending you didn't see my case in 764 that Monkey still hasn't responded to. <div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4659315#p4659315\" class=\"postlink\">post 764</a>, Yates wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4659270#p4659270\" class=\"postlink\">post 756</a>, theaceofspades wrote:</cite>Monkey doesn't have ANY scum posts.</div></blockquote><br>All you have to do is look at the huge volume of questions and requests that he is ignoring.

I think I've been pretty obvious about certain reads,though, if you read between the lines.  <br><br>I actually don't like to bullet list my Town reads either, as that can be a lazy tool for lazy scum to see how they are being perceived, but I can tell you that you are one of my top reads.  I find myself agreeing with you a lot and see genuine effort and logic on your part.  I am also putting Norlkaz in the \"never to be lynched\" pile.  Honestly, I would challenge a scum result on him even by an investigator at this point.  He came in to the game and immediately unvoted someone close to being lynched.  He took the time to read the game and come up with his own opinions then moved to a different read for a vote.  If he were scum, it would have been far too easy for him to say \"I'll just leave the vote wherever my predecessor was voting while figuring stuff out\" in the hopes a mislynch occurred before he \"caught up.\"  Finally there's Slandaar.  Despite my earlier comment about \"always\" finding him scummy, I think he is genuine in believing HIS version of the Monkey slip is the RIGHT version.  Barring a scum flip by Monkey, I think he could bring an informed perspective to a Town that, frankly, needs it.  So I would keep him around for a day or two to see what he brings to the table [and to see if he gets NKed].<br><br>In the case that my lynch DOES go through or that I am NKed, I would ask you to revisit my faith in Norlkaz with my alignment confirmed and consider the situation I was in at the time he unvoted."}

So I tunneled as Town twice in that game and caught two scum.  *shrug*  If you don't want to accept my \"Tochica\" defense from this game, then you have to at least acknowledge that ME tunneling is absolutely not a scum trait.  In fact, I will have to look but I'm not sure I have ever \"tunneled\" as scum.

He's basically drawing a line in the sand about his play here. That said, Yates play is either town or incredibly gutsy scum. Yates isn't making any friends not is he keeping his options open - ask yourself how a scum Yates hopes to survive a MM-town flip. That's really the basis for me seeing Yates as town here - he's painted himself into a corner with his tunneling on Monkey.

Even admitted the usual bias when it is one's self that is accused that read to me like a call to get onboard.<br>Second, being 'confused' has been a <span class=\"noboldsig\">HUGE</span> scumtell in several games I've played. Mafia want to sow confusion, they love a 'confused' town, and like to spread it. Town on the other hand don't want confusion (and on an individual level sometimes even pretend to know what's going on even when they don't).<br>Impressively Arcangel used confused and confusion in one short post. It's a bigger red flag than anything I've had about Alduskkel.</div></blockquote><br><br>You know its hilarious that sometimes people see a very small things in a larger picture and call the SCUM, How does it admitting to the fact that i am confused makes me Scum?  <br>See, the problem is that you and others have some expectations and i can understand that and also agree that i haven't been the best player of this game but i am not the scum, if you're townie, now you're helping Mafia to get me on or you may be the scum and thinking that you could this as a reason to get me lynched.<br>i don't blame you for voting but it is my responsibility to tell you that i am not the scum.   And its not like my not following whats happening around, i just didn't get chance to post much and i generally don't do the large posts.<br>its not the newbie crap or something, this is how i generally play.</div></blockquote><br><br>Thanks for the reply Arcangel. Nothing personal, if it's how you play it's how you play. I raised the objection about the 'wagon' and pointed out that confusion has been a mafia tell in games because it is my duty as a townie to mention things I notice that I believe are potential scumtells.<br>You're right its a \"small thing\", but it stood out a lot more than many of the huge posts other people are making, IMHO.</div></blockquote><br><br>Likely True, if i am scum, i wouldn't be surprised to see myself playing that card to keep low profile but again, i am not scum. and i agree that there is no better reason to convince everyone here but as a townie i will try my best on my own terms to show the town who i am, and it is also equally important for town to give benefit of doubt on few cases to see if the one is being genuine or not."}

You are insinuating that my mafia record is based on the amount of times I post in games. First...you're being an ass with that comment because we all know that we win or lose as town, and those games have no bearing on what happens in this game. I take credit for the losses whether I am a late D1 replacement who makes 10 posts and is killed N1 or if I make it to 3 person LYLO and pick wrong. And second, you're misrepresenting your ~contribution to this game and the effect it is having. No one needs to post 200+ times a day to get their opinions across. Normal players typically have to weed through a small forest for the trees that are scum...whereas thanks to you, and -L-, we've got the fcuking Amazon jungle to work with. If you consider yourself pro-town, why would you want to make it more difficult for your fellow players to look for scum? Which is what you are doing. And finding replacements (if necessary) is going to be real fun on D2 when we're up in the 50s and 60s for page counts. FFS....40 pages on D1 is ridiculous in a mini-normal (IMO of course). /rant <div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:75%\"></div> As for the current -L- wagon. Why is it still there? She has only become a serious wagon contender in the last 24 hours (can you say quicklynch?) and I find it especially amusing that both the earl;y wagon frontrunners who were at each other's throats are now on the same \"team\"...or wagon. I especially do not like Monkey's L-1 vote. Because of Matt's convincing case? WTF? Matt didn't even vote her. And his case was by no means a slam dunk. Did you expect someone with a PR to make some sort of comment early in the game that would give anyone the idea that she could be a PR? And despite saying we needed to not lynch her and that Yates was still the scummiest player, you proceed to give him crap for considering bowing down to her flailing? How is that not playing both sides of the fence?<br><br>There is no reason we should not let -L- make it to N1 at least, see if she is able to get any result, or let her draw a kill away from the rest of us. And if she makes it to D2 and her claim results don't give us a warm fuzzy...eliminate her tomorrow.<br><br>Calling BS on Monkey's recent posting wrt -L-.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Monkey</span>"}

You are insinuating that my mafia record is based on the amount of times I post in games. First...you're being an ass with that comment because we all know that we win or lose as town, and those games have no bearing on what happens in this game. I take credit for the losses whether I am a late D1 replacement who makes 10 posts and is killed N1 or if I make it to 3 person LYLO and pick wrong. And second, you're misrepresenting your ~contribution to this game and the effect it is having. No one needs to post 200+ times a day to get their opinions across. Normal players typically have to weed through a small forest for the trees that are scum...whereas thanks to you, and -L-, we've got the fcuking Amazon jungle to work with. If you consider yourself pro-town, why would you want to make it more difficult for your fellow players to look for scum? Which is what you are doing. And finding replacements (if necessary) is going to be real fun on D2 when we're up in the 50s and 60s for page counts.

I especially do not like Monkey's L-1 vote. Because of Matt's convincing case? WTF? Matt didn't even vote her. And his case was by no means a slam dunk. Did you expect someone with a PR to make some sort of comment early in the game that would give anyone the idea that she could be a PR? And despite saying we needed to not lynch her and that Yates was still the scummiest player, you proceed to give him crap for considering bowing down to her flailing? How is that not playing both sides of the fence?<br><br>There is no reason we should not let -L- make it to N1 at least, see if she is able to get any result, or let her draw a kill away from the rest of us.

Yates seems town to me, as while it's not wholly conclusive, I played a game with him where he replaced into a scum slot and spent a lot of time being super-reasonable and not inflammatory.  Which isn't to say that he is being irrational per se, but from what I've seen of his scum play, he's much more appeasing as scum.  The MonkeyMan576 case was way too protracted; it would have been a good way to get discussion going, but the way it dominated the full day phase was just inane when reading through the game after the fact.  Still, I didn't get a scum vibe from his defense.  His posts so far today don't supplement the town read very well, what with him being rather content to wagon either me or Human Destroyer, particularly the latter for weak reasons.  MonkeyMan576, aside from the NK and hoping that a scum-Human Destroyer would point to scum-Yates, what's your reasoning on Human Destroyer?<br><br>I agree with qwints about Matt-Shadowlord's posting this day phase.

And then wanting to speculate on the NK without offering up any of your own thoughts to indicate why you think it's relevant?

Yates seems town to me, as while it's not wholly conclusive, I played a game with him where he replaced into a scum slot and spent a lot of time being super-reasonable and not inflammatory.  Which isn't to say that he is being irrational per se, but from what I've seen of his scum play, he's much more appeasing as scum.  The MonkeyMan576 case was way too protracted; it would have been a good way to get discussion going, but the way it dominated the full day phase was just inane when reading through the game after the fact.  Still, I didn't get a scum vibe from his defense.  His posts so far today don't supplement the town read very well, what with him being rather content to wagon either me or Human Destroyer, particularly the latter for weak reasons.

And then wanting to speculate on the NK without offering up any of your own thoughts to indicate why you think it's relevant?

I play poker and when you play poker one thing you try to do when assessing a \"bluff\" is to determine if someones \"story makes sense.\"  I try to use that kind of analysis when playing Mafia, and to me everything going on with HD points to him being scummy.  Plus killing him would give us lots of info on other players, and the mafia's nk reasoning."}

How to get a townie lynched 101, by Norlkaz.</div></blockquote><br>Fine, I'll go one more round.<br>0. The Slandaar kill makes you more likely to be scum because a team with you on it is more likely to kill Slandaar than a team without you on it.<br><br>Were Slandaar left alive, he would probably have continued attacking you.<br>If you're town, this would benefit scum, so he'd have been more likely left alive and Qwints or I killed instead.<br>Neither Qwints nor I are particularly easy to predict the behavior of based on our play yesterday, both of us are good players, and both of us are highly unlikely to get lynched. <br>Slandaar, on the other hand, was even on some suspect lists. <br>If you're scum, Slandaar is a much higher priority target because he directly threatens you.<br><br>Is it possible that scum killed Slandaar thinking he was a PR?<br>Yes. This option neither favors nor hurts your scum-likelihood.<br><br>Is it possible that scum killed Slandaar seeking to implicate you?<br>That is less likely, because it's hard to predict how town's reads will be affected by nightkilling a particular player.<br>This is the case you are referring to when you say \"WIFOM.\"<br>Going one level deeper, it is actually reasonably likely that you believed town would overvalue this possibility and let you get away with saying \"WIFOMWIFOMWIFOM\" when you killed Slandaar.<br><br>In the end, while it is fully possible a team without you on it killed Slandaar, his death makes it more likely that you are scum.<br><br>\"WIFOM\" is not a 'valid point in response' (to use your term) to the above line of reasoning. You are simply mentioning a particular, somewhat unlikely explanation of what happened which I already took into account before making the statement \"The Slandaar kill makes you more likely to be scum.\"<br><br>2 &amp; 4. 100% town wagons are intrinsically more likely to occur on scum than town (relative to random) for several reasons.<br>First and simplest, a scum isn't going to be on his or her own wagon. This means the pool of townies available for wagon participation is larger relative to the pool of scum than normal, increasing the probability of a 100% town wagon.<br><br>Next, town are in general better than random at voting for scum. Were they not, scum would have dominant win percentages (most setups require town to lynch better than random to win, and the scum voting block / elimination of accurate players stack the deck further). Thus a player several townies want lynched is a good person to lynch. Especially when there is no evidence that scum also desire the lynch (100% town wagon).<br><br>Additionally, scum want to help townies be wrong. They tend to support wagons on town by town by joining them rather than doing their own thing.<br>(This is separately a reason HD's sheeping of wagons on people who have flipped town D1 is scummy)<br>Thus the absence of scum from a wagon is an indicator that it may be on scum.<br><br>\"Townies can be wrong\" is not a 'valid point in response' to the above line of reasoning. You are simply mentioning another explanation of what happened which I already took into account before making the statement \"Your 100% town wagon yesterday and Qwints' vote make you more likely to be scum.\"<br><br>3. Most of your responses to Slandaar's points are similar to your responses to the above - you can come up with a reason town did practically anything, but that doesn't mean the action pointed out does not increase the odds you're scum.<br><br>Happy?"}

Two mafia team mates are the least likely to actually be offended in harsh exchanges since 1)they know they're allied; and 2) those exchanges are often faked.

I've actually caught myself doing the same thing a couple times as scum (noticing yourself doing strange things as scum is a lot of how you find scumtells in the first place).

How to get a townie lynched 101, by Norlkaz.</div></blockquote><br>Fine, I'll go one more round.<br>0. The Slandaar kill makes you more likely to be scum because a team with you on it is more likely to kill Slandaar than a team without you on it.<br><br>Were Slandaar left alive, he would probably have continued attacking you.<br>If you're town, this would benefit scum, so he'd have been more likely left alive and Qwints or I killed instead.<br>Neither Qwints nor I are particularly easy to predict the behavior of based on our play yesterday, both of us are good players, and both of us are highly unlikely to get lynched. <br>Slandaar, on the other hand, was even on some suspect lists. <br>If you're scum, Slandaar is a much higher priority target because he directly threatens you.<br><br>Is it possible that scum killed Slandaar thinking he was a PR?<br>Yes. This option neither favors nor hurts your scum-likelihood.<br><br>Is it possible that scum killed Slandaar seeking to implicate you?<br>That is less likely, because it's hard to predict how town's reads will be affected by nightkilling a particular player.<br>This is the case you are referring to when you say \"WIFOM.\"<br>Going one level deeper, it is actually reasonably likely that you believed town would overvalue this possibility and let you get away with saying \"WIFOMWIFOMWIFOM\" when you killed Slandaar.<br><br>In the end, while it is fully possible a team without you on it killed Slandaar, his death makes it more likely that you are scum.<br><br>\"WIFOM\" is not a 'valid point in response' (to use your term) to the above line of reasoning. You are simply mentioning a particular, somewhat unlikely explanation of what happened which I already took into account before making the statement \"The Slandaar kill makes you more likely to be scum.\"<br><br>2 &amp; 4. 100% town wagons are intrinsically more likely to occur on scum than town (relative to random) for several reasons.<br>First and simplest, a scum isn't going to be on his or her own wagon. This means the pool of townies available for wagon participation is larger relative to the pool of scum than normal, increasing the probability of a 100% town wagon.<br><br>Next, town are in general better than random at voting for scum. Were they not, scum would have dominant win percentages (most setups require town to lynch better than random to win, and the scum voting block / elimination of accurate players stack the deck further). Thus a player several townies want lynched is a good person to lynch. Especially when there is no evidence that scum also desire the lynch (100% town wagon).<br><br>Additionally, scum want to help townies be wrong. They tend to support wagons on town by town by joining them rather than doing their own thing.<br>(This is separately a reason HD's sheeping of wagons on people who have flipped town D1 is scummy)<br>Thus the absence of scum from a wagon is an indicator that it may be on scum.<br><br>\"Townies can be wrong\" is not a 'valid point in response' to the above line of reasoning. You are simply mentioning another explanation of what happened which I already took into account before making the statement \"Your 100% town wagon yesterday and Qwints' vote make you more likely to be scum.\"<br><br>3. Most of your responses to Slandaar's points are similar to your responses to the above - you can come up with a reason town did practically anything, but that doesn't mean the action pointed out does not increase the odds you're scum.<br><br>Happy?</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4678780#p4678780\" class=\"postlink\">post 1114</a>, Norlkaz wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4678497#p4678497\" class=\"postlink\">post 1100</a>, penguin_alien wrote:</cite>The backtracking thing as far as I can tell was someone admitting he was wrong in an assumption about another player's experience; not exactly damning.

Also, he never told us Acosmist's \"scum slip\" and the fake dayvig thing was terrible.<br>- BK - why did you run this up to 5 so fast? This looks like more of a legit pressure vote [based on later posts] but what did you hope to get out of this play?<br>- MattP/mcqueen - Seriously? You put him at L-1 just like that?? I haven't even had time to erect my morning hard on and you already put a player at L-1??<br><br>This gave me the idea to look at the rest of the Day's major wagons.<br><br>Here's the Slandaar wagon as of 527:<br>- Me<br>- *Benmage<br>- *dicknose/MoI<br>- *Psyche/sniffit<br>- *Thor<br><br>Here's the Acosmist wagon version 2 as of 677:<br>- *Me<br>- **Thor<br>- *mcqueen/MattP<br>- **sniffit/Psyche<br>- JohnnyFarrar<br><br>Now I look at my wagon as of post 952:<br>- Slandaar - <br>- Acosmist - <br>- **Benmage - <br>- **dicknose/MoI - <br>- Agent_Ireland - <br><br>I will admit that it isn't a *perfect* system.

I have Thor as obvTown so I'm not sure how to reconcile that other than to consider it an outlier. I also have sniffit as a strong Town read that turned the Psyche slot around so I'll chalk that up to poor play by Psyche?<br><br>Acosmist is obvTown at this point.<br><br>I will begrudgingly admit that there is a good chance Slandaar is Town BUT I'm not ruling out the fakeclaim and I would want to see some flavor flips.

When he posts content I agree [especially 561 and 677!] with just about everything he says and understand his logic. This is why I don't understand the people willing to vote JF.

The attempts at humor feel fabricated, though, and weaken his position. Then 926 comes back with a strong post. Then his next posts are super weak.

I suppose it could be a gambit, where Yates hopes to be conf-town with a Monkey-scum flip, but that's a very risky move D1 since Yates then has to explain a conf-town not getting nk'd. <br><br>Monkey's play looks to me like his freaked-out town play I've seen him mislynched for before. I'm really worried that we've got a town-town fight between Yates and MM that would be all too easy for scum into turn into two quick mislynches. I'm willing to bet more than one scum is egging this along.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4659774#p4659774\" class=\"postlink\">post 813</a>, qwints wrote:</cite>[Ongoing]<br><br>The read is based on the fact that Monkey's spending his time ridiculing the wagon on him and attacking his attackers rather than looking elsewhere.

I don't believe there are any rules against speculating on why someone replaced out. I do believe that replacements are a null tell because non-alignment related reasons tend to dominate there.<br><br>I am confused by the fact that you're pushing this case because it has a lot of nonsensical conjecture - distancing/bussing is a universal strategy mafia/werewolf, and I know you're familiar with it because of post <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4650720#p4650720\" class=\"postlink\">570</a>. Two mafia team mates are the least likely to actually be offended in harsh exchanges since 1)they know they're allied; and 2) those exchanges are often faked. In fact, seeing two players who are genuinely annoyed at each other is one of the best tells that they're not on the same team since it's hard to fake. <br><br>On top of that, you think the mod decided to intervene in a alignment-specific way. I can't imagine any decent mod saying \"I don't think scum team is doing a good job playing together, so I better replace one.\" And I don't really think you could actually believe that.<br><br>So why are you pushing this far-fetched case? I think it's because you want to make a novel case against a player who looks pretty scummy and has a fair amount of suspicion against him. If it wasn't for the way you attacked him today, my vote would still be on HD. Here's how I see your style: make cases on people who have some suspicion on them then cheer the wagon while trying to be one of the least responsible ones for the wagon. It worked for -L- and you thought it would work for HD, but you were too obvious.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4679448#p4679448\" class=\"postlink\">post 1130</a>, qwints wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4678479#p4678479\" class=\"postlink\">post 1099</a>, The Central Scrutinizer wrote:</cite>The Matt_Shadowlord case looks good to me but I'm wary of a wagon so far populated only by people that lynched a townie yesterday, and for much similar reasons.

The fact that a scummy Matt is pushing the HD lynch in a very similar way to how he pushed the -L- lynch makes me keep my vote on Matt rather than HD.
