Specific ones to mention are play to your win condition, no complex codes, and do not heavily insult another person in this game (insulting a play style is one thing, but being very harsh to a person isn&#8217;t allowed).<br>\n</li><li>Do not quote your role pm. Paraphrasing is fine.<br>\n</li><li>Do not quote any other mod communications. Paraphrasing is again fine. If you have a qt then while you still can&#8217;t quote anything I say in it, any of your comments are allowed to be quoted.<br>\n</li><li>Day 1 lasts a maximum two weeks. All days after that last a maximum of 10 days.<br>\n</li><li>Night phases last 48 hours.<br>\n</li><li>You will be prodded after 48 hours of inactivity and replaced after an additional 24 hours of not replying to a prod. You will be immediately replaced if you get three prods. You may ask me to prod a player if they&#8217;ve already gone 36 hours without posting and I haven&#8217;t done it yet.<br>\n</li><li>If you go on V/LA pm me or announce it in thread. I&#8217;ll count it anyway if you just put the V/LA banner on, but it&#8217;s preferable to mention it to me. <br>\n</li><li>Put votes in bold or use vote tags with the format vote: user (or no lynch if desired). If it looks like a vote, but the format is off then I&#8217;ll still count it.<br>\n</li><li>A player will be lynched at majority. A no lynch requires half of the people alive to vote no lynch.. Everyone that is alive (including the lynchee if a lynch occurs) is allowed to keep on talking during twilight.<br>\n</li><li>A no lynch will occur at deadline if there is no majority by then.<br>\n</li><li>Blue is my color. Do not use it. Any other color is allowed to use if desired. Do not impersonate the mod in any way. The only person besides me who can mod this game is my back up mod, RichardGHP.<br>\n</li><li>I have permission to edit these rules or add anything else that I deem to be missing. Use common sense when playing and ask me if what you&#8217;re going to do feels a bit against the rules.<br>\n</li><li>Rules are fairly short and concise, but finally do remember to enjoy the game as well.</li></ol><br>\n<br>\nLastly this is what the town vanilla role pm looks like:</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase;margin:0 0.6em;padding:0em 0.33em\">Town - Vanilla</legend>Active Powers<ul><li>None</li></ul><br>\nPassive Powers<ul><li>None</li></ul><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Win Condition: You win when all players who have a win condition that interferes with your own are dead.</div></fieldset><br>\n<br>\nConfirm in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=25071&amp;p=4634745#p4634745\" class=\"postlink\">thread</a>.

{"number": 172, "id": "4641672", "user": "The Central Scrutinizer", "user_id": "3672", "content": "I think that Yates's accusation of Monkeyman in post #59 is nonsense.  Monkeyman never made a single positive claim about whether scum can talk during QT, daytalk, night, whatever.  He made no positive statement at all, but asked a question.  He thought that day had started because there were posts with content, in which context havingfitz's comment about extending scum private chat time would have made no sense.  So Yates's accusation was based on either a misread or malice.  <br>\n<br>\nIn my limited experience scum is more likely to jump on wagons than to start them, so my question is, who jumped on this CLEARLY erroneous bandwagon?  How did people react?<br>\n<br>\nIn post #65, -L- was skeptical.<br>\nIn post #67 Matt-Shadowlord seemed confused but thought it might be a plausible line of inquiry.<br>\nIn post #68, havingfitz voted for Monkeyman, claiming that Yates \"beat him to it\"<br>\nIn post #71 Alduskkel voted for Monkeyman with no explanation<br>\nIn post #74 Yates posts \"evidence\" that shows that Monkeyman definitely knows that scum can talk N0.  But the fact remains that Monkeyman never claimed that such a thing was impossible.<br>\nIn post #75 Matt-Shadowlord buys it and votes Monkeyman<br>\nIn post #80, Human Destroyer jumps on the wagon with the comment \"this is a good wagon\"<br>\n<br>\nOn the next page, Yates seems to be suffering from extreme tunnelvision.  I agree with -L-'s comment in #135 and its implication that this is more likely to be a townie trait than a scum trait.<br>\n<br>\nIn post #132, havingfitz unvotes Monkeyman without reason given.<br>\nIn #140 TheActingMethod \"doesn't get\" the bandwagon<br>\n<br>\n----<br>\n<br>\nThe one thing I'm really uncomfortable with here is that my number one suspect after first re-read was havingfitz, and I don't think scum would jump off the wagon at that point (unless Monkeyman were actually scum).<br>\n<br>\nSo I have two options: Monkey/Fitz scumteam, or Option 2.  Option 2 is that Monkey is town and  Alduskkel, Matt, or HD (but not all) are scum opportunistically hopping on wagons. <br>\n<br>\nMonkey just doesn't read scum to me, especially after reading him in isolation in the game Yates posted.  So I'm going to go with option 2.

Anyone that has been on this site for a while and that has been given a scum role would know how scum QT's work.  Monkey is a site veteran and, as he has admitted, would absolutely know this.  So, I am presented with a scenario in which a site veteran makes a post where he questions how QT's work and how not starting the day [by not confirming roles] helps to extend the scum QT.  For someone like Monkey?  This comes off as disingenuous.  You can choose to believe that he was simply \"confused\" as to whether or not the day had started, as he alleges, or you can believe as I do that this is his way of back tracking on a gambit that blew up in his face.<br>\n<br>\nI am just now realizing how few experienced players there are on this player list.

I think faking is very easy as long as you don't really facing the person, and in a game like this.

Further, I would posit that if he flips scum, there is a high probability that he has been locked onto a scumpartner all along in order to play the long game.  <br>\n<br>\nTherefore, I will go with what I see as the superior information play.  <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Human Destroyer</span> <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Slandaar</span></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis is good stuff.

MM basically puts in no effort to push Yates-scum; he doesn't construct a case, just realizes on a sentence or two and, more importantly, crediting others and their cases. Convenient for not taking the blame if/when Yates flips town. Additionally, posts such as 325 and 415 to me read that MM doesn't actually care too much if Yates is town or scum, just that Yates \"won't listen to reason\" and so he should be lynched on those grounds -- which is the kind of approach to a lynch that scum would have.

I thought [and continue to think] it was a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">fake</div> slip/gambit.  However, while that is what turned me on to Monkey in the first place, that is only part of the reason I'm maintaining my vote on Monkey.  The fact of the matter is that he has not satisfactorily addressed my concern that *I* believe he intended for that to be a fake Town slip, got caught, then weakly tried to defend it by pretending he didn't know day had started.  I will admit that at this point that would be a lot to ask of him.  Call it a \"tunnel\" if you want but I find it hugely suspicious that it took him TWELVE posts to come up with the \"Okay, I see the confusion\" post.  Not enough to make him scum on it's own, granted, but a major indicator - much like a slow claim or botched claim.<br>\n<br>\nWhat I find more fascinating about Monkey, and something I have been waiting for someone else to point out, is that he claims one of the biggest reasons he voted me had to do with my \"omgusy\" play.  The irony here is that he claims to have multiple reasons for voting me yet is unable to articulate a single alignment indicative tell - which basically translates his vote as nothing more than omgus for not letting up on him, not unvoting him, and forcing him to answer for his actions and claims.  Again, OMGUS isn't an actual scum tell.  However, if you are going to accuse someone of being scum for omgus reasons, you better not be doing it yourself.  Monkey, in my opinion, is and that is hypocritical.  Hypocrites are scummy.<br>\n<br>\nAlso of note is that Monkey's meager attempts at putting something together that resembled a case on me was to parrot, quote others, and in general distance himself as much as possible from the repercussions of a Yates Town flip.  <br>\nTake a look at these posts from Monkey's ISO: 325, 331, 342, 369, 377, 415, 438<br>\nEvery time he calls me scummy, he hedges by either directly quoting someone else or by pointing out that other people think this way too.  By not offering his own content or case, he can divorce himself of culpability by simply pointing out that others thought the same thing so \"oops I guess we were wrong, guys\" and let's move on to the next mislynch.  That's actually a very strong scum indicator as scum <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">typically</div> want to be able to hold someone <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">else</div> accountable for a mislynch.  That's a tough trick to pull off if you are the conductor on the train.  When you are riding in the caboose [or more appropriately - coal car], like Monkey, you find yourself perfectly positioned.<br>\n<br>\nObviously, a lot of my case on Monkey has to do with confirmation bias so it would be difficult for me to convince others to join the Monkey wagon based on some of these tells.  However, I have always intended to make this post.  I just needed to give Monkey opportunity to prove me wrong because I clearly don't have a smoking gun - just MAJOR suspicion.<br>\n<br>\nSuffice it to say that from my perspective my Monkey vote is clearly about MUCH more than a fake slip.", "time": "Wed Jan 16, 2013 4:09 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=25071&start=475", "forum": "53", "thread": "25071"}

There would be no reason for him to assume Fitz was referring to day chat.

Yates is very probably town, so we should not lynch him.  Further, lynching him gives us no information on anything.  If he's scum, his death is good but it tells us little.  If he's town, we lose a person who generates a lot of action.  If we mislynch a couple of times and he's still around, we should look to Yates, but not yet.  Monkey reads to me as possible scum, and I would lynch him on deadline.  But I think he's a low information lynch.  <br>\n<br>\nWe need a plausible third option that people can get behind, an option that gives us more information.  That person will likely be someone who has contributed very little to scumhunting and seems content to allow us to lynch Monkey or Yates without either contributing to it, looking into other options, or seriously evaluating the posts of any others.<br>\n<br>\nISO re-read summaries:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">-L-</div>: A little fluffy.

I tried in earnest to get him to post anything in a pro Town manner.  He refused to do any of it - just like Monkey - he ended up being Town but his anti Town antics cost us the game.  There was, in fact, discussion about blacklisting him in the dead QT but that's a different topic.  So it would be fair to state that I can not differentiate between anti-Town Town behavior and anti-Town scum behavior.  Monkey falls into one of these two categories and is - in fact - an anti Town entity and liability no mater how you shake it out.<br>\n<br>\nAll you have to do is look at Monkey's current vote to see that this is an accurate characterization of his play.  He is voting -L- based on TCS's plan that is based on meta.  I don't know if Monkey is even aware that the meta TCS is referring to was introduced by me.

Please respond to my above question.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nInitially, I don't think that Yates is scum. I think if he is scum he's making a pretty interesting play  If he's still around in a couple of days I may have to reassess... he seems like a good player and thus maybe capable of such a gambit. However, on D1 I'm not willing to lynch him against my read on the basis that he's running a gambit.<br>\n<br>\nOn to your question. In the game of mafia lynching serves a twofold purpose -- one is to get rid of scum, and the other is to get information for subsequent lynches. Therefore, my ideal lynch candidate is a person that both has a high probability of being scum and gives me information about who his compatriots might be. If we had absolutely confirmed scum or a candidate that is vastly superior to all others, I would vote to lynch them even if they provided zero information that would help us in subsequent days.  But we don't have that here.  I don't see anyone who I would rate as being HIGHLY probable scum, only people that I think have a pretty good chance.  And so I would support lynching one of them that would give us more information about the alignment of other players.  Yates just doesn't do that.  Despite posting a ton, he's basically been on Monkey the entire game and while he has posted regarding some other wagons, he hasn't done much and hasn't provided much real analysis.  Even if he flips scum, which I think is low possibility, his flip tells us nothing.  Was he bussing Monkey?  Who did he speak to and who did he ignore?  We might be able to puzzle some of these out from the walls that he's posted, but I would rather just lynch someone else because, as I said initially, I just don't buy him as scum.<br>\n<br>\nI almost talked myself into a Monkey lynch earlier today simply because it would force Yates to shift his gaze to other targets, but that just wasn't a good enough reason for me to lynch Monkey unless we were having real trouble reaching a majority on a better lynch.<br>\n<br>\nP-edit: I did read your town play in another game -L-, and you seemed much more into hunting and less into reacting to others.

Please respond to my above question.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nInitially, I don't think that Yates is scum. I think if he is scum he's making a pretty interesting play  If he's still around in a couple of days I may have to reassess... he seems like a good player and thus maybe capable of such a gambit. However, on D1 I'm not willing to lynch him against my read on the basis that he's running a gambit.<br>\n<br>\nOn to your question. In the game of mafia lynching serves a twofold purpose -- one is to get rid of scum, and the other is to get information for subsequent lynches. Therefore, my ideal lynch candidate is a person that both has a high probability of being scum and gives me information about who his compatriots might be. If we had absolutely confirmed scum or a candidate that is vastly superior to all others, I would vote to lynch them even if they provided zero information that would help us in subsequent days.  But we don't have that here.  I don't see anyone who I would rate as being HIGHLY probable scum, only people that I think have a pretty good chance.  And so I would support lynching one of them that would give us more information about the alignment of other players.  Yates just doesn't do that.  Despite posting a ton, he's basically been on Monkey the entire game and while he has posted regarding some other wagons, he hasn't done much and hasn't provided much real analysis.  Even if he flips scum, which I think is low possibility, his flip tells us nothing.  Was he bussing Monkey?  Who did he speak to and who did he ignore?  We might be able to puzzle some of these out from the walls that he's posted, but I would rather just lynch someone else because, as I said initially, I just don't buy him as scum.<br>\n<br>\nI almost talked myself into a Monkey lynch earlier today simply because it would force Yates to shift his gaze to other targets, but that just wasn't a good enough reason for me to lynch Monkey unless we were having real trouble reaching a majority on a better lynch.<br>\n<br>\nP-edit: I did read your town play in another game -L-, and you seemed much more into hunting and less into reacting to others.  That was my impression.<br>\n<br>\nP-edit 2: Wheaton's Law, Yates.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nTo add in a most recent post - <br>\n<br>\nI see this as a definitive attempt to buddy yates.<br>\n<br>\nI also see yates as solidly town because of the nuance about reading metas he caught on to - which I did as well.

In other words, Yates has pushed so long and so hard that if MM were to flip as scum a week from now, Yates would (legitimately) look vindicated. He could abandon the lynch in a humph, and still get the positive effect of bussing if MM flips later, all without actually having to lose a team member. <br>\nInstead he's pushing it to the point where he's getting some serious flak for tunnel vision.

I do think focusing on experience levels can be scummy. I took your questions as a way of basically discrediting other players opinions.

And holding someone more experienced to a higher standard is more acceptable IMO than what I see as discrediting someone who has a more recent join date or fewer posts. And when I say you haven't been productive...it's because I see you posting massive amounts of content but I do not recall any benefit coming from them.

Monkey hasn't been a particularly helpful poster, and while I don't really see a high likelihood of him being scum (more than null but not much more, as I indicated in post #535), I acknowledge that his lynch would be good for the town even given a smaller chance of being scum in my mind than others. It would eliminate a player who doesn't bring much to the table, who has been the center of a lot of attention today, and would free up Yates to tunnelvision someone else.<br>\n<br>\n2. I don't think a Yates lynch would garner much useful info D1, as he has mostly tunneled Monkey. I also don't think he's scum.  <br>\n<br>\nThink of it as a sliding scale. I would not hesitate to lynch confirmed scum even if it gave no information. I would not hesitate to lynch confirmed town if for some wild-ass reason it would provide the town with a ton of good information. Most lynches fall somewhere in between, and so my goal when determining who I want to wagon is to find a person whose behavior is scummy and whose flip would tell us the most about the rest of the game. If someone is a little scummy but there is a benefit to lynching them either way, I may support their lynch (Monkey). If someone is more scummy, but there are somewhat fewer benefits to lynching them, I still support their lynch more because we have a greater chance of catching scum (-L-). If two people seem roughly equally scummy to me, I would rather lynch the one that gives us more info (-L- as opposed to Fitz).<br>\n<br>\nThis is generally how I think about the game as town. Perhaps I should emphasize it less on Day 1, when we don't have that much to go on anyway, but that's roughly my thought process.", "time": "Fri Jan 18, 2013 6:42 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=25071&start=600", "forum": "53", "thread": "25071"}

I'm not fond of buddying and try not responding to it - which is probably why I'm being accused of \"ignoring\" HD.  He hasn't done or said anything outright scummy, though.  He also hasn't said or done anything rah rah pro Town either or dazzled me with a case yet.  I am firmly null on him.<br>\n<br>\nAs far as the case goes, that was less about HD the player and more about Slandaar's case.  As with the case on L, I am responding to the points in the case rather than defending the person that is the object of the case.  These are two very different things.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4651702#p4651702\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4651702#p4651702\" data-post-id=\"4651702\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 600</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11821\">havingfitz</a> wrote:</cite>I do think focusing on experience levels can be scummy</div></blockquote><br>\nI agree.  Focusing on experience levels *CAN* be scummy.  Would you characterize the way *I* used experience as scummy?  Let's explore:<br>\n<br>\nIn the first case [where I used his actual join date], it was a tongue-in-cheek poke at Monkey given that the first post on the page mentioned someone else's join date.  Monkey and I have played in games together.  He knows what's up.  I wasn't discrediting him.  In fact, I was using his experience to illustrate that he should have first hand knowledge of a particular situation.  I later linked to a game that illustrated he *DID* have first hand knowledge.  In other words, his EXPERIENCE informed my read.  <br>\n<br>\nIn L's case, she claimed to have all sorts of experience but said pointing to Monkey's join date was \"flimsy.\"  If someone is going to make a claim like that, asking them about their experience is fair game.  Case in point: <div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4641451#p4641451\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4641451#p4641451\" data-post-id=\"4641451\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 141</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12390\">-L-</a> wrote:</cite>I have played mafia too long to have a meta, my dear.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nSame goes for ace.  When you make an [obviously wrong] declarative statement like \"scum is always worried about coming off too hard or appearing frantic,\" experience is the sub-textual rationale, right?  If this had been You or Monkey or Slandaar making this statement, I would have simply said \"prove it\" and expected you to link to games where your statement matched your claim.  If you are accepting statements like these at face value, you are playing the game wrong.<br>\n<br>\nIn Toch's case [who isn't even in the game anymore], I wanted to know if he/she had ever been scum and would, thus, have already known the answer to the question they had asked.  Toch had been in 4 games and had never been scum so *I* knew it wasn't safe to assume Toch would know anything about how scum chat works.

If anything, that's the penultimate Town play when it comes to experience.<br>\n<br>\nBottom line regarding experience, we have a lot of new faces in this game.  Mafiascum is a TEAM game.  I want my team set up for success so *I* can win.  In order to do that, I need to know what strengths and weaknesses people are bringing to the table.

You don't have to ask questions of people to make a case on them. Your style may be to try to pick at the edges of arguments with questions.

When people make cases and do not ask questions, it is a policy of mine to find out why.<br>\n<br>\nRegarding making a long post on someone - no - they are not always cases. Mine is a post analysis.

Focusing on experience levels *CAN* be scummy.  Would you characterize the way *I* used experience as scummy?  Let's explore:<br>\n<br>\nIn the first case [where I used his actual join date], it was a tongue-in-cheek poke at Monkey given that the first post on the page mentioned someone else's join date.  Monkey and I have played in games together.  He knows what's up.  I wasn't discrediting him.  In fact, I was using his experience to illustrate that he should have first hand knowledge of a particular situation.  I later linked to a game that illustrated he *DID* have first hand knowledge.  In other words, his EXPERIENCE informed my read.  <br>\n<br>\nIn L's case, she claimed to have all sorts of experience but said pointing to Monkey's join date was \"flimsy.\"  If someone is going to make a claim like that, asking them about their experience is fair game.  Case in point: <div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4641451#p4641451\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4641451#p4641451\" data-post-id=\"4641451\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 141</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12390\">-L-</a> wrote:</cite>I have played mafia too long to have a meta, my dear.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nSame goes for ace.  When you make an [obviously wrong] declarative statement like \"scum is always worried about coming off too hard or appearing frantic,\" experience is the sub-textual rationale, right?  If this had been You or Monkey or Slandaar making this statement, I would have simply said \"prove it\" and expected you to link to games where your statement matched your claim.  If you are accepting statements like these at face value, you are playing the game wrong.<br>\n<br>\nIn Toch's case [who isn't even in the game anymore], I wanted to know if he/she had ever been scum and would, thus, have already known the answer to the question they had asked.  Toch had been in 4 games and had never been scum so *I* knew it wasn't safe to assume Toch would know anything about how scum chat works.  This is actually addressed directly in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4642118#p4642118\" class=\"postlink\">post 203</a>. If anything, that's the penultimate Town play when it comes to experience.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">4) </div>Bottom line regarding experience, we have a lot of new faces in this game.  Mafiascum is a TEAM game.  I want my team set up for success so *I* can win.  In order to do that, I need to know what strengths and weaknesses people are bringing to the table.  If I haven't played with you and I have no meta to look at, I need to ask.

The irony here is that he claims to have multiple reasons for voting me yet is unable to articulate a single alignment indicative tell - which basically translates his vote as nothing more than omgus for not letting up on him, not unvoting him, and forcing him to answer for his actions and claims.  Again, OMGUS isn't an actual scum tell.  However, if you are going to accuse someone of being scum for omgus reasons, you better not be doing it yourself.  Monkey, in my opinion, is and that is hypocritical.  Hypocrites are scummy.<br>\n<br>\nAlso of note is that Monkey's meager attempts at putting something together that resembled a case on me was to parrot, quote others, and in general distance himself as much as possible from the repercussions of a Yates Town flip.  <br>\nTake a look at these posts from Monkey's ISO: 325, 331, 342, 369, 377, 415, 438<br>\nEvery time he calls me scummy, he hedges by either directly quoting someone else or by pointing out that other people think this way too.  By not offering his own content or case, he can divorce himself of culpability by simply pointing out that others thought the same thing so \"oops I guess we were wrong, guys\" and let's move on to the next mislynch.  That's actually a very strong scum indicator as scum typically want to be able to hold someone else accountable for a mislynch.  That's a tough trick to pull off if you are the conductor on the train.  When you are riding in the caboose [or more appropriately - coal car], like Monkey, you find yourself perfectly positioned.<br>\n<br>\nObviously, a lot of my case on Monkey has to do with confirmation bias so it would be difficult for me to convince others to join the Monkey wagon based on some of these tells.

I find myself agreeing with you a lot and see genuine effort and logic on your part.  I am also putting Norlkaz in the \"never to be lynched\" pile.  Honestly, I would challenge a scum result on him even by an investigator at this point.  He came in to the game and immediately unvoted someone close to being lynched.  He took the time to read the game and come up with his own opinions then moved to a different read for a vote.  If he were scum, it would have been far too easy for him to say \"I'll just leave the vote wherever my predecessor was voting while figuring stuff out\" in the hopes a mislynch occurred before he \"caught up.\"  Finally there's Slandaar.  Despite my earlier comment about \"always\" finding him scummy, I think he is genuine in believing HIS version of the Monkey slip is the RIGHT version.  Barring a scum flip by Monkey, I think he could bring an informed perspective to a Town that, frankly, needs it.  So I would keep him around for a day or two to see what he brings to the table [and to see if he gets NKed].<br>\n<br>\nIn the case that my lynch DOES go through or that I am NKed, I would ask you to revisit my faith in Norlkaz with my alignment confirmed and consider the situation I was in at the time he unvoted.", "time": "Tue Jan 22, 2013 1:49 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=25071&start=925", "forum": "53", "thread": "25071"}

Nothing personal, if it's how you play it's how you play.

BUT - you stated you were convinced all three of us were scum.  And, as you just pointed out, you had me pegged as scum and threatened to vote me more than once.

You are insinuating that my mafia record is based on the amount of times I post in games. First...you're being an ass with that comment because we all know that we win or lose as town, and those games have no bearing on what happens in this game. I take credit for the losses whether I am a late D1 replacement who makes 10 posts and is killed N1 or if I make it to 3 person LYLO and pick wrong. And second, you're misrepresenting your ~contribution to this game and the effect it is having. No one needs to post 200+ times a day to get their opinions across. Normal players typically have to weed through a small forest for the trees that are scum...whereas thanks to you, and -L-, we've got the fcuking Amazon jungle to work with. If you consider yourself pro-town, why would you want to make it more difficult for your fellow players to look for scum? Which is what you are doing. And finding replacements (if necessary) is going to be real fun on D2 when we're up in the 50s and 60s for page counts. FFS....40 pages on D1 is ridiculous in a mini-normal (IMO of course). /rant <div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:75%\"></div> As for the current -L- wagon. Why is it still there? She has only become a serious wagon contender in the last 24 hours (can you say quicklynch?) and I find it especially amusing that both the earl;y wagon frontrunners who were at each other's throats are now on the same \"team\"...or wagon. I especially do not like Monkey's L-1 vote. Because of Matt's convincing case? WTF? Matt didn't even vote her. And his case was by no means a slam dunk. Did you expect someone with a PR to make some sort of comment early in the game that would give anyone the idea that she could be a PR? And despite saying we needed to not lynch her and that Yates was still the scummiest player, you proceed to give him crap for considering bowing down to her flailing? How is that not playing both sides of the fence?<br>\n<br>\nThere is no reason we should not let -L- make it to N1 at least, see if she is able to get any result, or let her draw a kill away from the rest of us. And if she makes it to D2 and her claim results don't give us a warm fuzzy...eliminate her tomorrow.<br>\n<br>\nCalling BS on Monkey's recent posting wrt -L-.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Monkey</span>", "time": "Wed Jan 23, 2013 5:34 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=25071&start=1000", "forum": "53", "thread": "25071"}

You are insinuating that my mafia record is based on the amount of times I post in games. First...you're being an ass with that comment because we all know that we win or lose as town, and those games have no bearing on what happens in this game. I take credit for the losses whether I am a late D1 replacement who makes 10 posts and is killed N1 or if I make it to 3 person LYLO and pick wrong. And second, you're misrepresenting your ~contribution to this game and the effect it is having. No one needs to post 200+ times a day to get their opinions across. Normal players typically have to weed through a small forest for the trees that are scum...whereas thanks to you, and -L-, we've got the fcuking Amazon jungle to work with. If you consider yourself pro-town, why would you want to make it more difficult for your fellow players to look for scum? Which is what you are doing. And finding replacements (if necessary) is going to be real fun on D2 when we're up in the 50s and 60s for page counts. FFS....40 pages on D1 is ridiculous in a mini-normal (IMO of course). /rant <div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:75%\"></div> As for the current -L- wagon. Why is it still there? She has only become a serious wagon contender in the last 24 hours (can you say quicklynch?) and I find it especially amusing that both the earl;y wagon frontrunners who were at each other's throats are now on the same \"team\"...or wagon. I especially do not like Monkey's L-1 vote. Because of Matt's convincing case? WTF? Matt didn't even vote her. And his case was by no means a slam dunk. Did you expect someone with a PR to make some sort of comment early in the game that would give anyone the idea that she could be a PR? And despite saying we needed to not lynch her and that Yates was still the scummiest player, you proceed to give him crap for considering bowing down to her flailing? How is that not playing both sides of the fence?<br>\n<br>\nThere is no reason we should not let -L- make it to N1 at least, see if she is able to get any result, or let her draw a kill away from the rest of us. And if she makes it to D2 and her claim results don't give us a warm fuzzy...eliminate her tomorrow.<br>\n<br>\nCalling BS on Monkey's recent posting wrt -L-.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Monkey</span></div></blockquote><br>\nThe -L- lynch was bullshit.

How to get a townie lynched 101, by Norlkaz.</div></blockquote><br>\nFine, I'll go one more round.<br>\n0. The Slandaar kill makes you more likely to be scum because a team with you on it is more likely to kill Slandaar than a team without you on it.<br>\n<br>\nWere Slandaar left alive, he would probably have continued attacking you.<br>\nIf you're town, this would benefit scum, so he'd have been more likely left alive and Qwints or I killed instead.<br>\nNeither Qwints nor I are particularly easy to predict the behavior of based on our play yesterday, both of us are good players, and both of us are highly unlikely to get lynched. <br>\nSlandaar, on the other hand, was even on some suspect lists. <br>\nIf you're scum, Slandaar is a much higher priority target because he directly threatens you.<br>\n<br>\nIs it possible that scum killed Slandaar thinking he was a PR?<br>\nYes. This option neither favors nor hurts your scum-likelihood.<br>\n<br>\nIs it possible that scum killed Slandaar seeking to implicate you?<br>\nThat is less likely, because it's hard to predict how town's reads will be affected by nightkilling a particular player.<br>\nThis is the case you are referring to when you say \"WIFOM.\"<br>\nGoing one level deeper, it is actually reasonably likely that you believed town would overvalue this possibility and let you get away with saying \"WIFOMWIFOMWIFOM\" when you killed Slandaar.<br>\n<br>\nIn the end, while it is fully possible a team without you on it killed Slandaar, his death makes it more likely that you are scum.<br>\n<br>\n\"WIFOM\" is not a 'valid point in response' (to use your term) to the above line of reasoning. You are simply mentioning a particular, somewhat unlikely explanation of what happened which I already took into account before making the statement \"The Slandaar kill makes you more likely to be scum.\"<br>\n<br>\n2 &amp; 4. 100% town wagons are intrinsically more likely to occur on scum than town (relative to random) for several reasons.<br>\nFirst and simplest, a scum isn't going to be on his or her own wagon. This means the pool of townies available for wagon participation is larger relative to the pool of scum than normal, increasing the probability of a 100% town wagon.<br>\n<br>\nNext, town are in general better than random at voting for scum. Were they not, scum would have dominant win percentages (most setups require town to lynch better than random to win, and the scum voting block / elimination of accurate players stack the deck further). Thus a player several townies want lynched is a good person to lynch. Especially when there is no evidence that scum also desire the lynch (100% town wagon).<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, scum want to help townies be wrong. They tend to support wagons on town by town by joining them rather than doing their own thing.<br>\n(This is separately a reason HD's sheeping of wagons on people who have flipped town D1 is scummy)<br>\nThus the absence of scum from a wagon is an indicator that it may be on scum.<br>\n<br>\n\"Townies can be wrong\" is not a 'valid point in response' to the above line of reasoning. You are simply mentioning another explanation of what happened which I already took into account before making the statement \"Your 100% town wagon yesterday and Qwints' vote make you more likely to be scum.\"<br>\n<br>\n3. Most of your responses to Slandaar's points are similar to your responses to the above - you can come up with a reason town did practically anything, but that doesn't mean the action pointed out does not increase the odds you're scum.<br>\n<br>\nHappy?", "time": "Sat Jan 26, 2013 5:44 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=25071&start=1075", "forum": "53", "thread": "25071"}

I don't believe there are any rules against speculating on why someone replaced out. I do believe that replacements are a null tell because non-alignment related reasons tend to dominate there.<br>\n<br>\nI am confused by the fact that you're pushing this case because it has a lot of nonsensical conjecture - distancing/bussing is a universal strategy mafia/werewolf, and I know you're familiar with it because of post <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4650720#p4650720\" class=\"postlink\">570</a>. Two mafia team mates are the least likely to actually be offended in harsh exchanges since 1)they know they're allied; and 2) those exchanges are often faked. In fact, seeing two players who are genuinely annoyed at each other is one of the best tells that they're not on the same team since it's hard to fake. <br>\n<br>\nOn top of that, you think the mod decided to intervene in a alignment-specific way. I can't imagine any decent mod saying \"I don't think scum team is doing a good job playing together, so I better replace one.\" And I don't really think you could actually believe that.<br>\n<br>\nSo why are you pushing this far-fetched case? I think it's because you want to make a novel case against a player who looks pretty scummy and has a fair amount of suspicion against him. If it wasn't for the way you attacked him today, my vote would still be on HD. Here's how I see your style: make cases on people who have some suspicion on them then cheer the wagon while trying to be one of the least responsible ones for the wagon.

Nobody wants to get lynched, but town expect appearing townie to happen naturally whereas scum spend a lot of time thinking of how to make it happen.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4640963#p4640963\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4640963#p4640963\" data-post-id=\"4640963\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 92</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16634\">Slandaar</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4640931#p4640931\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4640931#p4640931\" data-post-id=\"4640931\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 80</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20281\">Human Destroyer</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nAlso I actually had to backpedal there, I was blatantly wrong; it's a damned if I do, damned if I don't situation.</div></blockquote><br>\nLynch This.<br>\n<br>\nWhy is he damned if he 'backpedals'; he took new information into account ie what he should do as town so where is the damning part?

I'm voting matt right now because I didn't like the way he initially tried to implicate HD with the nk rather than stating the obvious (especially since I'd already made the point by quoting Slandaar's suspicion). The fact that a scummy Matt is pushing the HD lynch in a very similar way to how he pushed the -L- lynch makes me keep my vote on Matt rather than HD.  I think your mistake is not treating Matt as someone who helped lynch a townie.

How to get a townie lynched 101, by Norlkaz.</div></blockquote><br>\nFine, I'll go one more round.<br>\n0. The Slandaar kill makes you more likely to be scum because a team with you on it is more likely to kill Slandaar than a team without you on it.<br>\n<br>\nWere Slandaar left alive, he would probably have continued attacking you.<br>\nIf you're town, this would benefit scum, so he'd have been more likely left alive and Qwints or I killed instead.<br>\nNeither Qwints nor I are particularly easy to predict the behavior of based on our play yesterday, both of us are good players, and both of us are highly unlikely to get lynched. <br>\nSlandaar, on the other hand, was even on some suspect lists. <br>\nIf you're scum, Slandaar is a much higher priority target because he directly threatens you.<br>\n<br>\nIs it possible that scum killed Slandaar thinking he was a PR?<br>\nYes. This option neither favors nor hurts your scum-likelihood.<br>\n<br>\nIs it possible that scum killed Slandaar seeking to implicate you?<br>\nThat is less likely, because it's hard to predict how town's reads will be affected by nightkilling a particular player.<br>\nThis is the case you are referring to when you say \"WIFOM.\"<br>\nGoing one level deeper, it is actually reasonably likely that you believed town would overvalue this possibility and let you get away with saying \"WIFOMWIFOMWIFOM\" when you killed Slandaar.<br>\n<br>\nIn the end, while it is fully possible a team without you on it killed Slandaar, his death makes it more likely that you are scum.<br>\n<br>\n\"WIFOM\" is not a 'valid point in response' (to use your term) to the above line of reasoning. You are simply mentioning a particular, somewhat unlikely explanation of what happened which I already took into account before making the statement \"The Slandaar kill makes you more likely to be scum.\"<br>\n<br>\n2 &amp; 4. 100% town wagons are intrinsically more likely to occur on scum than town (relative to random) for several reasons.<br>\nFirst and simplest, a scum isn't going to be on his or her own wagon. This means the pool of townies available for wagon participation is larger relative to the pool of scum than normal, increasing the probability of a 100% town wagon.<br>\n<br>\nNext, town are in general better than random at voting for scum. Were they not, scum would have dominant win percentages (most setups require town to lynch better than random to win, and the scum voting block / elimination of accurate players stack the deck further). Thus a player several townies want lynched is a good person to lynch. Especially when there is no evidence that scum also desire the lynch (100% town wagon).<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, scum want to help townies be wrong. They tend to support wagons on town by town by joining them rather than doing their own thing.<br>\n(This is separately a reason HD's sheeping of wagons on people who have flipped town D1 is scummy)<br>\nThus the absence of scum from a wagon is an indicator that it may be on scum.<br>\n<br>\n\"Townies can be wrong\" is not a 'valid point in response' to the above line of reasoning. You are simply mentioning another explanation of what happened which I already took into account before making the statement \"Your 100% town wagon yesterday and Qwints' vote make you more likely to be scum.\"<br>\n<br>\n3. Most of your responses to Slandaar's points are similar to your responses to the above - you can come up with a reason town did practically anything, but that doesn't mean the action pointed out does not increase the odds you're scum.<br>\n<br>\nHappy?</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4678780#p4678780\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4678780#p4678780\" data-post-id=\"4678780\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1114</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20618\">Norlkaz</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4678497#p4678497\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4678497#p4678497\" data-post-id=\"4678497\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1100</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19685\">penguin_alien</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nThe backtracking thing as far as I can tell was someone admitting he was wrong in an assumption about another player's experience; not exactly damning.

Instead of just going 'ah, okay; I was wrong' and moving his vote he proceeded with \"this is going to look scummy, but if I preemptively say I realize it will look that way then I should seem town for not caring and proceeding anyway.\" That line of thought is scummy because it shows that appearing not scummy is highly important to his play. I've actually caught myself doing the same thing a couple times as scum (noticing yourself doing strange things as scum is a lot of how you find scumtells in the first place). Nobody wants to get lynched, but town expect appearing townie to happen naturally whereas scum spend a lot of time thinking of how to make it happen.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4640963#p4640963\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4640963#p4640963\" data-post-id=\"4640963\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 92</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16634\">Slandaar</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4640931#p4640931\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4640931#p4640931\" data-post-id=\"4640931\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 80</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20281\">Human Destroyer</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nAlso I actually had to backpedal there, I was blatantly wrong; it's a damned if I do, damned if I don't situation.</div></blockquote><br>\nLynch This.<br>\n<br>\nWhy is he damned if he 'backpedals'; he took new information into account ie what he should do as town so where is the damning part?

I don't believe there are any rules against speculating on why someone replaced out. I do believe that replacements are a null tell because non-alignment related reasons tend to dominate there.<br>\n<br>\nI am confused by the fact that you're pushing this case because it has a lot of nonsensical conjecture - distancing/bussing is a universal strategy mafia/werewolf, and I know you're familiar with it because of post <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4650720#p4650720\" class=\"postlink\">570</a>. Two mafia team mates are the least likely to actually be offended in harsh exchanges since 1)they know they're allied; and 2) those exchanges are often faked. In fact, seeing two players who are genuinely annoyed at each other is one of the best tells that they're not on the same team since it's hard to fake. <br>\n<br>\nOn top of that, you think the mod decided to intervene in a alignment-specific way. I can't imagine any decent mod saying \"I don't think scum team is doing a good job playing together, so I better replace one.\" And I don't really think you could actually believe that.<br>\n<br>\nSo why are you pushing this far-fetched case? I think it's because you want to make a novel case against a player who looks pretty scummy and has a fair amount of suspicion against him. If it wasn't for the way you attacked him today, my vote would still be on HD.

I'm voting matt right now because I didn't like the way he initially tried to implicate HD with the nk rather than stating the obvious (especially since I'd already made the point by quoting Slandaar's suspicion). The fact that a scummy Matt is pushing the HD lynch in a very similar way to how he pushed the -L- lynch makes me keep my vote on Matt rather than HD.

I don't see how asking someone for clarification is a tell.  I try to act the same as town as I do as scum.   I would have asked the same question if I was town.   Maybe I tend to comment on things too much for my own good, but Yates uses meta cases and appeal to authority way too much.   Town players should seek to involve other teammates opinions and not put themselves above the rest of the team.", "time": "Wed Feb 13, 2013 5:25 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=25071&start=1375", "forum": "53", "thread": "25071"}
