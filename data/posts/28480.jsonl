If you haven't responded to me by then, I'll be forced to replace you.<br>12) In the event a deadline is reached, it will become a no lynch by default.<br>13) Once you die, you're dead.

Why are you attacking one player for responding to a joke with a joke, but ignoring another player who opens with jokes after serious discussion has started. He's applying two different standards to two different players. That's not town. Motivations behind that, of course, remain up in the air, but there's no such motivation for town (unless he's a mason, but the probability of that is on the extreme low side)."}

It's still anti-town, but probably not scummy. It was, on the other hand, scummy by JMO's stated scumtells, which is why I went after him. If that makes sense. Either way, DCL is worse right now for strawmanning my case on JMO and then not being able to explain why exactly he did that. All he said was that I wrote a messy post, which isn't true, and he couldn't say anything further or explain WHY he perceived it as messy. JMO then leapt into action defending DCL, who also soft-defended JMO by trying to shift me onto TMT in the early-game. Suspicious interactions, for sure."}

Upon further reflection, masons are of limited use to the Town.  Equally, they are lower priority targets for scum.  They are essentially two VT's that can chit chat, right?

Masons are good NKs on mid-late nights, because they are huge problems in lylo but not huge threats early.

Sure, killing a mason guarantees that scum've done better than hitting a VT, but also guarantees that any information roles are getting information.<br><br>2) I don't think you're getting my point. What I'm saying is that a 2nd mason claim now guarantees that we have no masons by the time masons become a useful thing to have, because scum will target the masons once the numbers start dwindling. A second mason claiming now means that it's very likely that the masons will get NK'd as the numbers dwindle.

There is never a situation where we can really make a bargain with the masons at all. We have to rely on the scum making a stupid and actually counter claiming mason in any way. The only thing that it does is to make it a coin flip at the end which in lylo it is already. There is literally no advantage gained. And plus, this contradicts your previous statement that \"Scum don't like to kill masons n1\" because if the town can gain an advantage by having masons around then the scum would kill them. Your arguments propose two contradictory view points where on one hand having masons is good for scum and on the other it is bad.<br><br>I would be willing to do the following as a compromise. I think it is sub-optimal, personally, but it is the second best choice. I propose that we lynch dlc today and that the other mason can claim whenever. Middle of the road, we no for a fact if there are masons in the game or not and you guys get your lylo coin flip."}

The value to town of having one mason left alive is almost null, because the remainder is almost certainly going to be killed that night anyway. Lynching DCL without him naming a partner makes sense, because that leaves the partner free to claim before lylo and give us a confirmed clear on any date. If he names a partner, it makes more sense to leave him alive for now, and who knows? If they're both scum, maybe a cop will check them and give us two confirmed scum at once.<br><br>At this time, I still support a DCLXVI lynch and a CoolDog lynch. Unless I see something else from TMT that makes me think he's scum, I am not willing to support that wagon unless the choice is TMT or a NL."}

I'm looking through his ISO, didn't see anything bad about it up until the Mason claim...</div></blockquote><br><br>Good question, and I can't really speak for others because I was pretty much on cruise control for the early stages of this game*.<br><br>For me, it was his shiftiness over seeing why I called Radiant town. He didn't get it and then he saw why I did it and never really explained that transition.<br><br>It still niggles at me because I actually did base my on <span style=\"font-style: italic\">something</span>, just not anything generally considered obvious or any kind of universal tell, and its something that could be spun as town or scum so it is doubly moot. Radiant had counted the 10 confirms needed to start the game and did so, which read like a tad of newbish enthusiasm. I wouldn't expect scum to do the same- as a rule, scum want to go unseen- so I went with town. Wiggle the wifom dial and you can go back and forth as desired.<br><br>So I took a plunge from my normal RVS move of 'vote the person with the most votes with no explanation' and decided to see how moving the game this way worked. Because I'd never done it, I didn't really have anything to base my expectations on.<br><br>Now, DCL joining in the calls for more explanation was sensible, fishing a reason for the knowledge and then being all chill with it raised my hackles and I poked. And others poked. And his claim was to use the fishing portion of that wobble as a breadcrumb.<br><br>Because the \"breadcrumb\" first read like fishing, I was hesistant to buy into it. Had Radiant or I coyly acknowledged that possibility, no doubt scum-DCL would see it as a boon to have helped ID masons. But we didn't, obv, so he later falls back on it \"I was crumbing\".<br><br>And suddenly (I just thought)- why do masons need to crumb? They have each other...they go \"TA-DA! We are MASONS!\" and the scum tremble and the town rejoices. Was the crumb a hedge against one of them dying? Seems way early to be worried about that.<br><br>*On me cruising, my wife was yesterday admitted to the hospital for the 4th time in &lt;30 days. We've had at-home nurse care for a week and a half, I've been playing nurse taking off time...it's been a crazy ride and she is having an exploratory surgery tomorrow, so my VLA will be extended (I'm blowing off work duties for the last half hour), but I am just as likely to be posting like crazy from hospital wi-fi."}

In order to put this role into a setup, you would need to balance the entire setup around it - it would not help to balance anything. I'm thinking especially about the compulsive modifier. The only reason to tack on compulsive is to force the vig shot to be used. The goal of doing this is to weaken town power by removing the choice of whether or not to use the shot. BUT, if you seriously wanted to weaken town power, then you would never put the compulsive vig shot into a JOAT. It's very likely that the shot would never be used due to, well, exactly this. It would be much better to just remove the compulsive vig shot and take off an ability from the JOAT, making it just a 1-shot role, or reduce town power elsewhere.<br><br>This claim is not a role that would fly through a review process."}

The only reason to tack on compulsive is to force the vig shot to be used. The goal of doing this is to weaken town power by removing the choice of whether or not to use the shot. BUT, if you seriously wanted to weaken town power, then you would never put the compulsive vig shot into a JOAT. It's very likely that the shot would never be used due to, well, exactly this.

This is due to the quick turn-around from Radiant when Hoopla told him he NEEDED to confirm his role. These are things previously said by many others in the game, but Radiant did not listen to those. He didn't hesitate to take the advice of Hoopla though. This DOES NOT mean either Radiant or Hoopla is scum by itself - it's possible a town-Radiant was willing to accept town-Hoopla's advice because he had a town read on Hoopla or respected Hoopla's ability in the game. If one flips scum, though, take a hard look at the other.<br><br>Roflcopter is doing two things this game.<br>1) Pissing me off.<br>2) Oh wait, he's only pissing me off.

TMT has played anti-town in all the ways I would expect noob-town to do so. He has done nothing inherently scummy or that can not be understood when looking at things from the mindset of someone new to the game of Mafia and on the town side of things. The only thing that makes me iffy on TMT is that Cooldog has been kind of weird about him. He started off reading TMT as relatively scummy (never placed a vote, though). He then moved towards saying TMT was a decent vote but not the best. More recently, up against deadline, he has avoided the topic for the most part and hasn't placed a vote, despite considering TMT a decent lynch (in his own words). I see no reason based on Cooldog's read of TMT that a vote should not have been placed, considering this is the last day before deadline. TMT should have been a very valid compromise lynch for Cooldog based on his posting. This is another dependent read - if TMT or Cooldog flips scum, take a hard look at the other one.<br><br>If I have to compromise on TMT at deadline tomorrow, I'll do so, but I really don't want to. Cooldog is a much better target and I'm regretting my move off him that helped shift momentum away from that wagon."}

The only way to make that determination is to find out why ROFL is claiming CoolDog - who was in lynch position - is Town.

In fact, (c) gives scum a perfect target to kill. Thus, (b) is strictly better than (c). The difference between (a) and (b) is that in (b) scum know that Radiant will commute on N3, but scum have no knowledge for (a).

This seems odd.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5045001#p5045001\" class=\"postlink\">post 720</a>, ThAdmiral wrote:</cite>I think there are probably better lynches today than nhammen who hasn't jumped out at me as scum, then again scum are probably in the \"haven't jumped out at me as scum\" pile, so I'm torn on this. Would still prefer to lynch gorckat, but I will have a look back at some of the other wagons that formed in this game to see if I can figure anything out.</div></blockquote><br><br>Waiting for this.<br><br>CooLDoG I do not dislike your vote but you're reasoning is meh.<br><br>Hmmm other than all this not much has changed for me. I need to do an ISO of gorckat to see what I think there but that isn't time urgent because I don't want to lynch there today. I want to lynch off the DCL wagon.<br><br>And yes I'm aware of the risk here but frankly I'm super willing to take that risk at this point."}

He was on the early tmt wagon with the only other unknown being jmo for much of the time. Furthermore he was on the cooldog wagon, being one unknown out of hoopla(does bo know), nhammen and himself, before getting back on the tmt wagon for its lynch. Finally he was also on the yates lynch. I don't really blame the people on the yates lynch, due to how he was acting it was inevitable he was going to be lynched.

I think I called half of the living player derp.<br><br>But I had the scumteam as rofl/admiral/jmo. But now I'm not sure. A ctrl-f search of each of you reveals that you didn't mention each other almost at all.

That means that, as a bus, this is a really smart bus because it pushes town to start searching for scum in a group of four that very likely included the mason and a group that, given a single scum in that group, would actually be LESS scum-dense than the overall game, so as scum he could potentially push for 3-4 mislynches in that group by only giving up gorck.

In addition to my low impact catching up with me, the hoops I jumped through to justify my cooldog read were deadly. But all of my \"scumreads\" had either been confirmed or lynched, so he was the only one left. That's why scum should always have some scumreads that wont be lynched.
