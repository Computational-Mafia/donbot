Either way, DCL is worse right now for strawmanning my case on JMO and then not being able to explain why exactly he did that. All he said was that I wrote a messy post, which isn't true, and he couldn't say anything further or explain WHY he perceived it as messy.

What I'm saying is that a 2nd mason claim now guarantees that we have no masons by the time masons become a useful thing to have, because scum will target the masons once the numbers start dwindling. A second mason claiming now means that it's very likely that the masons will get NK'd as the numbers dwindle. Also, if it's stupid for scum to counterclaim mason, why wouldn't you want them to make that move?

Also, again, why the fuck would scum ever counterclaim mason before lylo?</div></blockquote>\n2 is fair, except that as you point out scum will never counter claim mason. There is never a situation where we can really make a bargain with the masons at all. We have to rely on the scum making a stupid and actually counter claiming mason in any way. The only thing that it does is to make it a coin flip at the end which in lylo it is already. There is literally no advantage gained. And plus, this contradicts your previous statement that \"Scum don't like to kill masons n1\" because if the town can gain an advantage by having masons around then the scum would kill them. Your arguments propose two contradictory view points where on one hand having masons is good for scum and on the other it is bad.<br>\n<br>\nI would be willing to do the following as a compromise. I think it is sub-optimal, personally, but it is the second best choice. I propose that we lynch dlc today and that the other mason can claim whenever.

He had no reason to believe that gorkcat was being town, and dodging questions is generally scummy in its own right, whereas subtly pushing on you is only scummy if he has no or sloppy justification for it.

He's being compliant and asking others for their opinions, instead of having the balls to decide for himself what he thinks is best for the town.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, every single person in the game noticed that I was self voting.

Only scum need to point out that their thought process isn't scummy in this manner; it's not argumentative, it's just matter of fact.

The value to town of having one mason left alive is almost null, because the remainder is almost certainly going to be killed that night anyway. Lynching DCL without him naming a partner makes sense, because that leaves the partner free to claim before lylo and give us a confirmed clear on any date. If he names a partner, it makes more sense to leave him alive for now, and who knows? If they're both scum, maybe a cop will check them and give us two confirmed scum at once.<br>\n<br>\nAt this time, I still support a DCLXVI lynch and a CoolDog lynch.

He didn't get it and then he saw why I did it and never really explained that transition.<br>\n<br>\nIt still niggles at me because I actually did base my on <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">something</div>, just not anything generally considered obvious or any kind of universal tell, and its something that could be spun as town or scum so it is doubly moot. Radiant had counted the 10 confirms needed to start the game and did so, which read like a tad of newbish enthusiasm. I wouldn't expect scum to do the same- as a rule, scum want to go unseen- so I went with town. Wiggle the wifom dial and you can go back and forth as desired.<br>\n<br>\nSo I took a plunge from my normal RVS move of 'vote the person with the most votes with no explanation' and decided to see how moving the game this way worked. Because I'd never done it, I didn't really have anything to base my expectations on.<br>\n<br>\nNow, DCL joining in the calls for more explanation was sensible, fishing a reason for the knowledge and then being all chill with it raised my hackles and I poked. And others poked. And his claim was to use the fishing portion of that wobble as a breadcrumb.<br>\n<br>\nBecause the \"breadcrumb\" first read like fishing, I was hesistant to buy into it. Had Radiant or I coyly acknowledged that possibility, no doubt scum-DCL would see it as a boon to have helped ID masons. But we didn't, obv, so he later falls back on it \"I was crumbing\".<br>\n<br>\nAnd suddenly (I just thought)- why do masons need to crumb? They have each other...they go \"TA-DA! We are MASONS!\" and the scum tremble and the town rejoices. Was the crumb a hedge against one of them dying?

In order to put this role into a setup, you would need to balance the entire setup around it - it would not help to balance anything. I'm thinking especially about the compulsive modifier. The only reason to tack on compulsive is to force the vig shot to be used. The goal of doing this is to weaken town power by removing the choice of whether or not to use the shot. BUT, if you seriously wanted to weaken town power, then you would never put the compulsive vig shot into a JOAT. It's very likely that the shot would never be used due to, well, exactly this.

I interpret that as meaning that you are scum and don't actually care which town gets lynched, so you don't need to scumhunt. Even the most towny explanation involves acting anti-town.<br>\n<br>\nI consider it more likely than that that you planned to bait me into getting roleblocked when I tried to vig shoot you, and then use that opportunity to push for a mislynch onto me. And your actions all point towards that; after chastising me for not working hard enough in my defense, you are telling me to shoot what would be (if you were town) a confirmed innocent. That's extremely anti town, especially considering unlike me you aren't even giving any reads as you go down. I think that I was dead on about your ploy, that you are scum with cooldog, and are backed into a corner now and are beginning to become resigned to this loss.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>he's claimed a massively improbably role.</div></blockquote>\n\nYou need to stop saying that.<br>\n<br>\nWhen I die or the game ends and my role is confirmed, take my role and go bitch to the normal review board or whoever's job you feel it is to prevent a role like this from getting into a mafia game.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>\"You are a Statistician (Town)!

This is due to the quick turn-around from Radiant when Hoopla told him he NEEDED to confirm his role. These are things previously said by many others in the game, but Radiant did not listen to those. He didn't hesitate to take the advice of Hoopla though. This DOES NOT mean either Radiant or Hoopla is scum by itself - it's possible a town-Radiant was willing to accept town-Hoopla's advice because he had a town read on Hoopla or respected Hoopla's ability in the game. If one flips scum, though, take a hard look at the other.<br>\n<br>\nRoflcopter is doing two things this game.<br>\n1) Pissing me off.<br>\n2) Oh wait, he's only pissing me off.

TMT has played anti-town in all the ways I would expect noob-town to do so. He has done nothing inherently scummy or that can not be understood when looking at things from the mindset of someone new to the game of Mafia and on the town side of things. The only thing that makes me iffy on TMT is that Cooldog has been kind of weird about him. He started off reading TMT as relatively scummy (never placed a vote, though). He then moved towards saying TMT was a decent vote but not the best. More recently, up against deadline, he has avoided the topic for the most part and hasn't placed a vote, despite considering TMT a decent lynch (in his own words). I see no reason based on Cooldog's read of TMT that a vote should not have been placed, considering this is the last day before deadline. TMT should have been a very valid compromise lynch for Cooldog based on his posting. This is another dependent read - if TMT or Cooldog flips scum, take a hard look at the other one.<br>\n<br>\nIf I have to compromise on TMT at deadline tomorrow, I'll do so, but I really don't want to.

I'm slightly wavering on your alignment, although not for this reason. A more compelling reason for you being town, is the makeup of your early wagon - it had a lot of neutral/null people on it (in my eyes), and there's a good chance at least one of them is scum, making it slightly more difficult for you to be scum.<br>\n<br>\nBut like someone else said (gorckat), it's almost getting to a point where we just need to get a lynch sorted.

What makes you think he'd even be alive D4?</div></blockquote>\nI just realized that my earlier post said we would need to assume Radiant is town for this to be optimal, but we actually would need to assume he is town and not lying.<br>\nThere are 3 possibilities for non-fakeclaiming-Radiant:<br>\n1) Radiant investigates N2 and gets a guilty<br>\n2) Radiant investigates N2 and gets an innocent<br>\n3) Radiant commutes N2 and investigates N3<br>\n<br>\nFor 1, Radiant would claim immediately (he better!)<br>\n<br>\nFor 2, there are 3 options for D3:<br>\na) no claim<br>\nb) claim innocent but not who was investigated<br>\nc) fully claim innocent<br>\nFor (b) and (c), scum know that Radiant will commute N3, and will not kill him. In fact, (c) gives scum a perfect target to kill. Thus, (b) is strictly better than (c). The difference between (a) and (b) is that in (b) scum know that Radiant will commute on N3, but scum have no knowledge for (a). This means that the only difference is that in (a), scum have a chance to hit a commuting Radiant and get no kill. Thus (a) is strictly better than (b).<br>\n<br>\nFor 3, there are 2 options for D3:<br>\nclaim the commute or not<br>\nIf Radiant claims a commute on D3, then scum know that he can be killed N3, and will kill him to remove a power role and prevent his investigation from going off.<br>\nIf Radiant does not claim a commute on D3, then scum are left in the dark and might choose not to target him because they don't know if this is case 2 or 3. Thus, no claim is strictly better than claiming a commute.<br>\n<br>\nThus, in both case 2 and 3, no claim is the best option.

He was on the early tmt wagon with the only other unknown being jmo for much of the time. Furthermore he was on the cooldog wagon, being one unknown out of hoopla(does bo know), nhammen and himself, before getting back on the tmt wagon for its lynch.
