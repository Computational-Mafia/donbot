I am the mod, and therefore I have the right to change, modify, or arbitrate as I see fit.  As a mod, I will make it my goal to be as just, consistent and not-arbitrary as possible.<br><br>1. Do not discuss the game outside of the thread unless your role specifically allows it, and then only in the manner allowed in your PM.  Similarly, do not quote any outside communications (this includes role PMs).<br><br>2. If you have any questions or spot any errors, PM me or post in <span class=\"noboldsig\">bold</span>.  I will be searching the thread for bolded text, so please refrain from using it outside votes and mod communication.<br><br>3. If I need to modkill anyone, that player will become a Neutral Survivor and lose the game.  Also, any modkill will either end the day or not depending on what is most detrimental to their faction.  I do not want to use this power, so do not make me.<br><br>4. <span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Blue</span></span> is the mod color.  Do not use it.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Gameplay</span><br><br>5. Votes are in bold.  Ex: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Exe</span>  The player's name need not be exact, but should be obvious.<br><br>6. Please unvote before voting again.  I will not require it, but a lack of an unvote may cause me to mistake the votecount.<br><br>7.  Voting for a <span class=\"noboldsig\">no lynch</span> is allowed.<br><br>8. Lynch happens when a majority is reached. Hitting the deadline without a successful majority will result in a <span class=\"noboldsig\">no lynch</span>.<br><br>9. When you are dead, you are dead.  Bah posts are silly.<br><br>10. Once a majority is reached, the game enters \u201ctwilight.\u201d  Unvoting at this point will not stop the lynch, however all players may talk until I have locked the thread and posted a death scene.<br><br>11. Please follow general mafia rules regarding posts: no secret code, no invisible text, and absolutely no editing posts.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Activity and Deadlines</span><br><br>12.  Game days will last 2 weeks, with an extension for exceptional circumstances.<br><br>13.  Night phases last 3 days, no exception.<br><br>14.  Lurking is not a viable strategy, and as such you are expected to post regularly.  After 48 hours without posting, you will be prodded.  Another day without posting after that is a forced replace.  I will only prod a player once.  Please notify me if you expect to be V/LA.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Sportsmanship</span><br>15. Ad hominem &amp; personal attacks are not acceptable.  I am not your babysitter and will not actively watch for ad hom, but if a player complains of inappropriate behavior I will take the request very seriously.  Please play nice.<br><br>16.  Have fun.  This is a game, of course.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Sample Townie Role PM:</span><br>At least 1 person in this game has the following role:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Hi, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">name</span> you are a <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span>.

No-one so far has given off anything that can definitively be said is a solid scumtell so far, there is little reason why town would be attached so strongly to one player.

I must prove it to them\".<br>I usually am quite reliant to give the \"newbie pass\" to cover up scummy things, but I think what bgg did was completely anti-town (claiming VT and such.) but there is nothing actually scummy in there.<br><br>________<br>The major reason for me to believe Xine to be scum is <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2793183#p2793183\" class=\"postlink\">post 121</a>: I really see this as blatant opportunism on the easiest wagon (a newbtown.)

One scum, one town.  Two scummy, two townish.  Six null.  I mean, aside from the fact that he posted a list in which he listed half the game as null, it just feels too damn even.  Makes one wonder if he perhaps wanted it to look like that.  It's especially strange when combined with this:<blockquote><div><cite>Nathanael wrote:</cite>Sometimes it is much easier to go looking for town-reads than for scum-reads. And then you have to find scum based on you town-reads. Well, this is one of those cases.</div></blockquote>If it's easier for him to find town reads in this game than scum reads, then why does he have the same number of town and scum reads.  Even aside from that, if he's really hunting from process of elimination like he seems to be implying, how is he doing so if he had null reads on literally half of the game?<br><br>Deadline is in under 3 days.  We need to start making something happen here and I don't see a better option out there than Nathanael.  I'm seeing Neruz as town, Xine as neutral-slightly scummy and bgg as a big distraction.  If we can't get a wagon on Nathanael in time, I'd be willing to vote Xine.  I would not as of now be particularly happy with a Neruz lynch."}

(no sarcasm/irony meant.)<br>Small hint: I do believe you are scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>bgg1996 wrote:</cite>Anyway, the reason for the switch, is at the beginning I was a little bit afraid of dying in the first round, not having enough fun, so I didn't want to look too helpful, else the mafia might kill me. <br>After there was a big wagon against me, I figured that the mafia wasn't going to kill me, because I was suspicious and could be helpful to them later by pulling the attention away from them. Like a shield. That was when I believed it was safe to actively scumhunt. It's not an honorable, or popular reason, but it's the real one.</div></blockquote><br>This just made you lose every bit of town-read I had on you.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>DeathRowKitty wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Nathanael wrote:</cite>Sometimes it is much easier to go looking for town-reads than for scum-reads. And then you have to find scum based on you town-reads. Well, this is one of those cases.</div></blockquote>If it's easier for him to find town reads in this game than scum reads, then why does he have the same number of town and scum reads.  Even aside from that, if he's really hunting from process of elimination like he seems to be implying, how is he doing so if he had null reads on literally half of the game?</div></blockquote><br>I found one solid town-read, namely bgg (even if the quoted post shattered it lately.), and then tried to deduce my scumreads from it. This means that of course the scumreads were dependent of my town-read, and now I have to rethink quite a bit (this is why I don't have Xine so scummy anymore.) Also, I never said or implied that I was going by PoE. I just said that if one (in this case only one) strong town read sticks out, one can get more by looking for scum based on that townread.<br><blockquote><div><cite>DeathRowKitty wrote:</cite>This is going to sound a bit nit-picky, buuuuut.....does it bother anyone else that his list of reads is <span class=\"noboldsig\">completely</span> symmetrical?  One scum, one town.  Two scummy, two townish.  Six null.  I mean, aside from the fact that he posted a list in which he listed half the game as null, it just feels too damn even.  Makes one wonder if he perhaps wanted it to look like that.</div></blockquote><br>This is actually interesting. Probably gaussian distribution pops up more than one might think. I don't really have an explanation for why it turned up that way. Probably since the distinction between scum/scummy and even scummy/null is usually quite fuzzy, it can be that I tended to order the list more by compared scummyness than by stand-alone scummyness, which could be a reason for the list turning up symmetrical. <br><br>However, do you really think having 6 null-reads is scummy? I don't know you. Of course, while the game progresses and people (hopefully scummy ones) die, I manage to refine the lists, but without flips and further progress, usually I don't manage to get a solid read on significantly more than half the living players. <br><br>____________<br><br>Here is my updated list (from scum to town):<br>Neruz = Surprise_Carcinogen &gt; Xine &gt; bgg = Hiraki &gt; Llamarble &gt; DeathRowKitty = Ant_to_the_max = [Redacted] = Greedling = My Milked Eek &gt; GreyICE<br>I would agree with lynching anyone of the first five. In particular this means that I will vote Xine if deadline requires, even if I would prefer Neruz or S_C atm."}

His recent behavior has me way more convinced than I was earlier; it was at least somewhat hard to tell if he was faking or not then. Now he's confirmed for us that he was. Saying he's all \"excited to be actively scumhunting now\" just feels so much more like trying to look town than like actually playing to the town wincondition. His scumhunting so far consists of attacking Neruz for \"being willing to vote someone he knows to be town,\" which obviously isn't the game situation. His voting record is the horrible L-2 quicklynch seeking vote on Xine which he followed up by wifomavalancheing when called out for it. That and voting Neruz, whose wagon looks pretty scummy to me."}

The constant refrain of innocence they have produced for Neruz has been one of the most baffling things about this thread, especially in the early pages, as early as 4 I think when people were still in RVS and already proclaiming his innocence?<br> <br>That being said, I will just have to hope I am wrong about them, because there's really just no way to ignore bgg's actions this game.<br> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote bgg1996</span> <br> <br>From the first post in this game, bgg softclaimed town:<br> <br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Btw, mafia: Please don't kill me on the first night? </div></blockquote> and virtually every post he made in the first few pages of the game to greater or lesser extents were softclaims.<br> <br>Until he unexpectedly and without reason hardclaimed vanilla town.  This, at the time, some people were willing to sweep under the rug since he came off as newb town and perhaps stupid.  <br> <br>However, bgg in the time since has come off as actually clever, and not nearly so newbish as he initially seemed.  So why these initial antics of soft and hardclaims?<br> <br>Apparently, it was a trap (cue stupid graphic of Admiral Ackbar here).<br> <br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>With it said that way, why would you tell everybody to \"see what his proof is tomorrow. If he is unable to provide proof that he is not scum tomorrow then we will have a direct contradiction from him, which is a powerful scum tell.\" You went on to vote Nathanael. <br>With me claiming VT, what reason could you possibly have for believing that I had proof, regardless of what I actually said?</div></blockquote><br> <br>Why would bgg put out the claim of being able to produce evidence tomorrow if he himself so quickly accepts that doing so is absurd?  At this point, it more or less seems that bgg deliberately produced an absurd claim just to see if anyone would accept it, in the hope of calling out whoever accepted it.<br> <br>As a fishing gambit, this might not be the WORST out there (better than a self-vote at least), but it's still pretty bad and, I think, far more anti-town than town.<br> <br>However, this has not just served as a fishing tactic for bgg, instead he worked very hard to actually try to more-or-less transform this into a wagon on Neruz.<br> <br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>My vote is between:<br><br>Neruz, for among other things, contradictions and hypocracies.<br><br>Surprise_Carcinogen, for being so adamant about me being lynched and a few logical fallacies. </div></blockquote><br> <br>This is like, the only time bgg mentions Surprise_Carcinogen, and he never really addressed the logical fallacies he claimed to have seen.  At this point, whatever logical fallacies he saw for S_C is irrelevant.  What's important here is that he didn't vote for Neruz yet.  I see this post as one of several where bgg basically tried to present himself as not tunneling, and not simply throwing an omgus vote on Neruz.  <br> <br>Then we get to bgg's vote on Neruz himself:<br> <br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I told myself the next time you posted, had at least three sentences, a quote, and the word \"fuck\". And have not yet answered any questions or otherwise contributed to our victory, that would be the point where I stopped making idle threats and actually put your life on the line. <br><br>Vote:Neruz</div></blockquote><br> <br>Although bgg did elsewhere sort of hint at reasons he might see Neruz as guilty, it's interesting that the main reasons he lists right before his vote are more based on characterizing Neruz as incoherent and emotionally laden.  This is very problematic for me, especially when bgg very clearly was provoking Neruz and pretty much everyone else in the thread:<br> <br>Some examples:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Or maybe he is actually smart (doubtful) <br><br>In case your incredibly thick head still does not get it, <br><br>Either that or they are too stupid to remember the difference between me and Xine.</div></blockquote><br> <br>bgg basically does his best to enrages people, and then votes Neruz because he's swearing and coming across as angry?  Yikes.<br> <br>And one of the worst, in retrospect at this point, is this:<br> <br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>In other words, yes I am stupid, but you still have to answer my stupid questions.</div></blockquote><br> <br>I think that really sums it up... bgg set himself up as stupid, provoked other people with his questions, and then at the first person who \"bit\" threw his vote.<br> <br>This is WAY scummy, and he has been so much more dramatically anti-town than anyone else in the game, I don't see how I could really justify a vote on the people I find \"only scummy.\"   <br> <br>I can't deny that in the last few pages bgg has been 'way better' by comparison, but somehow that only makes the first ten pages of this thread even more absurd, because he clearly understands how to play the game and is well capable of rational thought.  To me, his actions this game read like scum tactics trying to trap a potential innocent into a convoluted day one lynch.  <br> <br>I'm still not thrilled with the produced innocence for Neruz from Llamarticle and GreyIce, but I simply can't ignore the player that is way more suspicious.  <br> <br>Also, in the few posts that he's made since he's joined the game, I sort of got the feeling he really wanted me to get on his side; he indirectly agreed with pretty much every point I made, which actually came off as a bit desperate to me.  But then again, it may very well be true that we both don't get the wagon on Xine and that he doesn't need to fake that.<br> <br>End of the line, though, bgg's actions for the first ten pages of this game were either: a) stupid and indirectly anti-town or b) smart and really, really suspicious.  But bgg doesn't strike me, at this point, as dumb or newbish, so at this point he is far and away my top candidate."}

The same is related to 1.<br>Yes bgg, i actually dislike you so much i am willing to waste a perfectly good lynch on ensuring i never have to speak to you ever again.</div></blockquote><br><br>Thank you for finally acknowledging my point, even though is was to bgg. Now do you see how that is a contradiction from earlier in the game when you schooled me on ant-town play and the <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2793040#p2793040\" class=\"postlink\">plan</a> we had consented on?"}

This game has devolved into the same few people arguing the same useless points over and over again.

I have no idea if the person I'm voting right now is scum and honestly couldn't give you a good reason I'm voting him besides \"It just made sense.\"  I'm willing to accept that we're not lynching any of the names I threw out a few days ago and that's probably for the best.  I really have no idea if any of them are scum.<br><br>Our current possibilities seem to be Neruz, Xine, and bgg.  I don't want to lynch Neruz.  I'm still leaning town on Xine.  I'm leaning town on bgg, but would be willing to accept that I could be wrong on him.  If he's town, we lose a VT and put an end to a lot of the pointless debate clogging up the thread.  I would be willing to hammer his lynch at deadline.<br><br>I have one more thought I'd like you to consider though (that I came up with while typing up this post).  We're having trouble with replacements as is and if you look at Ant_to_the_max's iso, it's really not that impressive.  At the very least, it could be a nice counterwagon for anyone thinking the leading wagons are on town.  Of course, we wouldn't be able to get a claim out of him before lynch, but I would like *something* useful to happen here.<br><br>I can post another apple picture if it will help. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\">"}

One accused a beautiful woman.  \u201cHer kind face and her shrouded smile hides a heart of ice!\u201d They cried.  And indeed, her actions fit these words, for she was accusing this noble paladin of plotting to destroy the town.  <br><br>\u201cHe would kill an innocent!\u201d she exclaimed, although she was uncertain of the innocence of the one she protected.  \u201cEven the dark and twisted think he is evil!\u201d she decried, although why the evil was turning upon its own was not mentioned.  Although her voice seemed to lead the crowd, she was not the first to the gathering.  She followed a craftsman.  But where this craftsman probed for reasons and truth, she cried for blood and appealed to the hearts of the crowd.  <br><br>Accusing this woman was a crowd bringing hope to the town but with one dubious figure, for leading it was the strangest of sights.  It was lead by a greedy man who professed to be convinced of her evil by the voice of a harlequin - a voice that professed disbelief alongside its accusations.  Did this greedy man seek to separate himself from the lady with the heart of ice?  The remainder of the voices against her were strong and strident, voices of those who sought to protect the town. <br><br></span>But as both crowds waited for the other actors, a harried director explained that our scene was delayed.  \"A casting call,\" he tells us.<span style=\"font-style: italic\"><br><br>As the director searched for new actors the crowd accusing the woman with the heart of ice began to disperse.  The noble paladin found the man on the hill most curious.  This questioning man provided no reasons or justification.  He did not seem to understand that others would grow to hate that which did not make sense, and he refused to explain himself.   Others found small reasons to turn upon each other, and the woman with the heart of ice was left to her own devices.  She found none of the crowd evil, except the paladin, and offered them no help.  But her darkness became mundane, and the small points grew as the wait extended.  <br><br>As the new actors joined the scene, one stood out.  Standing in for the greedy man was a lunatic, although this lunatic appeared to have a most certain purpose.  He wished others to find the Paladin evil, but also disliked the woman with the heart of ice.  All those who thought the Paladin good were blackguards, although he seemed uncertain of the alignment of the Paladin.  And the most evil was one who seemed to agree with what he was saying, a Harlequin in tattered motley.  <br><br>A new voice arises to quell this din of chaos.  A panther who has left the jungle, and now stalks the ultimate prey.  <br><br>Is it time to abandon the noble <br>And embrace the savage?<br><br>Is this task for a Paladin<br>Or one for a Predator? <br></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Krazy</span>"}

I'm not even going to go into this. His entire play is so bad... <br>Grey voted No lynch. This caught my eye as well.<br>Xine: With an unvote she called out three scum candidates.

Something I don't get is if you're going to call one person scum and accuse them of outing their partner, why vote the partner they outed? That could be scum bussing a town, and voting for the person the scum buddies up to and not the scum's a bad idea in my head.<br>Hiraki addressed llama's use of Meta, to which I didn't feel llama's justification was satisfactory enough. <blockquote><div><cite>Llamarble wrote:</cite>And as for meta earlygame: super early game reasoning is always stretchy. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Anything at all that makes one player feel slightly more likely to be scum is plenty to vote them based on as we go through the stretchy accusation -&gt; discussion -&gt; more confident accusation cycle.</span> So I think using meta earlygame is actually better than using it later on as meta is often misleading anyway.</div></blockquote><br>The justification he gave (which I believe it to be) is bolded, and can be applied to RVS alone without he use of meta-gaming.<br>BTW: The whole thing with Nathanael and Surprise? It's from a webcomic if I am right, which I am 85% certain I am.<br>Then BGG claims VT and role-fishes.

You mean you've gotten this far into the game and haven't even gotten any good reads on at least 2/3 of the players? This just starts the \"I've got to finish my reads of people\" thing he does that I saw Grey call out once. I'm calling it out again, but going to address it in full later.<br>What gets me here is his unvote. I take it as \"oh crap I'm scum and I'm leading the wagon on BGG.

Currently pappums is leading the wagon with Llama in second)<br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2802780#p2802780\" class=\"postlink\">Post 258:</a> This is on page 11. Why bring it up? Between pages 8 and 11, the only new content he has to bring is calling Xine and Neruz town (Wait, wasn't neruz scum to llama a few of his posts back? And again he calls Xine town), and calls Ant scummy. Specifically: <blockquote><div><cite>Llamarble wrote:</cite>Ant looks a bit scummy, particularly if bgg is scum but even if he isn't.</div></blockquote> So, no matter what BGG does Ant is scum... why aren't you placing a vote? This post feels like scum testing out the waters. Here again, \"I still have to read more players though.\" How much time does he need to read players, and why hasn't he done so between pages 8 and 11? Scum stalling, not wanting to get caught pointing fingers without doing so to his advantage. It's at the point that Neruz and BGG start being best enemies together. Eventually Grey joins in, which segway's into<br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2806830#p2806830\" class=\"postlink\">-- 311:</a> <blockquote><div><cite>Llamarble wrote:</cite>I am too tired right now to figure out if Neruz is townflailing or scumflailing.<br>I am leaning more toward town on GreyIce and more toward scum on Xine now though.

And he was in the middle of the bggwagon, as scum often are.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Krazy wrote:</cite>At the moment I think GreyIce is piss-poor town, but if bgg flips town (and Xine by relation) then GreyIce would be in my top 3 with Llamarble and Hiraki.</div></blockquote><br>This, coupled with tunneling on bgg looks like a plan to lynch the easy townie and follow it up by attacking other players all of whom look town to me. I don't see how a bgg townflip exonerates Xine at all; she was hardly reluctant to lynch him. Greedling didn't do anything except wagon Xine though (a reason I found him suspicious yesterday), so Krazyscum doesn't necessarily imply Xinescum regardless.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Krazy</span>"}

I laid the groundwork for a PGO claim early in the day D1, then claimed it at the end of the day when it became apparent I was a good candidate for the Night Kill.  I targeted DRK after working fairly hard yesterday to guide the scum shots onto targets I could protect, and DRK's goodposting and some subtle guidance nearly assured me that the shot was going into him.  His death assures me that I was roleblocked.<br><br>I also can show the PGO claim starting early in the day, subtle moves I did to guide the night kill, and many instances of weird/unusual posting, uncharacteristic lurking, and general bad reads I gave yesterday that, while not scummy, were designed to give them hope that I would be a mislynch.<br><br><br>PEDIT: One shot is EXPLICITLY allowed in normal games."}

This has been bugging me for a while. ._.<br><br>Back on topic I don't buy the bolded. I individually don't like to use meta-gaming, and I don't have time to bother with it myself. This is part to why I don't like it; the other reason is \"I did it over on another site so it's all cool and you guys should just go with it.\" No. The first time you did it, was it here or off-site? The second time is a null-point, as you were killed N1 anyways. Also from my perception of them, marathon games act differently to \"normal\" games, in that things are on-going, not post and wait for replies to come later on in the day/days to come up til deadline. Maybe in marathon games that's cool, but it doesn't apply as far as I know to non-marathon games.<br><br>P.Edit:<br>Ice outed himself because he set up a gambit to expose a scum.

The mod could very well have left out a doctor role. Why would you play with the assumption that, just because there was a cop (you in this example), there'd be a doc?

This is how I look at games in this category.<br>2) Why would a cop reveal their results after a single investigation, all with the idea/mentality of \"hey guys Imma cop X is guilty doc protect me!!\"? I've said why this is a bad idea I think. If not, then I'll propose another idea; what town-motivation is there for assuming play will benefit town based on an unknown quantity?<br>3) What makes you assume that just because a person claims a power role, others will believe it? I direct you to my first newbie game here (newbie 1052) where, apparently, I played my role of doc so well in keeping townies alive that I looked scummy for it, and it took my lynch to prove I was doc.<br>This leads me to my point: What if you false-claimed cop, even if you were just a VT, to try and push for a person you believed to be scum, and only fake-claiming cop would accomplish that? Sure that's scummy in and of itself, but false-claiming a role as town has been done before, I'm aware of that.<br> <br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Thought process:<br>I have a guilty<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">There is PROBABLY a doctor/protective role in this game</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">If I do not out, I might be night-killed<br>If I out too late, it might come off as a desperate fakeclaim</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Okay, the bolded.<br>first line: Why assume that?

Before now, I was operating under the hope that the lynch on GreyIce would go smoothly and that I would have doctor's protection tonight.  Now it is clear neither of those things are true, sadly enough the lynch will fail because I mistakenly assumed there would be a doctor in the game, and thus I have lost my credibility.  <br> <br>Nonetheless, it seems prudent now to review my suspects.  Now that I have realized that the charges by Llamarble, mostly, that my cop role-claim seems \"improbable\" and that he was actually right about this, I have had to seriously re-evaluate my list of suspects.  Previous to that, I was assuming that Llamarble was likely one of GreyIce's team-mates, hoping to lynch the cop.  Now I can see that his suspicions of me were well-grounded and that he was more willing to push his skepticism than I expected.  His current willingness to lynch me as quickly as possible does not strike me as the behavior of someone who knows I will flip town.<br> <br>So at the moment, I personally believe that Llamarble is actually very likely to be innocent, which rather rewrites my entire suspect list.<br> <br>That does not mean, however, that of the people on the wagon on me that all are innocent.  <br> <br>Two of the other more vocal proponents of my wagon have been Neruz and Mute.  Both have rightly shown skepticism of my claims.  Neruz I feel rightly helped me understand why announcing my cop role was so unbelievable for when I did it.  However, for some reason, I have difficulty then saying that he, like Llamarble, really strikes me as innocent.  Mute, on the other hand, seems to be overdoing it, saying, \"I DO NOT FUCKING BUY KRAZY'S GODDAMN CLAIM AND I FUGGIN' THINK IT'S A LOAD O' HORSE SHIT LOADED WITH TNT!!\"  Both Neruz and Mute have started using silly metaphors like sinking-ships filled with aliens or horse shit loaded with TNT.  Both seem to have taken for granted their oppositional position to me before I even announced my role.  I doubt both are scum.  But if I were to point to one over the other, I feel like I would go with Neruz.  He seemed to understand the heart of the problem with me announcing my role fairly quickly, but nevertheless wanted me to just stop talking for a while.  In any case, he also seemed to understand the rules behind GreyIce's PGO claim very well.  Perhaps this simply shows an active understanding of the rules.  But perhaps it also shows he was thinking of GreyIce's claim before now himself. <br> <br>As for the remaining players:<br>Xine<br>-I think made a fair point in at least bringing up the possibility of lynching outside of power-role claims, even if it is a more \"neutral\" position to take.  It isn't neutral at all, actually, considering how likely he was before now to be a top candidate for such a lynch.  I am a little bit more concerned about people who would look at this reasonable suggestion and instantly equate it with guilt, regardless of whether they believed me or GreyIce.<br> <br>Pappums Rat<br>-I'm not really a fan of players that throw around suspicion without building a case around it, and him highlighting Mute's \"bussing\" comment (which I think was benign) without commenting on anything else is problematic.<br> <br>TheButtonmen [Redacted]<br>-The subject of \"a whole post\" by GreyIce, I am trying to understand what Ice wanted to do with him here.  I actually did notice that his post toward me back on D1 had a \"different feel\" than his responses to other players.  I'm not exactly sure what to make of that, and I wasn't sure at the time how to respond (\"Why aren't you poking me more?\")  However, he seemed to be one of the few who noticed that there was something wrong with the wagon on me.  But, similar to my current reading of Neruz who seemed to move too easily to the position of my guilt, I wasn't so sure of how to take this.  <br> <br>Hiraki<br>-I'm personally not a fan of \"gut feelings\" to justify votes, and I'm also not a fan of using those gut feelings to avoid answering the questions that either side is producing.  <br> <br>My Milked Eek<br>-Still waiting on that catch-up post.<br><br>Nathanael<br>-Still hasn't addressed the dialogue between me and GreyIce."}

With this in mind, I think we can focus on the role-interactions (PGO,doc,cop,RB,...) starting almost unbiased between Krazy and GreyICE<br><br>We are now in a curious scenario, where all possible cases (there are 2 of them) are unlikely, and I see a lot of the argument of this thread finally come down to &lt;his story is improbable&gt;.<br>the only statistically useful thing is to compare the two cases.<br>1: Krazy is scum fakeclaiming cop out of the blue, GreyICE is a doc, who gambitted 1shot-PGO possibility, there is a scum RB who blocked GreyICE<br>1a: scum didn't believe the PGO-possibility<br>1b: scum believed the PGO-possibility and decided to trade in a roleblocker (could be Krazy himself) in order to have a good shot at DRK<br>2: GreyICE is scum fakeclaiming cop after preparing it for a while together with a fake 1shot-PGO possibility-claim, Krazy ignored the PGO-possibility because he though PGO's are non normal, copped GreyICE.<br><br>Now, let's look at some implications:<br>assume 1b. I think it is clear, that doctor-PGO is non-normal, therefore scum would at this point believe that GreyICE isn't a doc. there is then, however, absolutely no reason for them to sacrifice a teammate, since DRK would die anyway. so I think this case is impossible.<br>so, in either of both cases, we have the component &lt;Krazy ignored/didn't believe the PGO-claim&gt; (in the first case because of 1a in the second because of Krazy's, truthful if we assume this case, statement). So this point against Krazy is moot. we still don't have to forget, that it is more unlikely that the rest of the scumteam assumed too, that PGO was out of the question (I'm going to assume that there is a 3-man scumteam, since there is no evidence which suggests otherwise)<br><br>so we are left with:<br>1: Krazy is scum fakeclaiming cop out of the blue (A), GreyICE is a doc(H), who gambitted 1shot-PGO possibility (B), there is a scum RB(Ca) who blocked GreyICE (Cb), both of Krazy's scumpartners didn't believe the PGO-claim (D)<br>vs.<br>2: Krazy is a cop (G) GreyICE is scum fakeclaiming doc after preparing it for a while together with a fake 1shot-PGO possibility-claim (E), Krazy copped GreyICE as if he hadn't seen the PGO-claim (F).<br><br>I think (Cb) looked like an almost a null assumption to me at first glance, but rethinking it it isn't at all:<br>since if the scumteam didn't believe the PGO-claim, then they certainly believed the doc-claim, so (assuming Ca) they had the option between killing and blocking GreyICE. Now, honestly, since DRK hadn't really given any PR-vibes to me (this is subjective of course) I assume, that his kill wasn't a PR-hunt. this turns Cb into &lt;this scumteam prefers to block the doc rather than killing him even if there is no other possible PR around&gt;(Cc)<br>Assuming G, I claim that F is quite likely. First, I noted that quite some people (me included) saw GreyICE as rather townie, while Krazy seemed much more on the null-to-scummy-side. Now, I think that if I were a town cop (assumption G), this would exactly be the kind of person who's alignment I'd like to know. (*)<br>I also think that B and E have a rather similar probability (this I think, is the weakest point in this analysis, I'd love to hear comments about it), because both include a gambit made for similar reasons (town reason: prevent being NK'd; scum reason: prevent being investigated.) Especially considering the position in the town GreyICE had, I think he could almost equally fear NK or investigation (for town or for scum respectively)<br>Now, I think we can drop G,H and Ca from the list of assumptions as those are basically setup-speculation and role distributions.<br>What we are left with, is A+D+Cc vs. F, where F is extremely weak by argument (*). I think even a difference in evaluation between B and E couldn't tip the scale to the other side at this point.<br><br>this is funny, I started typing with the objective to prove that 1 is likelier than 2, but I think that after this analysis it is clear that it is exactly the other way round<br>I think at this point, I am going to vote by statistical likelihood, as I think I can trust that more than my reads off the extremely chaotic last pages.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: GreyICE</span></span><br><br><br>actually, I think I forgot an assumption for 2: &lt;Krazy thought claiming cop with one guilty is a good play&gt;. Now, I think, I would have claimed with a guilty (especially with a guilty on GreyICE, who was a quite pro-town looking player more dangerous than the average scum)<br>So, I think this isn't a heavy assumption. I think it is worth less than Cc. So even canceling those two, we would still be left with A+D vs. F."}

What follows are my thoughts in no real order:<br>The underlined: only scum know's for sure who is and isn't town. Llama makes a point-blank statement \"Krazy was tunneling town.\" The only way we can be sure a person is town is via a flip, unless you're scum where you know the people are town. Llama slipping here a bit?<br>This post pointed out a summation of Krazy's antics, and from a scum standpoint that he'd make an easy mislynch. The \"yay day returned just as I did\" comment felt out of place, but other than a gut feeling that line's nothing by itself. <br>But his comment on krazy attacking llama's town reads. From what I got of Llama's <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2808925#p2808925\" class=\"postlink\">ISO 15</a> his reads are:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Llamarble wrote:</cite>Town:<br>Me<br>DRK<br>GreyICE<br>Neruz<br><br>Unsure:<br>Redacted<br>Nathanael<br>SC (now pappums rat)<br>Hiraki<br>Ant (now me)<br><br>Scummy<br>MME<br>bgg<br>Xine<br>Greedling</div></blockquote><br><br>Llama was right, Krazy does go after most of Llama's town reads, looking back through Krazy's ISO.<br>Something came up that got me thinking initially.. Krazy subbed in for Greedling after Llama posted his reads. I wanted to look back and check out greed's posts, and the whole two of them were useless: a vote for Grey and a vote for Xine... wait, a vote for grey?<br>Something caught my eye:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Krazy from <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2818092#p2818092\" class=\"postlink\">ISO 8</a> wrote:</cite>Well, I was hoping I would feel a lot better about Neruz, Llama, and GreyIce after getting a chance to talk to them a bit.

First, there's no way I'd have the option of picking between PGO and doctor.  That's as non-normal as a role could get, and very hard to balance for (first because PGO is a very weak role, whereas doctor is a very strong one, and it gets weirder from there).  Second, he's overtunneling on Llama who, despite my doubts, should not be focused on higher than Xine (obvscum) and TBM (either really bad scum or really bad town, I can't tell which).  <br><br>Llama does deserve attention though, which is why I say his logic is half complete.  His weird willingness to believe I get some sort of binary role where I can pick PGO or Doctor aside, it's not totally bad.  <br><br>2) Krazy is flailing.  That was a clear misrep of Neruz - Neruz was saying that every post Krazy did made him scummier.  At this point he's claiming a guilty on town, so finding minor scumtells in his posts is like complaining about a smudge of dirt on a pile of shit for me, but I understand that the rest of you don't have the benefit of my Role PM.  Nevertheless, his latest post is a whole lot of bullshit.  He's buddying his ass off without ever explaining the key of this entire thing - how did I softclaim both my role and my targets before he claimed if I'm claiming in response to his guilty?  <br><br>3)  I have a good history with scumslips recently.  They come from from town.  Two instances of people accidentally claiming scum in the thread as town.   In comparison, that's minor.  At worst, consider it a null tell, but it in no way means the remaining scumteam is Mute and Llamarble.  Not that you should consider either cleared, but just assuming that's the last two scum is bad.<br><br>4) Okay, that's a tall order, but I'll do so. <br><br>I stuck out feelers on the PGO <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2793262#p2793262\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2794491#p2794491\" class=\"postlink\">get a positive response</a> from Neruz.  At this point I'm just looking to breadcrumb things for WIFOM on the shot, I was hoping the town would have strong players doing good scumhunting so the WIFOM on the PGO role would be enough to push their shots elsewhere.  I make occasional references to it elsewhere to keep it strong in scum minds.  <br><br>I push the Neruz = town if Xine = scum <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2811046#p2811046\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2817912#p2817912\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>, as well as elsewhere.  That reads list in the first is total garbage, btw, I deliberately put three town reads in the scum column, and kept randomizing thing (it's essentially meaningless if there isn't going to be a mislynch on a 'scum' read, and as long as the scum thought I was playing like shit, I'd be less likely to eat the NK).  <br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2817912#p2817912\" class=\"postlink\">At this point</a> I lose my temper, and decide to stop deliberately ignoring the scum, since NO ONE seems to want to scumhunt.  Krazy should have been pinging the shit out of people's radar screens, and just wasn't.  I switch to DRK push <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2847994#p2847994\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2851483#p2851483\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> when it seems clear Neruz has given up on day 1.  Wasn't hard as DRK had never had a wagon on him, had made a good case on Krazy, and was obvtown.  So a few subtle pushes seemed in order, and then I'd have a fair certainty where it would go.  <br><br>Role claim was to ensure no shenanigans with shooting me.  Which worked about 50% as well as hoped.  <br><br>P.S.  As a point of interest, in Papa Zito's archives you have to go back to 1086 to find a town cop role.  <!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=15732\">viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=15732</a><!-- l --><br><br>Nearly as far back as you have to go to find a PGO.

Before now, I was operating under the hope that the lynch on GreyIce would go smoothly and that I would have doctor's protection tonight.  Now it is clear neither of those things are true, sadly enough the lynch will fail because I mistakenly assumed there would be a doctor in the game, and thus I have lost my credibility.  <br> <br>Nonetheless, it seems prudent now to review my suspects.  Now that I have realized that the charges by Llamarble, mostly, that my cop role-claim seems \"improbable\" and that he was actually right about this, I have had to seriously re-evaluate my list of suspects.  Previous to that, I was assuming that Llamarble was likely one of GreyIce's team-mates, hoping to lynch the cop.  Now I can see that his suspicions of me were well-grounded and that he was more willing to push his skepticism than I expected.  His current willingness to lynch me as quickly as possible does not strike me as the behavior of someone who knows I will flip town.<br> <br>So at the moment, I personally believe that Llamarble is actually very likely to be innocent, which rather rewrites my entire suspect list.<br> <br>That does not mean, however, that of the people on the wagon on me that all are innocent.  <br> <br>Two of the other more vocal proponents of my wagon have been Neruz and Mute.  Both have rightly shown skepticism of my claims.  Neruz I feel rightly helped me understand why announcing my cop role was so unbelievable for when I did it.  However, for some reason, I have difficulty then saying that he, like Llamarble, really strikes me as innocent.  Mute, on the other hand, seems to be overdoing it, saying, \"I DO NOT FUCKING BUY KRAZY'S GODDAMN CLAIM AND I FUGGIN' THINK IT'S A LOAD O' HORSE SHIT LOADED WITH TNT!!\"  Both Neruz and Mute have started using silly metaphors like sinking-ships filled with aliens or horse shit loaded with TNT.  Both seem to have taken for granted their oppositional position to me before I even announced my role.  I doubt both are scum.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">But if I were to point to one over the other, I feel like I would go with Neruz.  He seemed to understand the heart of the problem with me announcing my role fairly quickly, but nevertheless wanted me to just stop talking for a while.</span>  In any case, he also seemed to understand the rules behind GreyIce's PGO claim very well.  Perhaps this simply shows an active understanding of the rules.  But perhaps it also shows he was thinking of GreyIce's claim before now himself. <br> <br>As for the remaining players:<br>Xine<br>-I think made a fair point in at least bringing up the possibility of lynching outside of power-role claims, even if it is a more \"neutral\" position to take.  It isn't neutral at all, actually, considering how likely he was before now to be a top candidate for such a lynch.  I am a little bit more concerned about people who would look at this reasonable suggestion and instantly equate it with guilt, regardless of whether they believed me or GreyIce.<br> <br>Pappums Rat<br>-I'm not really a fan of players that throw around suspicion without building a case around it, and him highlighting Mute's \"bussing\" comment (which I think was benign) without commenting on anything else is problematic.<br> <br>TheButtonmen [Redacted]<br>-The subject of \"a whole post\" by GreyIce, I am trying to understand what Ice wanted to do with him here.  I actually did notice that his post toward me back on D1 had a \"different feel\" than his responses to other players.  I'm not exactly sure what to make of that, and I wasn't sure at the time how to respond (\"Why aren't you poking me more?\")  However, he seemed to be one of the few who noticed that there was something wrong with the wagon on me.  But, similar to my current reading of Neruz who seemed to move too easily to the position of my guilt, I wasn't so sure of how to take this.  <br> <br>Hiraki<br>-I'm personally not a fan of \"gut feelings\" to justify votes, and I'm also not a fan of using those gut feelings to avoid answering the questions that either side is producing.  <br> <br>My Milked Eek<br>-Still waiting on that catch-up post.<br><br>Nathanael<br>-Still hasn't addressed the dialogue between me and GreyIce.</div></blockquote><br><br>llamarble, it is the bolded."}

You seem to agree that whether Krazy is really the cop who targeted a claimed PGO, or whether I'm the doctor who didn't count on non-standard action resolution and gambited, if you lynch scum today the other one eats the night kill.  <br><br>So there is 0% chance of there being any cop reads tomorrow, and 0% chance of having any successful doctor protects tomorrow.  <br><br>But it seems absolute, utmost importance that we lynch me, and not Krazy.  Llamarble's logic is good.  It goes from 8:3 to 5:2 if you mislynch me today.  Krazy is not a bad trade for 3 players, he was wagoned and near death yesterday, little chance he wouldn't die today, and if he's the roleblocker and I'm actually a PGO, well, there goes their chance to stop me (which makes this entire line of logic make sense).  <br><br>And if it's really so unimportant, drop the hammer if Krazy is town, lynch me tomorrow.   But for some reason you don't want that.  <br><br>Lets ignore me breadcrumbing my claim before Krazy's cop claim (which needs me to be near-psychic, and which you have never addressed, nor has Krazy) and focus on my actions.  You think that I was not only such obvscum yesterday that I was targeted by a cop despite a PGO claim, but that I am so very much more scummy than Krazy coming out of yesterday?  <br><br>I keep going back and forth on you man.  If you're scum, this is such a bad play.  Xine is about what I'd expect - waffling, and then eventually \"well, I'll drop the hammer, <span class=\"noboldsig\">but</span> lessee if someone salvages this situation.\"<br><br>Bussing is probably what I'd expect of the other teammate.  I mean whether the town believes it or not, you earn mondo town cred once we both flip.  But your play... if you're town, I'm SERIOUSLY smacking you in the postgame thread.  If you're scum, I'm seriously just incredulous.  <br><br>But lets try and make a determination.  Since you completed the reread of the entire game, whose Krazy's most likely partners, if he's scum?"}

The time for lurker lynches is when you're fishing for reads, can't find clear connections, and have a comfortable margin.  Something like 6 town, 1 scum, where lynching an unreadable lurker is good times.<br><br>He made a very clear distinction between the lurkers/flakers, and scummy behavior.  He is right, btw.

Indeed, about 3 posts after that, TBM (aka Redacted) unvoted, and the entire wagon started to fall apart.  The simple fact of the matter is, at the time, Greedling was an obvious flake, so was not going to last minute switch to Neruz.  That means if Marble voted Neruz, and then Xine got lynched and flipped scum, here's where the scumteam was sitting:<br><br>1) Dead<br>2) An obvious flaker who could be replaced by anyone<br>3) The L-1 vote on the town wagon Day 1 running against the scum wagon.<br><br>In other words, a Xine lynch would have killed the team if Marble was the L-1 on Neruz.<br><br>The next two are worth looking at:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Llamarble wrote:</cite>Isn't the deadline in like 9 hours?<br>If we have until replacements arrive then I'm going back to bgg. He's both the most likely player to be scum and the one who hurts us least if we lynch him and he flips town (particularly accounting for the VT claim). His recent behavior has me way more convinced than I was earlier; it was at least somewhat hard to tell if he was faking or not then. Now he's confirmed for us that he was. Saying he's all \"excited to be actively scumhunting now\" just feels so much more like trying to look town than like actually playing to the town wincondition. His scumhunting so far consists of attacking Neruz for \"being willing to vote someone he knows to be town,\" which obviously isn't the game situation. His voting record is the horrible L-2 quicklynch seeking vote on Xine which he followed up by wifomavalancheing when called out for it. That and voting Neruz, whose wagon looks pretty scummy to me.</div></blockquote><br><br>A pretty clear exit port from the Xine wagon.  <br><br>Day 2 he has a newbie town read on Xine.

Only time I've agreed with it was Hoopla's use of it, and she was a confirmed-town Mason while doing so (conf. town is conf. town, and I know that I am not that).  I use VCAs to draw conclusions, but I'm not going to attempt to bias anyone's with things that are unknown facts.<br><br>I'll highlight people's name in colors, when I want to call them out.

Has to be pretty uncomfortable since I clearly DID target the kill N1, and they have no reason to doubt N2.  Where the town is sitting?  I dunno.  I dun care.

If the town distrusts me, lynch me the day before LyLo.  It's the solution if this was a scum gambit.  I have no idea why I'd run a gambit where I told Krazy to claim cop against me on the hope the town would lynch him - because as a claimed cop in a town with known no doctor, he'd be dead.  And that gambit involved us both claiming town power roles vulnerable to counterclaim (and mine was a dozen times more likely to be counterclaimed than his).  But if you really want to, do it.  I have no desire to live to endgame, i want to get the damn scum team.<br><br>Also, \"I intentionally played like a VI to gather information\" is quite the defense.  Did you manage to gather any information this way?  Or was this very subtle plot way too subtle for us?  Also, what was your plan if you were lynched day 1?  Hope the town used your wagon to determine that people voting people who are acting scummy are probably... what?  Players?  It's like the bgg wagon - even as a counterwagon to a scum wagon it tells us much less than it should because bgg's play was so amazingly bad.<br><br>Oh I don't even care.

There is a chance he bussed Krazy hard since he close to being lynched, but the odds for that are very small since GreyICE was considered to be very townie.

However, there is one post that gives him many townpoints:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Nathanael wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">@mod: assuming that a scum targets a PGO with a kill.

Stop it (TBM too by the way). His post are very, very aggressive and making a lot of statements. This is something scum hardly ever does so that gives him many town points. His stalling on the Krazy lynch is a bit scummy, but eventually he made it clear that he wanted the Krazy lynch.<br><span style=\"color: #BFBF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Neutral/Townie</span></span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mute</span><br>There is our little VI from last Mini. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";-)\" title=\"Wink\"> Nevermind, I played awful that game, I don't want to think about it again. Anyways, I wonder what he has done the past few monts, he has become a lot less VI\u00edsh. Did you take a mafia class or something? Mute too stalled around Krazy and was wishy washy about bgg, both were very scummy. I do however, wonder why a Mute scum alone would hammer on a Llamarble lynch all day 2 long. Also, I am a little biased about him since last game, I thought him to be obv scum when he turned out to be town...<br><span style=\"color: #FFFF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Neutral</span></span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">My Milked Eek</span><br>This paragraph will contain as much information as his posts.<br><span style=\"color: #FF4000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Neutral/Scum</span></span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Llamarble</span><br>Changed his reads in about every post on day 1, scummy. Was going very hard for Krazy and not even thinking about ICE being the scum. However, while he was going on for Krazy, he also wanted to tell us that Krazy's scumpartners are likely to bus the crap out of him. His behaviour is just to scummy to pass. At last, I want every body to take a moment to read this post.

Of course they can't all be scum, so I must admit that I'm currently a little lost on individual reads.<br><br>I think another approach is more useful: team analysis.<br>I think the following make good scumteams at this point:<br>Xine/Llamarble<br>Hiraki/ConS<br>MME/Xine (this is based mostly on the fact that Xine spent a lot of effort to get MME replaced, which could indicate a help-in-survival.)<br><br>the scumteams I cannot see are:<br>LLamarble/ConS (based mostly on LLamarble's attack on pappums)<br>Xine/Hiraki (based mostly on the Hiraki sheep of the first Xine-wagon D3)<br><br><br>I think at this point, what we need most is a flip in order to establish a base-line.<br>I don't think dragging this confusion on is going to help us in the long run.<br><br>therefore:<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">I will hammer Xine in my next post</span> (probably tomorrow).

There is no certainty there even is. Why play with that in mind; how is that town-play?<br><br>Second bolded:<br>-Assumption: there is an investigative role.<br>--Theory: they've had three nights to gather information<br>---Confirmed: there is a role-blocker this game. (Grey flipped doc and claimed to have been RB'd. With that I can accept a RB in the setup.)<br>--Theory: Cop ousts themselves<br>---Idea: Cop has one guilty and two innocents. 1/7 confirmed scum. If I were a cop with those odds I'd want to wait til I gather at least one more innocent to deduce the last scum, or find the last scum. 1/7 scum and 2/7 town isn't much of a safety net to say with any certainty that one of the last 6 players are scum.<br>(Non-math version because, in case my numbers are wrong, I can have it said without them: In the event that a cop does have a guilty on one player, and out of the 9 players another 2 are innocent, then that leaves 6 players to choose from to find the last scum. I don't feel any sane cop (with sane meaning mentally sane not investigative-related) would risk exposing themselves with those odds.)<br><br>-Assumption: there in no investigative role.<br>This leads to the third bolded, the order in which Llama desired people should claim.<br>Llama put himself and hiraki towards the bottom. I don't sit well on Llama thinking he should claim last as I still see him as scum, and that he wishes to claim last and assumes there's an investigative role leads me to expect him to either draw out the cop or set himself up with a cop fakeclaim. By making himself last in his lineup, he's setting himself up for \"Well, if there is no cop then I can claim it safely, and if there is then I can claim VT then.\" Supported by this post of his:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Llamarble wrote:</cite>Actually there are 7 players left, so it's 5 town vs. 2 scum. <br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><br>Massclaim is exciting!<br>Must...Wait...until...end...to...comment.</span></div></blockquote><br>How do I see this? Scum eager to see if a cop claims, so to either get them during the night via RB or NK, or if there is no cop, to claim one at the end.<br>Then notice that he put Hiraki, someone he suspected of being scum, 2nd to last on his list. Why would any town want someone they suspect to be scum to claim near the end? That makes no town-sense. It'd make more sense to put them up-front so as to catch them with a counterclaim.<br><br>Sure he put the line \"or we can do the usual popcorn stuff\" at the end of that post, as a way to cover up his malicious intent.<br><br><br>That is why I am against a mass-claim at this time. There's far too many ways scum can take advantage of this, I feel, if there is a RB and his partner still alive.<br><br>Also, Hiraki, I only vaguely understand Masons. (if my memory is correct and your claim is true then this should be my first game where a mason role is used that I don't discredit.) My understanding of them is a recruiter and recruitees, wherein if someone is the recruiter they select a person to make a mason, and the recruited people gain access to talk to one another. Am I correct in this assumption?"}

Off course, it is possible that this is true, but there is no evidence and scum can as easilly fake this as town can out this.<br>- Doc/Masons is by no means underpowered for town. The only bad thing that can happen to severely hinder the town is when the doc is found very fast. If masons are outed very soon, this setup becomes only better, since 2 conf town who are very difficult to be killed (doc protect) are better than two hidden conf town.<br>- He tries to confirm his claim not only with bad setup speculation, but also with knowledge of a scum RB. He said that a scum RB hardly makes sense with doc + masons. How the hell gives that any confirmation on there being another PR? The RB is very useless in this game, but stops conf town to be unkillable.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Typical scum fake-claim behaviour</span><br>- Regrets, town hardly ever regrets: \"If there's one target I regret it's Conspiracy, since I noticed Hiraki saying Conspiracy was obvtown looked role-information-inspired but was still worried they might both be scum.\"<br>- Confirming himself: \"Also town is underpowered without me, so I'm pretty much confirmed town at this point.\"<br>- Overcautiousness in fake-claim: \"As for whether I know if I've been roleblocked, I asked Exe about it Wednesday and haven't gotten a response back yet. But it shouldn't matter since Conspiracy is basically confirmed town and if I recall correctly we know the RB targeted Grey N2 so my result on buttonmen was definitely legitimate.\"<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Other odd things</span><br>- While he said Hiraki could be the replacement of the scumteam (Xtoxm, Nath scumteam, replacement Hiraki) he actually wanted Hiraki to claim second to last. Also, me and TBM, both unlikely to be scum, were earlier to claim than Mute. Even when we are more likely to fake-claim when we are more in the end of the claim list. (And Llam could bust us.<br>- \"I targeted each of the people I targeted because I was suspicious of them.\"<br>Krazy: No mention of him day 1 (his replacee was neutral)<br>TheButtonMan: 1 time mentioned as scum. However, Mute was far more suspicious in his eyes.<br>CS: Tracks his no. 1 suspect. Not as he did night 2.<br><br>So. I want all of you to vote Llamarble so we can lynch the second scum right now.<br><br>BTW, If you paid enough attention Llam, you know that Mute-Nath scumteam is hardly possible.

I still find Grey infinitely more likely to be town than Krazy regardless. I don't know what motivated the copclaim out of the gate D2 though. Maybe setting up bussing or something.

However Krazy was simply a goon, so at best all he was capable of doing was either sending in the kill action, or doing nothing at all.<br>C: I have issues with using meta as examples. Sure I'm not above using it myself but I don't like falling back to it as anything to buffer an argument/statement, not build one out of it. However it contradicts what you say in that same post about pointless setup speculation in that you're using setup speculation to argue against someone.<br>D: I feel that was directed towards the portion I bolded. I think, looking back, scum planned for that to happen, trading a goon to get rid of a then-confirmed PR. Losing a goon isn't too bad for scum as losing a PR is for town, so sure it's a 1:1 trade of players, but the effects hurt each side differently, and getting rid of a PR is always scum's priority when it comes to eliminating town.<br>E: Neruz was town. <br><br>As for beneath that line? I don't know. Again, something in my head's saying \"THIS IS SOMETHING TO COMMENT ON,\" but when it comes to what exactly to comment on about it I'm drawing blank.. I can't call out your comment on \"unsupported setup speculation,\" as we've already had a mass-claim. Maybe it's something about how that comment interacts with Llama. Like I said I'm drawing a blank as to why but it stands out, so hopefully hindsight will help, or someone else will see something I am not seeing, or point out it's something I shouldn't be seeing.<br><br><br><br>I'll see if there's anything else worth mentioning about either buttons, nath, or MME that might have been overlooked.

If not I'll do that later.<br><br>Con's:<br>\"Is overstating his confirmedness as town\" Based on my experience with MS setups and the provability of my actions I was expecting agreement.<br><br>\"Overcautiousness because I asked a rules question\" I wanted to make sure my TBM result was def. legit.<br><br>\"regrets\" I remember thinking Hiraki might have some sort of knowledge confirming Pappums based on his \"Pappums Obvtown\" refrain. That was actually part of the reason I ended up lynching Xine over Pappums. Then when Xine flipped town I was like \"darn it should have lynched the other guy\" and didn't think about what I had noticed while targeting. I normally am very good about keeping things I've noticed in mind while making decisions. Oh well.<br><br>\"Wanting Hiraki to claim second to last despite thinking he might be scum.\" When Hiraki proposed a massclaim I recalled his \"Pappums obvtown\" stuff and thought he might be a cop intending to drop a few innocent results to avoid riskofdeath, so I put him near the end of my list.<br><br>\"Didn't express much suspicion of targets before targeting them\" I reread without Bgg brainclouding N1 and picked Krazy for scumminess, avoiding Xine since I thought she might get vigged and waste my result. N2 I picked Buttons since he and Nath made efforts to lynch Grey over Krazy and at the time I found Nath townier. N3 I picked Cons because he was my suspicion before Xine and Xine's townflip caused a \"darnit shouldn't have switched\" reaction."}

Say you block someone, and the kill goes through; you can they use that to say \"Well I tracked X and nothing happened.\" This is what happened with Krazy. CS is confirmed mason and town, so your \"tracking\" him is now a moot argument. All that remains is buttons, whom you say you tracked and nothing happened. Nathan you tracked and you were RB'd.<br>Process of elimination?<br>*Buttons and Llama are scum.<br>Even if Llama succeeded in getting Nathan/myself lynched, that's a scum-win right there.<br>Even if Llama succeeded in being today's lynch, that'd cast suspicion on me, heavy suspicion on nathan, and none on buttons... providing Llama doesn't flip RB. If Llama flips RB then we assume him saying \"oh I targeted Nathan to track at night\" is a ploy to get Nathan mislynched D6 pending Llama's D5 lynch.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Llamarble wrote:</cite>I'm not \"orchestrating blind mice along.\"<br>I am pointing out obvious optimal lylo play guidelines that town from my last game failed to follow.</div></blockquote><br><br>\"town your last game\"<br>1) were you town your last game?<br>2) define last game, as I can say that about at least two games I've played that I can consider my \"last game(s)\"<br>3) Apples to Apples.

I hate seeing double negatives.<br>\"Good distancing, but believable.\" Or with context \"... the only thing that makes me hesitant about a nath-mute team; good distancing, but I can believe it.\" So, you believe it, yet doubt it. So, me pointing out two people having the same opinion aka agreeing is somehow distancing? How does that make sense? It doesn't! You can't take a step closer to someone and be getting away from them at the same time.<br>\"Hey mute just said he was buddying up to nath!\"<br>Wrong-- pointing out that nath and I called into question Llama's claim is not buddying. Pointing out that we both think his claim is shit is just that. We only agree on that point, that your claim of tracker is shit. I came to realize your claim made perfect sense for a RB'er to make. <span class=\"noboldsig\">WITH KRAZY FAKE-CLAIMING COP, and there not being a counter claim, SCUM didn't need to worry about there being a cop this game. SCUM CAN SAY WITH ABSOLUTE SAFETY \"well I tracked this guy and nothing happened\" without the risk of there being any cop investigations.</span><br><br>I suck at explaining shit so lemme try to rephrase that so it makes better sense, and see if my flow of logic is sound.<br><br>&gt;D2: Krazy fakeclaims cop.<br>-Grey counters with a doc claim.<br>-NO COUNTER-COP-CLAIMS, = Scum are guaranteed knowledge of there not being a cop this game.<br>-RB'er, seeing this opportunity, can take his scum-role and turn it into a town PR by reverse logic.<br>&gt;D4(or was it day 3? fuck if I remember): Llama [fake]claims tracker<br>-claims Buttons, CS, and Krazy were tracked. Buttons = nothing, CS = nothing, Krazy = scum-flipped by this point.<br>&gt;D5: Claims was blocked.<br>-scum Rb'er is still alive, so entirely believable.<br>--claims Nathan was the intended target.<br>*btw, even if I was the intended track, this point'd still make sense. So really, anytime you see me mention nathan being tracked you can just as easily substitute him for me*<br>-Town, \"convinced\" of the claim of tracker, agrees to lynch the person the tracker could not track.<br>-scum wins the game.<br>THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

The purpose here is to demonstrate clearly the effects of my tracking results on my play:<br><br>D1, I was somewhat suspicious of Krazy's slot and listed it in my scumpile.<br>My first post of D2, I have received \"Krazy targeted DRK\" and am pretty much convinced he's scum. Hence:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Llamarble wrote:</cite>Yay, the day returned just as I did!<br>DRKtown &amp; BGGtown make me think Krazy is indeed scum. DRK was very suspicious of Krazy and then died. Krazy spent all day tunneling town and attacking people I have town reads on without really explaining. He did explain why bgg was scummy, but that was a pretty easy situation for scum to fake a case in. And he was in the middle of the bggwagon, as scum often are.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Krazy wrote:</cite>At the moment I think GreyIce is piss-poor town, but if bgg flips town (and Xine by relation) then GreyIce would be in my top 3 with Llamarble and Hiraki.</div></blockquote><br>This, coupled with tunneling on bgg looks like a plan to lynch the easy townie and follow it up by attacking other players all of whom look town to me. I don't see how a bgg townflip exonerates Xine at all; she was hardly reluctant to lynch him. Greedling didn't do anything except wagon Xine though (a reason I found him suspicious yesterday), so Krazyscum doesn't necessarily imply Xinescum regardless.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Krazy</span></div></blockquote><br><br>And after Krazy claims, proving conclusively he's a liar rather than some town PR who targeted the night-death, I write<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Llamarble wrote:</cite>I don't see how any cop in their right mind would investigate PGOdoc. I find mafia risking a roleblock on a claimed possible PGO weird too. Unless RBing a PGO does not result in death (because of the RB), in which case it would make perfect sense. <span class=\"noboldsig\">I still find Grey infinitely more likely to be town than Krazy regardless.</span> I don't know what motivated the copclaim out of the gate D2 though. Maybe setting up bussing or something. Neruz's last is weird too. Who votes for somebody and then says \"if he flips scum, go ahead and lynch me!\" Anyway,<br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> CONFIRM VOTE: KRAZY </span></div></blockquote><br>I never show even slight doubt Krazy is scum for the duration of the day.<br>Having proved N1 action, on to N2:<br><br>My reads shortly before N2 (Woo my townalliance was all town):<br><blockquote><div><cite>Llamarble wrote:</cite>TOWN ALLIANCE OF DOOM:<br>Llama<br>Grey<br>Neruz<br>Hiraki<br><br>Town:<br>Nathanael<br>Pappums<br><br>Probably town:<br>Xine (some of her stuff just feels forthright to me; I guess I'll go into some detail at some point)<br>MME<br><br>Scumteam:<br>TBM<br>Mute<br>Krazy<br><br>I have a very very good feeling about this.</div></blockquote><br>But then after N2, when I have been informed TBM visited noone:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Llamarble wrote:</cite>Yay, we were right!<br>Though I suppose it may have been impossible to be wrong between TBM/Grey.<br>I've not really been seeing Xinescum, but I'll keep reading her and trying.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">I read TBM again and I can see the misguided town angle for him.</span><br><br>Currently I'm pondering MME &amp; Mute &amp; have to look more at Xine.<br>And I need to check on my Hirakitown read.</div></blockquote><br>I soon disagree with Xine on her scumread of TBM &amp; list TBM as \"Likely Town\" in my next scumlist.<br>This complete readflip on TBM was the result of role information I received.<br><br>And finally N3.<br>Before (I also had put conspiracy scummiest on some previous lists, but here's a clear demonstration right before night):<br><blockquote><div><cite>Llamarble wrote:</cite>It's a logical analysis of actions vs. what looks like town thinking situation, so I've had problems making up my mind.<br>My best guess for a non Xine team is Conspiracy / MME or Conspiracy / Hiraki.</div></blockquote><br>After:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Llamarble wrote:</cite>I'D LIKE TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: XTOXM</span><br><br>SCUMBUDDY: NATHANAEL<br><br>Though Hiraki could replace one of them.</div></blockquote><br>Poof!<br>Scumread on Conspiracy has vanished in favor of the other players who are now twice as likely due to my \"did not visit\" result.<br><br>Clearly, my reads reflect my results.<br>If you want to believe I'm scum, you have to believe I've been preparing this fakeclaim the entire game and utterly trashed my buddy D2.<br>Scum just don't do things like preparing a tracker claim the whole game through because there are all sorts of ways the setup can wreck that plan.<br>And scum don't just obliterate their buddies for no reason while minimizing towncred gained by telling them to fakeclaim.<br><br>Mute has continually failed to address the fact that these two aspects of my behavior fundamentally do not make sense from scum."}

I HoS'd BGG because I knew he was a horrible lynch. I siad it outright that lynching him D1 was an asinine move for town. Yet, you were one of his more avid pushers, despite him being an obvious VI. I HoS'd him because on the off-chance he was scum playing a VI he was still a horrible D1 lynch. D2 would have been better as by that time we'd have a kill to go with and him being alive would be a liability to everyone. Wanting to get rid of someone only after finding a more appropriate target isn't scummy, it's a null tell. Trying to twist it to make it seem scummy, is itself scummy.<br>2) Neruz also realized that I unvoted to attack my next target, and he called TBM scummy too. Buttons is still alive, so this implicates him as much as me. Argument is moot in a case against me if it implicates more than me I feel.<br>But that's not all! <span class=\"noboldsig\">KRAZY FLIPPED SCUM</span>.<br>3) Oh but I'd love to hear. I've already gotten a buzz from your post so far, why not just get shit-faced?<br>4) Hiraki was a wild card. His vote could change like the winds. He was as much a liability to town as he was to scum, as, in no offense intended hiraki, but you were too easy to sway. Using the \"I'm a mason\" to justify his play of wanting to just place hammer votes because he was a mason, what was there to worry about? <br>Also, you mentioned CS and him thinking you're scummy too... why mention this if you're using Hiraki's death to implicate me?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Llamarble wrote:</cite>Everyone who dies likes the idea of lynching Mute.

Layman's terms here is what I'm looking for.<br><br>Setup theories:<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">x VT's, 2 masons, 3 scum (1 RB, 1 goon, 1 unknown), 1 doctor.<br></span>or<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">x VT's, 2 masons, 3 scum (1 RB, 1 goon, 1 unknown), 1 doctor, 1 tracker.<br></span><br>Your argument for your claim is that town would be underpowered without a tracker.<br>My question is this: <span class=\"noboldsig\">why would town be underpowered if there were not a tracker, and by extension, if town is underpowered, how is scum overpowered if there is not a tracker or similar investigative role?</span><br>My two cents on this have already been said, but I'll sum up my reason your claim is a lie and you're scum for it. No, this won't be about how you're the RB, I already explained that.<br><br>Let's take the first instance as the setup. the RB and doc negate one another, leaving the rest as vanilla roles. The masons cannot recruit townies, and they basically serve to confirm to two players each other is town. So, RB is useless against them, as well as the other VT's. This I find to be balanced. Town can be hindered by scum, and town can defend itself with it's PR. an even 1:1 PR exchange.<br><br>With your example, the second setup theory, this is not the case at all.<br>The tracker only serves as a demi-cop, unable to detect alignment but instead if X acts during the night. A RB can negate the tracker, but that leaves the doctor to protect against the NK. A 2:1 exchange of PR's. Now, you say that without you, a claimed tracker, the town is underpowered, but from where I'm sitting, with your role-claim of tracker, town is either balanced with or over-powered to scum. For the town to be underpowered without you, there must be a scum role that can evade a tracker, or is immune from being tracked or bypassing doctor protections.<br>This worries me. If that is the case, say we have a setup of:<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">x VT's, 2 masons, 1 Doc, 1 tracker, 1 scumRB, 1 scum goon, 1 scum GF<br></span>then even then the GF would serve as a superfluous role. I can rule this out as thanks to the mass claim earlier and the lack of a counter claim to krazy, there is no cop in the setup and therefore no need for a scum-role that returns town when investigated.<br>So, the setup that comes to mind:<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">x VT's, 2 masons, 1 doc, 1 tracker, 1 scumRB, 1  goon, 1 hitman/assassin<br></span>this is a 2:2 exchange of PR's. Sure it's not balanced, as the doctor can be RB'd as well as ignored by the hitman, but the tracker serves as a counter to the hitman. This setup I cannot believe either, as it underpowers the doc.<br>Take the tracker out of the setup:<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">x VT's, 2 masons, 1 doc, 1 scumRB, 1 goon, 1 hitman/assassin<br></span>With this, you are correct, town is severely underpowered. The doctor can be RB'd and ignored, and there's nothing town can do about it. This is the error I see with your claim, aside from the earlier reasons. Unless you know for sure what the setup of the scumteam is, it's folly to claim town is underpowered without you. Let's see what happens without a tracker/similar role, and with 2 goons and a RB.<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">x VT's, 2 masons, 1 doc, 1 scumRB, 2 goons</span><br>a 1:1 exchange of PR's.<br><br>My point: Llama must have knowledge of the scumteam setup for him to claim that without a town investigative role, town is underpowered and scum is overpowered; the only way for this to be true, him having knowledge of the scum setup, is if he himself is scum.<br><br>Now, back to my question:<br>Llama: <span class=\"noboldsig\">why would town be underpowered if there were not a tracker, and by extension, if town is underpowered, how is scum overpowered if there is not a tracker or similar investigative role?</span>"}

Not necessarily the most impressive play I've seen from a scum team, but you did what you needed to and got into a position in which you could take advantage of town's less-than-ideal play.  No use arguing with results.<br><br>Town play this game was....interesting.  I'm going to gloss over that almost entirely and just comment on two things.<br>1) Do not speculate on the setup unless you understand setup design and balance.  Those of us in the dead QT really wanted to stab some of you when you started saying Llama's role didn't fit in...<br>2) I kind of felt bad for Llamarble.  He really did play that lylo almost perfectly, but there was nothing he could do once Mute voted him.<br><br><br>The setup itself was nice.  Masons seem to be getting a lot more popular because of the recent wave of hatred for cops.  I think there's an interesting argument to be made from it though that actions in normal games should either be standardized or stated beforehand by the mod.  When GreyICE made his claim of being either PGO or doctor, he would never have guessed that a roleblocker could block a PGO, since passive actions usually can't be blocked.  From what the mod said, that didn't actually play into the scum's decision to block him, but, well, it really should have and it could have been a big deal.  Also of note, if I'd had the tracker role, I wouldn't have thought to ask the mod whether or not the roleblocker was allowed to kill and block because it's so rare outside of newbie games.  The scum team didn't even realize it until night 2 and that got one of their goons tracked to a kill (he was likely going down anyway, but it didn't help...).  It's not that there was anything inherently wrong with the action resolution Exe was using...it's just unexpected in a normal game.  Anyone here have thoughts on that?  (I'll probably turn it into an MD thread later.)"}
