I didn't see Jake's vote as RVS, though it was his first vote of the game, so I suppose it could be said. However, he still gave no reason, even an RVS reason, so I don't find her response out of the ordinary. What I find out of the ordinary is how quickly she jumped on truly, who simply seems uber newbie to me, and I was pretty nervous my first few games as well. I don't think it's indicative of his alignment, either way, and certainly not enough to warrant a vote from Rach.

I'm a little unnerved because you have mentioned past games as evidence as relevant in these circumstances, regarding explanation for why truly14's behavior should not be so quickly overlooked. Truth is, I'm not familiar with Newbie 1225. Never heard of ETL either. I just think there are players of varying experience/styles, regardless of their join date, and I don't see how ETL's brilliant second game is not an exception or how Newbie 1225 applies here. I rambled a lot but I tried to help you understand. I got the feeling you were intent on pressuring truly14 early and what gets me is how many other players were there and why you picked the newest player to pick on.

That&#8217;s a real plus. Looking back at the last few pages, that&#8217;s something I really really liked. It&#8217;s just you were so suspicious about everyone on your wagon.

Anyway, umm after b-fast I'm going to finish regurgitating the first part of that post that I lost. <br>\n<br>\nMy basic point (withot looking back) is that I like how you put the pedal on the metal but then you withdrew it so that Truly had some time to explain ehrself and then we can gauge all the reactions going on. You pressured Truly but not to the point where she felt A lynch was inevitable/imminent. It just seems like RIGHT NOW not scummy to me. I changed my mind because honestly it's not a big deal what you did right now. <br>\n<br>\nInitially, I felt that it was \"fishy (using ur words out of your mouth now sorry)\" but right now it seems unusual but I'll get used to it. The only reaction test I'd seen before was a lot of drunk posting so this is different. IT was subtle, and at first I Felt like you were just saying it was a reaction test for the hell of it so people would drop it about you bandwagoning truly. But now I get you.

MS [or his soon to be replacement?] comes in and says, \"Nacho is not my neighbor.\" Here's what goes down:<br>\n- We lynch Nacho.  Nacho flips scum.  Let's keep rolling.<br>\n- We lynch Nacho.  Nacho flips neighbor.  MS's slot is scum.  We lynch MS tomorrow.  Let's keep rolling.<br>\n- Least likely scenario?  We lynch Nacho.  Nacho flips VT or some stupid thing.  We are out a Town liability.  We shrug and soldier on without that kind of play holding us back.<br>\n<br>\nIf MS [or his soon to be replacement] says, \"Nacho is my neighbor?\"  That makes a big difference and it's on to plan B.  While the MS slot can't guarantee the alignment of Nacho [or themselves], it CAN provide information that there is no reason for us not to know and can give us a better understanding of the mechanics at play in this game.  In this case, more information is better for the Town than for scum.[/quote]<br>\nThere is no scum motivation to lie as neighbour with a townie or a scumbuddy.

Nacho clearly misunderstood what was going on and didn't realize the other claims were fake/gambits/what-have-you. That being the case, I feel safe in assuming he's town. I believe Yates is also town, and by extension, MS, because 1) based on preceding evidence, I believe Rach is scum and 2) I don't think we'd have only one set of neighbors with scum in it, much less one (or more) scum NOT in a set of neighbors if one of the neighbors is indeed scum. In addition to this, it's unlikely there are 2 sets of neighbors AND a set of masons.

The last thing I did was \"copy\" your claim.  The <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">obvious</div> reason I was so persistent in making you verify Nacho's claim is because I already knew I was neighbors with ETL and thought that was too many neighbors.  I still believe one of the neighbors is scum because that's what happens when you have four neighbors.  Since I know my alignment and claiming neighbors <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">after</div> you claimed neighbors is exactly the <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">opposite</div> of a scum move, I think the rest of this Town can be pretty safe in their knowledge of Yates-Town.

If you are actually Town Millers there is a good chance scum won't kill you for wifom reasons.  The second they kill one of you and confirm the existence of the Miller roles they would have to kill the other the next day because now we have essentially an innocent child.  Scum can't leave an innocent child out there to screw up LYLO plans.  Frankly, from a Town perspective, in this scenario you two would protect any investigative roles for two nights in a row which would have us on Day 3 with a live investigator and either two innocent results or an innocent and a guilty.

Also, let's say the \"worst case scenario\" is that the cop investigates a mason and gets an innocent read N1 and the masons are left alive for day 2 wifomy reasons.  Even if the cop panics because a mason is about to be lynched, a claim at that point leaves THREE confirmed Town for the scum to deal with.  So if they kill the cop on N2 guess what?  They just confirmed the cop's result and thus now have to spend the next two nights in a row killing the masons.  Bonus: we could have a Town protective role that covers the cop N2 so when we wake up day 3 there is no kill AND three confirmed Town.  That's pretty much the best position Town could ever hope for.", "time": "Mon Jul 01, 2013 2:03 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29423&start=775", "forum": "53", "thread": "29423"}

I'm not a huge fan of forcing more claims. Not only will we have to get close to hammer, than wait for a claim, but have to deal with whatever truth/lie that person says. If we lynch one of the 6, (I guess 4, as no one besides ETL [and a little bit me, but more likely much later] wants the mason claim lynched, then at least we know what we are dealing with and they have only what they've said to work with.

That&#8217;s a real plus. Looking back at the last few pages, that&#8217;s something I really really liked. It&#8217;s just you were so suspicious about everyone on your wagon. Maybe it&#8217;s a natural reaction that I should exopect, but I felt you were too aggressive. I can&#8217;t complain, because I don&#8217;t see anything wrong with the aggression.

Anyway, umm after b-fast I'm going to finish regurgitating the first part of that post that I lost. <br>\n<br>\nMy basic point (withot looking back) is that I like how you put the pedal on the metal but then you withdrew it so that Truly had some time to explain ehrself and then we can gauge all the reactions going on. You pressured Truly but not to the point where she felt A lynch was inevitable/imminent. It just seems like RIGHT NOW not scummy to me. I changed my mind because honestly it's not a big deal what you did right now. <br>\n<br>\nInitially, I felt that it was \"fishy (using ur words out of your mouth now sorry)\" but right now it seems unusual but I'll get used to it. The only reaction test I'd seen before was a lot of drunk posting so this is different. IT was subtle, and at first I Felt like you were just saying it was a reaction test for the hell of it so people would drop it about you bandwagoning truly. But now I get you.

It's more like frustration boiling.<br>\n<br>\nAnd it's not overdefensive to the point where it's like:<br>\n<br>\nFUCK YOU. DIDNT YUOU SEE THAT WAS TOWN.

It really seems like it was game blocked, not Yates blocked. He does not seem like the kind of person to pass up on secret talk.<br>\n<br>\nSo I was recording a bit on the Yates/ETL thing, but it became a little pointless since ETL put up a massive hissy fit and quit. That seems extra childish, and I give props to whoever (yates?) posted the baby face. That being said I kind of agree with the quitter in certain respects. (and I slightly feel that if ETL were scum, he would not have put up such a tantrum and then quit. I feel like scum might have a little more dignity than that. Maybe.<br>\n<br>\nI had a very sick feeling when MS turned up town that Yates was a manipulating mastermind, as Nacho has been freaking out about since page 6. and someone before gave a vote of confidence that this is not yate's scum game, but really I have enough faith in his abilities that he could pull whatever he wanted over on whoever he wanted. I felt a little fooled and taken in. My day 1 reads of yates were mostly town, and so much so that I was too willing to follow him. I feel a little betrayed, and hence the thought that you, yates are scum.<br>\n<br>\nAnd in response to the votes on me, well the rach/shos combo is obvi.

I can make the conclusion that he was following the game <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">casually.  </div><br>\n<br>\nTherefore, he likely kept up or skimmed enough to get by with a superficial knowledge of what all was going on.

My reasoning about his sudden - but welcome - posts coming in:<br>\n<br>\n1) He did not automatically see Ree's gambit as what it was.<br>\n2) He was not familiar with the neighbor theory being proposed by Yates, which has been - to put it mildly - an in-depth discussion.<br>\n3) He only says \"why not\" after stating his Mac and Ree townreads. This suggests that, he has not been thinking deeply enough to be more articulate in his initial reads. I can make the conclusion that he was following the game <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">casually.  </div><br>\n<br>\nTherefore, he likely kept up or skimmed enough to get by with a superficial knowledge of what all was going on.

It really seems like it was game blocked, not Yates blocked. He does not seem like the kind of person to pass up on secret talk.<br>\n<br>\nSo I was recording a bit on the Yates/ETL thing, but it became a little pointless since ETL put up a massive hissy fit and quit. That seems extra childish, and I give props to whoever (yates?) posted the baby face. That being said I kind of agree with the quitter in certain respects. (and I slightly feel that if ETL were scum, he would not have put up such a tantrum and then quit. I feel like scum might have a little more dignity than that. Maybe.<br>\n<br>\nI had a very sick feeling when MS turned up town that Yates was a manipulating mastermind, as Nacho has been freaking out about since page 6. and someone before gave a vote of confidence that this is not yate's scum game, but really I have enough faith in his abilities that he could pull whatever he wanted over on whoever he wanted. I felt a little fooled and taken in. My day 1 reads of yates were mostly town, and so much so that I was too willing to follow him. I feel a little betrayed, and hence the thought that you, yates are scum.<br>\n<br>\nAnd in response to the votes on me, well the rach/shos combo is obvi. You talked it over in the night and wanted me for whatever reason (probs because I wanted you dead...) I thought it over a bit, and am willing to give it yet another day. (I actually think that my WIFOM of if you don't die, i will want to lynch you, kept you from being killed) so in other words, I am totally going to want to lynch you tomorrow if one of you doesn't die tonight! (but I am kinda serious about it too...)<br>\n<br>\nAnd as for the scummyness, I clearly don't think my patterns have been very scummy, but thats me thinking about me, and understanding and empathizing with every word I say, haha. I'll be taking questions, as always, to prove my innocence as best I can.<br>\n<br>\nWhat else? ah yes, I have some poor feeling towards Mac too, and the 'sure it was scum' triggered me too as something very off.

WTF, is there a good side of town and a bad side of town? Then, you are going to investigate infinity tonight, while he gets NKed... that seems like a good use of time... he'll be dead if the scum take the bait. and your result won't matter at all. way to waste an investigation (and one that is potentially protected). Lets take it sentence by sentence, because there is so much wrong here.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>If I'm alive tomorrow and there is a no kill? Infinity just proved he's a doc.</div></blockquote>\nmaybe. why the hell would the mafia target you when a claimed doc would say he is going to protect you? and why couldn't you, as scum, choose to put in a no kill to trick the faked save. I dunno why this helps at all.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>If I'm dead tomorrow? Infinity is scum.</div></blockquote>\nsure, whatever. If i were infinity, I would say I would save you and target someone else to try and stem off the real night kill. This option seems super unlikely to me anyways<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>If Infinity and I are BOTH dead tomorrow? This game is crazy and just lynch Mr_Ree then the Masons.</div></blockquote>\nthis one i like.<br>\n<br>\nso lets say your plan goes off without a hitch (for you) and you survive the night, and infinity dies a terrible death. You claim to have investigated him, and he is dead, so your result is obviously correct. That does not prove you are a cop in the least. It proves you can state the obvious. and its not like we'l get anything useful out of that because with the doc dead, the cop will die the next night (if you even are one!) Which I have doubted since you faked claimed it long ago (with the other 10 fake claims you have had)<br>\n<br>\nIn short, Yates I think you are lying, you are bending logic to make it seem like you will be 'proven' town, and I don't trust you.<br>\n<br>\nSo, with that kind of assumption, there would normally be a vote to follow. But you've set up such a situation that it feels like the mason deal all over again and that it would be foolish to lynch you today, so again, we wait. Or rather, I wait.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">In other news</div> I believe infinity's ousted claim, and I am not really sure why, but I already thought you were town, so there a goes.<br>\n#2 I am slightly feeling like mac is townish, and have a much less desire to lynch him.<br>\n#3 I refuse to do anything Yates thinks is a good idea, and he wants DP dead atm.<br>\n#4 I am starting to feel that fuzzy is scum and will have my vote.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Fuzzybutterwhatever</span><br>\n<br>\nFirst, you haven't really submitted anything worthwhile. second your two top scum are my two top town reads (infinity and Nacho) and third, because this post just seems to be all about yates (yes, the world DOES revolve around you yates...), fuzzy's iso contains soooooo many posts about how yates is town, I would have guessed that fuzzy is the doc and he is just putting in the good word for when he dies.

I'll give you that there is probably one in the neighbors, and one outside, but you cannot assume to know where the (potential) last one is.

MIGHT. Though I'd bet we've got a pretty good chance to get a scum in yates/ree. <br>\n<br>\nAnd one of Ree's defenses that gave me pause was that he also hid Yates when he pulled him into private QT. Why would scum have that ability? Well to take him away from HIS neighbor. And if this is another Yates master plan that leads us to a mis-lynch, its really time to lynch Yates. He has lied more than any other player (proven), so its time to die.<br>\n<br>\nAnd I'd almost be up for lynching yates first, but his claim is much stronger that Ree is scum than vice versa, and has more potential damage.

Because I WAS TALKING TO HIM IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD.  So why wouldn't THAT be my kill??<br>\n<br>\nOR - I could have taken a shot at Nacho, who is getting the dumb-Town pass.  Why not kill there?<br>\n<br>\nConversely, you already interrogated me.  So I already KNOW that you are an interrogator.  In which case, if I were scum and you were Town I would already know I couldn't NK you.  So I wouldn't target YOU either.<br>\n<br>\nIf I were scum and wanted the \"Masons\" dead, I would wait until one was lynched and just NK the other if they were actually masons.  Otherwise, I'd be left with a dead mason which confirms the live mason and removes a potential lynch candidate.  So again, I would have no reason to NK the masons.<br>\n<br>\nBottom line: your \"logic\" is wrong.  There is no scenario that ends in me trying to kill you or RM last night and there is EVERY scenario to indicate I would have killed Aces or Nacho or just gone rogue on Broom or Stubbs.", "time": "Fri Jul 26, 2013 12:41 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29423&start=1800", "forum": "53", "thread": "29423"}

If there really are Masons + Ree's claimed role in the setup, which if there aren't any other PRs then that's the only thing that makes sense, then that's three clears that scum have a really hard time getting rid of. In that case, trying to lynch the unnightkillables as much as Yates has would just be way too obvious of a move, and if the scum was thinking at all they would realize that it wasn't going to work.<br>\n<br>\nDue to the how strong the claimed PR's are together, I'd think that to counter that the scum would need three members, and the best way around that would be to leave them alive, since going after them would only cause themselves harm, and kill everyone else so they can endgame the PR's.<br>\n<br>\nI doubt that the scum would try to kill Ree, since there would be a really good chance that they would just end up wasting their kill. They could have specifically no-killed, but that would mean that they had something to gain from faking a protect that was worth more than someone dying. That would pretty much mean that either Ree or the Masons are actually scum. I still see no way that Ree is scum in this setup, and even though I'm less sure about the Masons, I'm leaning town on them as well. The only other option is that they tried to kill Rach. Why not Shos? Because he was the more obvious protect, so in order to kill a Mason, the scum probably tried to target the one who was less likely to be protected.", "time": "Sat Jul 27, 2013 1:00 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29423&start=1825", "forum": "53", "thread": "29423"}

The first is forced at this point if Fuzzy is town. If Fuzzy is actually scum, then the only real investigative results we have are WIFOM from Fuzzy. Fuzzy isn't going to claim a guilty on both of his partners because that seems like it would be far too risky given the fact that we are in LyLo and they haven't lost a member yet. There is also the chance that both Broom and Telo are town, because scumfuzzy might hope that at least one of them would go over well, forcing Nacho and Pepper to be the two remaining scum. If scumfuzzy claimed guilty on one partner and guilty on one townie, then I think it's Broom over Telo since I've never changed my mind about the scumread I had on him earlier.

I think you guys underestimate the power of masons. They're two confirmed townies right off the bat. A cop first needs to get his investigations in, and survive for long enough to claim them. When balancing, I count a pair of masons as about the equivalent of a 2/3-shot cop. The fact that all three scum still managed to avoid getting lynched is a testament to their good play.<br>\n<br>\nThe core setup was more or less 2 Masons &amp; Doc vs. 3 Goons, which is at worst a little bit scum-sided (see for example the approved 13p open Friends and Enemies, with 3 masons vs. 3 goons - this is slightly scum-sided, but exchanging a goon for a doc and making it closed should more or less cancel that out).<br>\n<br>\nThe factor that I was hoping would help tilt the game towards town was the three separate neighbourhoods that existed every night. Town neighbours might not be particularly strong PR's, but the idea is of course that by discussing the game at night, Town Neighbours might be able to figure out the alignment of their neighbour. Unfortunately, much of this was negated by the early lynch of neighbours, and the fact that Ree exclusively targeted neighbours and Masons (of course through no fault of his own - I had fully intended that he use it to protect masons once they claimed. Had I bothered with more flavour this game, I would have likely gone for some sort of witness-protection description). Since there were 2 neighbourhoods and a masonry, I thought it likely you would decide that there's 1 scum among the neighbours, which splits the town into two, with 1/4 scum in the neighbours, and 2/9 scum in the rest.<br>\n<br>\nAs it happened, a lot in this game went badly for town, so the result may have been a bit scumsided, but I don't think there's much I would change about the setup. I considered adding a 5th VT to bring it up to 14 players, but that's no longer a mini.<br>\n<br>\nOne thing I didn't anticipate which I'm afraid adversely affected the game was the naming of the interrogator role. I didn't realise Interrogator is exclusively the name for a slightly altered scum version of Ree's role on EM, so I apologise for any confusion caused by that.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Modding</div><br>\n<br>\nFor the most part, I was able to stay on top of vote counts, deadlines, QT's and night actions. Thank you to ETL and others for stepping up with (unofficial) votecounts when I was away. One thing I take responsibility for is having to find another replacement for Infinity's slot. When he replaced in, he was the only offer I had, although he warned me he would have to replace back out. I was afraid I might not get back for at least another day, so I decided to replace him in the for the time being.<br>\n<br>\nIf I'm going to run another game with many QT's I should make the rule about QT-quoting more explicit. As it was, I think I'm happy with the decision of leaving Yates' slot intact, given that his QT quoting didn't give a game-altering advantage over just paraphrasing it.<br>\n<br>\nAnother thing I should have anticipated was how to explain Ree's role. Given that this was a normal game, I felt I should answer all questions about his role, but quoting his role PM upon request by shos was perhaps not the best way I could have handled it. From now on, in games with full flips I will post role PM's with all flips, and I'll withhold all role-information except role name and alignment in themed games.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Play</div><br>\n<br>\nNight Actions<br>\n<br>\nNight 1:<br>\nRee interrogates Yates (success)<br>\nfuzzy kills stubbs (success)<br>\n<br>\nNight 2:<br>\nRee interrogates Rach (success)<br>\nNachopappa kills Rach (failure)<br>\n<br>\nNight 3:<br>\nRee interrogates shos (success)<br>\nDoctorPepper kills Rach (success)<br>\n<br>\nNight 4:<br>\nRee interrogates shos (success)<br>\nfuzzy kills shos (failure)<br>\n<br>\nNight 5:<br>\nRee interrogates shos (success)<br>\nNachopappa kills Ree (success)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAs much as there were things here and there that made the game more difficult for town than it perhaps should have been, that shouldn't detract from the praise that Bert, DP, and fuzzy deserve for a flawless win. There were times when I was sure DP and fuzzy would have been lynched, but somehow they avoided it.<br>\n<br>\nOn the town side, Ree's gambit and claim were definitely a high point. Yates' counter-gambit was well-reasoned, and would have certainly been good play by him had I followed EM naming convention. As it was, his lynch was rather unfortunate and undeserved. A few of you had pretty good reads early on. I think stubbs basically nailed the scumteam D1, but he was of course killed N1. KA showed a good line of thought upon replacing in, and shos and Ree somewhat managed to keep the town together towards the end. Town wasn't falling to pieces as it often does after a few mislynches, scum just played well enough to avoid getting scumread.<br>\n<br>\nCongrats again to Bert, DP, and fuzzy!", "time": "Sun Aug 18, 2013 11:51 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29423&start=2300", "forum": "53", "thread": "29423"}

That is unless Nacho did a me and turned his neighborhood QT into a personal one.<br>\n<br>\nMy theories on balance is mostly coming from the fact that my only other closed normal was 10:2, with a doctor and nurse against a one-shot tracker and day-talk enabler. Despite there only being two scum instead of three, the mod actually said he thought it was scumsided postgame. I don't know if I said this yet, but one of the main reasons I referred to JK9 was because PR's in an open game pretty much double as IC's, so it's still two initial clears+investigative role. And personally I think that closed setups are always a fair amount more scumsided than open ones due to the amount of paranoia they create. Looking at Friends and Enemies, I think that the third mason would actually be more powerful than the doctor because it's losing a free clear for a chance of giving the town one more mislynch if and only if the doctor makes two successful protects over the course of the game, which the chances of are minimal. The only reason it made as much of a splash as it did here was because of Ree's bulletproof claim. That plus the fact that it was closed makes me think that it was more scumsided than anything. I should have realized though that a cop would push it way too far over the line of being townsided though.<br>\n<br>\nThen again, I'm just the noob here who's only played two of these before, so I probably shouldn't talk about balancing at all. That's why I decided to mod an open instead of a closed, because as much as I scrutinize, I could never do it myself. (I'm third in the queue right now by the way, if you're interested in joining.)<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, good games all around, and sorry I ended up causing more harm than good.", "time": "Sun Aug 18, 2013 5:53 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29423&start=2300", "forum": "53", "thread": "29423"}
