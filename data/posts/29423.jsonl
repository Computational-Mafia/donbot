I didn't see Jake's vote as RVS, though it was his first vote of the game, so I suppose it could be said. However, he still gave no reason, even an RVS reason, so I don't find her response out of the ordinary. What I find out of the ordinary is how quickly she jumped on truly, who simply seems uber newbie to me, and I was pretty nervous my first few games as well. I don't think it's indicative of his alignment, either way, and certainly not enough to warrant a vote from Rach. She's definitely at the top of my list and will likely get my vote unless someone else makes me think otherwise."}

I'm a little unnerved because you have mentioned past games as evidence as relevant in these circumstances, regarding explanation for why truly14's behavior should not be so quickly overlooked. Truth is, I'm not familiar with Newbie 1225. Never heard of ETL either. I just think there are players of varying experience/styles, regardless of their join date, and I don't see how ETL's brilliant second game is not an exception or how Newbie 1225 applies here. I rambled a lot but I tried to help you understand. I got the feeling you were intent on pressuring truly14 early and what gets me is how many other players were there and why you picked the newest player to pick on.

It reminded me in my first game onsite, with her, Rach and serra [url=http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4786199&amp;user_select[]=20880#p4786199]Mafia on the Shore[/url] where one player commented that she made unnecessary mean pissy comments, unlike her first game as town. So there, thats why I say its kinda like her meta if she acts all pissed off. <br><br>Maybe you dont lose your shit if youre scum, maybe youre trying to make it look like your twon by losing your shit and saying you dont do this as scum. I dont know. I do know that *if* you were town and you only like playing scum games, youre pretty much going to get lynched everytime you dont act all angry."}

But ETL was right when he mentioned it can be null. I say newbtown but ehhh\u2026there will be arguments that she/he can play dumb or that he/she was bewildered scum\u2026and those are valid arguments so I can\u2019t really defend her but my instinct is to say she/he is supertown, regardless of that lynch -1 vote which seemed to be to place pressure on Rach and off him/herself.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">ETL</span>: OK this is weird but I haven\u2019t gotten the vibe that ETL is defensive at all? I like his perspective in #232, especially when people have been quick to \u201cgang\u201d up on Truly. Honestly I don\u2019t find you aggressive. I like you, you remind me of someone I like \u2013 Wisdom\u2026except you\u2019re less aggressive/defensive IMO. Maybe it\u2019s because he/she is thinking stuff and putting forth those into posts that I like ETL a lot so far. But I like his answers so far. Blah. Town to me for sure, no doubt about it.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Rach</span>: #149 was like you were appeasing truly but honestly that doesn\u2019t mean a thing and it\u2019s not valid to say, but what I do like is how you were quickly willing to let go of pressuring truly and let him/her have a chance to speak. That\u2019s a real plus. Looking back at the last few pages, that\u2019s something I really really liked. It\u2019s just you were so suspicious about everyone on your wagon. Maybe it\u2019s a natural reaction that I should exopect, but I felt you were too aggressive. I can\u2019t complain, because I don\u2019t see anything wrong with the aggression. Lol if anyone\u2019s reading this you sure have a high tolerance for my typing. Anyway, I\u2019m coming around with the reaction test, so I like hyou right now. Feel free to call my stuff fishy. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Doctor Pepper</span>: I like his comment in #182 (last paragraph) about his perspective on scum perhaps trying reaction tests. That gave me a town vibe. Other than that I don\u2019t have anything to say about this person?? He/she should post more. I do remember I got this person confused with notscience but that\u2019s all I recall.<br><br>P.S. And the part about ETL referring to 232...that post was lost anyway, so some of this stuff may be moot. IT's funny it was the first time this game I had tried to put an effort to re-read several times and form an opinion about anything hahahahaha and CRASH BOOM what................."}

MS [or his soon to be replacement?] comes in and says, \"Nacho is not my neighbor.\" Here's what goes down:<br>- We lynch Nacho.  Nacho flips scum.  Let's keep rolling.<br>- We lynch Nacho.  Nacho flips neighbor.  MS's slot is scum.  We lynch MS tomorrow.  Let's keep rolling.<br>- Least likely scenario?  We lynch Nacho.  Nacho flips VT or some stupid thing.  We are out a Town liability.  We shrug and soldier on without that kind of play holding us back.<br><br>If MS [or his soon to be replacement] says, \"Nacho is my neighbor?\"  That makes a big difference and it's on to plan B.  While the MS slot can't guarantee the alignment of Nacho [or themselves], it CAN provide information that there is no reason for us not to know and can give us a better understanding of the mechanics at play in this game.  In this case, more information is better for the Town than for scum."}

We shrug and soldier on without that kind of play holding us back.<br><br>If MS [or his soon to be replacement] says, \"Nacho is my neighbor?\"  That makes a big difference and it's on to plan B.  While the MS slot can't guarantee the alignment of Nacho [or themselves], it CAN provide information that there is no reason for us not to know and can give us a better understanding of the mechanics at play in this game.  In this case, more information is better for the Town than for scum.</div></blockquote><br>There is no scum motivation to lie as neighbour with a townie or a scumbuddy.

I believed Nacho's claim based on my own role, and knowing that if I wasn't a neighbor, I certainly wouldn't have claimed it as a gambit (I'd choose something else that may not need proving). Nacho clearly misunderstood what was going on and didn't realize the other claims were fake/gambits/what-have-you. That being the case, I feel safe in assuming he's town. I believe Yates is also town, and by extension, MS, because 1) based on preceding evidence, I believe Rach is scum and 2) I don't think we'd have only one set of neighbors with scum in it, much less one (or more) scum NOT in a set of neighbors if one of the neighbors is indeed scum. In addition to this, it's unlikely there are 2 sets of neighbors AND a set of masons. The only reason I see Rach claiming masons is because she needed to secure her alignment. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">True masons would NEVER claim on day 1, <span class=\"noboldsig\">especially when neither of them were anywhere near L-1.</span></span><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5066606#p5066606\" class=\"postlink\">post 612</a>, RachMarie wrote:</cite>Which means I know Shos is TOWN and he knows I am TOWN</div></blockquote><br>Just to hammer it home, she posts this.

The last thing I did was \"copy\" your claim.  The <span style=\"font-style: italic\">obvious</span> reason I was so persistent in making you verify Nacho's claim is because I already knew I was neighbors with ETL and thought that was too many neighbors.  I still believe one of the neighbors is scum because that's what happens when you have four neighbors.  Since I know my alignment and claiming neighbors <span style=\"font-style: italic\">after</span> you claimed neighbors is exactly the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">opposite</span> of a scum move, I think the rest of this Town can be pretty safe in their knowledge of Yates-Town.  That leaves a 1/3 choice.  Nacho revealing first actually has me leaning towards noob Town so that leaves me at 1/2.  I'm less inclined to believe that my neighbor is scum versus someone that was the very definition of scum lurking and that was clearly weighing their options in regards to verifying the Nacho claim so I am VERY confident that you are going to flip scum, MS.

Assuming there's a minimum of 1 scum, that would leave 1 in 4 if lynching from the neighbor pairs, which is a much smaller pool than 1. [25%]  If you recognize that my game is pure Town?  That narrows it down to 1/3 from the neighbor list. [33%]<br><br>- If we are assuming 3 scum or 2 and an SK, there are likely two anti-Town roles in the remaining unclaimed 7. [28%]  If you rule out Ree as a scum suspect [as you appear to be doing] then your pool is really 2/6 which is exactly the same as above.

If you are actually Town Millers there is a good chance scum won't kill you for wifom reasons.  The second they kill one of you and confirm the existence of the Miller roles they would have to kill the other the next day because now we have essentially an innocent child.  Scum can't leave an innocent child out there to screw up LYLO plans.  Frankly, from a Town perspective, in this scenario you two would protect any investigative roles for two nights in a row which would have us on Day 3 with a live investigator and either two innocent results or an innocent and a guilty.  Yeah, you'd be dead but in this scenario you two would have played your roles to max benefit of Town.

Though, as in above, I have a feeling scum will avoid the 6 claimed specifically to allow for wifom and in order to confirm as little as possible.  This could also prove to be to Town benefit since \"neighbor\" doesn't necessarily mean \"VT that can talk to one person,\" if you catch my drift.<br><br>So I guess what I'm saying is that I - personally - am trying to decide between MS and Nul.

Also, let's say the \"worst case scenario\" is that the cop investigates a mason and gets an innocent read N1 and the masons are left alive for day 2 wifomy reasons.  Even if the cop panics because a mason is about to be lynched, a claim at that point leaves THREE confirmed Town for the scum to deal with.  So if they kill the cop on N2 guess what?  They just confirmed the cop's result and thus now have to spend the next two nights in a row killing the masons.  Bonus: we could have a Town protective role that covers the cop N2 so when we wake up day 3 there is no kill AND three confirmed Town.  That's pretty much the best position Town could ever hope for."}

The reason he does not have scumreads is linked to his lack of original content, that is he is afraid if his opinion is unpopular, he will attract negative attention towards himself."}

That\u2019s a real plus. Looking back at the last few pages, that\u2019s something I really really liked. It\u2019s just you were so suspicious about everyone on your wagon. Maybe it\u2019s a natural reaction that I should exopect, but I felt you were too aggressive. I can\u2019t complain, because I don\u2019t see anything wrong with the aggression.

My reasoning about his sudden - but welcome - posts coming in:<br><br>1) He did not automatically see Ree's gambit as what it was.<br>2) He was not familiar with the neighbor theory being proposed by Yates, which has been - to put it mildly - an in-depth discussion.<br>3) He only says \"why not\" after stating his Mac and Ree townreads. This suggests that, he has not been thinking deeply enough to be more articulate in his initial reads. I can make the conclusion that he was following the game <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">casually.  </span><br><br>Therefore, he likely kept up or skimmed enough to get by with a superficial knowledge of what all was going on.

That only applies if a neighbour suspects another neighbour.  Odds don't become 50% for non neighbours until one gets eliminated, and even then, it's only 50% for non neighbours.  We already went over this formula.  Scum kills a neighbour which gives the remaining town neighbour a 100% chance at finding 1 scum.  Scum kills a non neighbour, non neighbours have a better than 50% chance of finding scum among non neighbours.  Therefore, if a Mason doesn't die tonight, we are basically guaranteed scum tomorrow if we don't lynch one today.  Leave the Masons alone to confirm themselves."}

All this depends on RM and Shos being Masons and me trusting my solid read on Ree.  Is there an outside shot my read on Ree is wrong and someone pointed out his tell the day before he started playing this game?  Sure.  I guess.  But the likelihood is so random it isn't worth considering with the information we have right now.<br><br>Bottom line, one of Nul or ETL/Infinity is scum.

In addition, broom apparently didn't see my reason for voting mac, which means my reason for voting mac was probably bad (confirmation bias would normally make broom agree with my reasoning). What do you not understand about this? Oh wait, you understand it but you're just trying to make me look bad, cause you're scum."}

Also, he wasn't even in trouble. This seems more like an attempt to confirm yourself as town than anything else. And it doesn't!

WTF, is there a good side of town and a bad side of town? Then, you are going to investigate infinity tonight, while he gets NKed... that seems like a good use of time... he'll be dead if the scum take the bait. and your result won't matter at all. way to waste an investigation (and one that is potentially protected). Lets take it sentence by sentence, because there is so much wrong here.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>If I'm alive tomorrow and there is a no kill? Infinity just proved he's a doc.</div></blockquote><br>maybe. why the hell would the mafia target you when a claimed doc would say he is going to protect you? and why couldn't you, as scum, choose to put in a no kill to trick the faked save. I dunno why this helps at all.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>If I'm dead tomorrow? Infinity is scum.</div></blockquote><br>sure, whatever. If i were infinity, I would say I would save you and target someone else to try and stem off the real night kill. This option seems super unlikely to me anyways<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>If Infinity and I are BOTH dead tomorrow? This game is crazy and just lynch Mr_Ree then the Masons.</div></blockquote><br>this one i like.<br><br>so lets say your plan goes off without a hitch (for you) and you survive the night, and infinity dies a terrible death. You claim to have investigated him, and he is dead, so your result is obviously correct. That does not prove you are a cop in the least. It proves you can state the obvious. and its not like we'l get anything useful out of that because with the doc dead, the cop will die the next night (if you even are one!) Which I have doubted since you faked claimed it long ago (with the other 10 fake claims you have had)<br><br>In short, Yates I think you are lying, you are bending logic to make it seem like you will be 'proven' town, and I don't trust you.<br><br>So, with that kind of assumption, there would normally be a vote to follow. But you've set up such a situation that it feels like the mason deal all over again and that it would be foolish to lynch you today, so again, we wait.

I'll give you that there is probably one in the neighbors, and one outside, but you cannot assume to know where the (potential) last one is. And I'd be willing to bet that there is a third of some sort of scum.<br><br>and as for lynching Ree, its no guarantee that that if we lynch Ree, we can lynch Yates, as he might have been making a mistake and if we lynch them both we might flip two towns. MIGHT. Though I'd bet we've got a pretty good chance to get a scum in yates/ree. <br><br>And one of Ree's defenses that gave me pause was that he also hid Yates when he pulled him into private QT. Why would scum have that ability? Well to take him away from HIS neighbor. And if this is another Yates master plan that leads us to a mis-lynch, its really time to lynch Yates. He has lied more than any other player (proven), so its time to die.<br><br>And I'd almost be up for lynching yates first, but his claim is much stronger that Ree is scum than vice versa, and has more potential damage. Also, I get the scummies from Ree asserting that he is the only remaining power role."}

It was an awful lot to process but more than that, this game has elements and roles that I've never encountered before so I had to do research on them plus it's closed so there may be more that I'm not familiar with that are interacting with them in was that I'm unaware of and it's leaving me in the dark obviously.<br><br>I mean I know I'm not the only one it's just that I feel like I bit off a little bit more than I could chew and to see a VT self vote like that felt like an insult to all the work it took to get caught up in this game.<br><br>I'm not complaining.

If there really are Masons + Ree's claimed role in the setup, which if there aren't any other PRs then that's the only thing that makes sense, then that's three clears that scum have a really hard time getting rid of. In that case, trying to lynch the unnightkillables as much as Yates has would just be way too obvious of a move, and if the scum was thinking at all they would realize that it wasn't going to work.<br><br>Due to the how strong the claimed PR's are together, I'd think that to counter that the scum would need three members, and the best way around that would be to leave them alive, since going after them would only cause themselves harm, and kill everyone else so they can endgame the PR's.<br><br>I doubt that the scum would try to kill Ree, since there would be a really good chance that they would just end up wasting their kill. They could have specifically no-killed, but that would mean that they had something to gain from faking a protect that was worth more than someone dying. That would pretty much mean that either Ree or the Masons are actually scum. I still see no way that Ree is scum in this setup, and even though I'm less sure about the Masons, I'm leaning town on them as well. The only other option is that they tried to kill Rach. Why not Shos? Because he was the more obvious protect, so in order to kill a Mason, the scum probably tried to target the one who was less likely to be protected."}

Clearly if scum has any hope of winning, they have to be killed since I can't be.  As long as I focus on targeting Masons, this game is basically already won.  The alternative is focusing on scumpects once their numbers diminish.  The nice part is, I can talk strategy with confirmed town instead of people I have to be careful of.

That's not including how much easier dying would make my life right now.

The first is forced at this point if Fuzzy is town. If Fuzzy is actually scum, then the only real investigative results we have are WIFOM from Fuzzy. Fuzzy isn't going to claim a guilty on both of his partners because that seems like it would be far too risky given the fact that we are in LyLo and they haven't lost a member yet. There is also the chance that both Broom and Telo are town, because scumfuzzy might hope that at least one of them would go over well, forcing Nacho and Pepper to be the two remaining scum. If scumfuzzy claimed guilty on one partner and guilty on one townie, then I think it's Broom over Telo since I've never changed my mind about the scumread I had on him earlier. I'm less sure of Nacho over Pepper since my scumread on him has been degrading recently.

I think you guys underestimate the power of masons. They're two confirmed townies right off the bat. A cop first needs to get his investigations in, and survive for long enough to claim them. When balancing, I count a pair of masons as about the equivalent of a 2/3-shot cop. The fact that all three scum still managed to avoid getting lynched is a testament to their good play.<br><br>The core setup was more or less 2 Masons &amp; Doc vs. 3 Goons, which is at worst a little bit scum-sided (see for example the approved 13p open Friends and Enemies, with 3 masons vs. 3 goons - this is slightly scum-sided, but exchanging a goon for a doc and making it closed should more or less cancel that out).<br><br>The factor that I was hoping would help tilt the game towards town was the three separate neighbourhoods that existed every night. Town neighbours might not be particularly strong PR's, but the idea is of course that by discussing the game at night, Town Neighbours might be able to figure out the alignment of their neighbour. Unfortunately, much of this was negated by the early lynch of neighbours, and the fact that Ree exclusively targeted neighbours and Masons (of course through no fault of his own - I had fully intended that he use it to protect masons once they claimed. Had I bothered with more flavour this game, I would have likely gone for some sort of witness-protection description). Since there were 2 neighbourhoods and a masonry, I thought it likely you would decide that there's 1 scum among the neighbours, which splits the town into two, with 1/4 scum in the neighbours, and 2/9 scum in the rest.<br><br>As it happened, a lot in this game went badly for town, so the result may have been a bit scumsided, but I don't think there's much I would change about the setup. I considered adding a 5th VT to bring it up to 14 players, but that's no longer a mini.<br><br>One thing I didn't anticipate which I'm afraid adversely affected the game was the naming of the interrogator role. I didn't realise Interrogator is exclusively the name for a slightly altered scum version of Ree's role on EM, so I apologise for any confusion caused by that.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Modding</span><br><br>For the most part, I was able to stay on top of vote counts, deadlines, QT's and night actions. Thank you to ETL and others for stepping up with (unofficial) votecounts when I was away. One thing I take responsibility for is having to find another replacement for Infinity's slot. When he replaced in, he was the only offer I had, although he warned me he would have to replace back out. I was afraid I might not get back for at least another day, so I decided to replace him in the for the time being.<br><br>If I'm going to run another game with many QT's I should make the rule about QT-quoting more explicit. As it was, I think I'm happy with the decision of leaving Yates' slot intact, given that his QT quoting didn't give a game-altering advantage over just paraphrasing it.<br><br>Another thing I should have anticipated was how to explain Ree's role. Given that this was a normal game, I felt I should answer all questions about his role, but quoting his role PM upon request by shos was perhaps not the best way I could have handled it. From now on, in games with full flips I will post role PM's with all flips, and I'll withhold all role-information except role name and alignment in themed games.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Play</span><br><br>Night Actions<br><br>Night 1:<br>Ree interrogates Yates (success)<br>fuzzy kills stubbs (success)<br><br>Night 2:<br>Ree interrogates Rach (success)<br>Nachopappa kills Rach (failure)<br><br>Night 3:<br>Ree interrogates shos (success)<br>DoctorPepper kills Rach (success)<br><br>Night 4:<br>Ree interrogates shos (success)<br>fuzzy kills shos (failure)<br><br>Night 5:<br>Ree interrogates shos (success)<br>Nachopappa kills Ree (success)<br><br><br>As much as there were things here and there that made the game more difficult for town than it perhaps should have been, that shouldn't detract from the praise that Bert, DP, and fuzzy deserve for a flawless win. There were times when I was sure DP and fuzzy would have been lynched, but somehow they avoided it.<br><br>On the town side, Ree's gambit and claim were definitely a high point. Yates' counter-gambit was well-reasoned, and would have certainly been good play by him had I followed EM naming convention. As it was, his lynch was rather unfortunate and undeserved. A few of you had pretty good reads early on. I think stubbs basically nailed the scumteam D1, but he was of course killed N1. KA showed a good line of thought upon replacing in, and shos and Ree somewhat managed to keep the town together towards the end.

That is unless Nacho did a me and turned his neighborhood QT into a personal one.<br><br>My theories on balance is mostly coming from the fact that my only other closed normal was 10:2, with a doctor and nurse against a one-shot tracker and day-talk enabler. Despite there only being two scum instead of three, the mod actually said he thought it was scumsided postgame. I don't know if I said this yet, but one of the main reasons I referred to JK9 was because PR's in an open game pretty much double as IC's, so it's still two initial clears+investigative role. And personally I think that closed setups are always a fair amount more scumsided than open ones due to the amount of paranoia they create. Looking at Friends and Enemies, I think that the third mason would actually be more powerful than the doctor because it's losing a free clear for a chance of giving the town one more mislynch if and only if the doctor makes two successful protects over the course of the game, which the chances of are minimal. The only reason it made as much of a splash as it did here was because of Ree's bulletproof claim. That plus the fact that it was closed makes me think that it was more scumsided than anything. I should have realized though that a cop would push it way too far over the line of being townsided though.<br><br>Then again, I'm just the noob here who's only played two of these before, so I probably shouldn't talk about balancing at all. That's why I decided to mod an open instead of a closed, because as much as I scrutinize, I could never do it myself.
