If so, that's a very bad way to scum or townread someone<br><br>- the reason I scumread you is essentially the culmination of the above 3 points. Reiterated:<br>- no accounting for the experiences of other players, simply a desire to utilize this situation to force a scum or townread<br>- no curiosity over why someone might not believe<br>- inconsistency in stated reasons as to why you believed the claim.

I doubt Boon or TB thought this far but here's the thing:<br><br>Miller is anti-town utility, so it makes a lot of sense in a setup with lots of TOWN investigative utility. It has no bearing on scum investigatives at all, so someone who actually believes Transcend is scum wouldn't bother with this line of thinking. If Boon thinks there's going to be a lot of town PR's who are investigative, this would make more sense.<br><br>Eagersnake also makes less sense if he thinks Transcend is town - because if Transcend is town (and not watcher) then that IS a pretty heavy investigative setup for town, making miller make sense. Miller can be used as a false flag as well, so it could also...mean not much.<br><br>This is the only reasonable conclusion any town player should be making pre any kind of flip at all - which is why I've been wanting to know why people were taking a strong stance on either believing OR disbelieving it (either one is still possible, and we can't give SS either a coasting or to waste D1 lynch on him - imo late day1 and early-mid day2 are the best parts of the game to re-read, and very often when games are grinding to a halt, these areas of the game are super informative and will find you the last scum. <br><br>I don't want SS near lylo just in case, and I don't want to lynch him straight away on policy because it cuts out important parts of the game. <br><br>Ergo we policy lynch D2.

He puts down votes with very little justification on SS and ThinkBig, while spending a lot of time talking about why he thinks certain players are town (Transcend), and whether or not claims are believable.  This is consistent with mafia wanting to look like they're contributing without actually contributing anything to the scumhunt.  <br><br>2) His defense is emotionally inconsistent.  When a townie OMGUS's someone, it's generally very violent and emotionally confrontational.  Very \"FUCK YOU, YOU'RE MAFIA\" type of mindset.

Saying that there's no reason not to believe a Miller claim just because it was claimed in the first post (which is what you're supposed to do) is terrible.

That's fine since some people are like that. But then how does he suddenly do a 180 and become someone who gets a read in 1-2 minutes, a read so strong he'll actually defend it really strongly? <br><br>These two things don't add up. If eagersnake is town, he's been misleading about why he wasn't making reads. He was in fact, actually reluctant to even provide or share reads and had to basically be forced to even give a single scumread - why does a town player dance around the issue so much? Why don't they just say they don't have them, or that they are still forming them? Why is there a song and dance about it? <br><br>Then when they give the reason, why do they go and do the exact opposite of that? Then make the argument that I'm seemingly not happy with them either way, when that's not true - I'm not happy with the fact that these reads are basically just appeasing me. That's how it comes across - because why does a town player go from encouraging two people to start fighting again (lolwut), to having no reads, to suddenly having lots of reads - just because I asked? Only appears to try and meta dive someone after being pressured to do so? <br><br>It just reeks of scum trying to avoid my pressure, and disliking that they can't find a 'solution' to making me stop pressuring them. I don't see eagersnake as town here, but we'll see what others think."}

I hadn't read the last 10 pages when I posted that. Now I have.

It's massclaim, and if we're intending to do setup spec (which we really need to be given the claims thus far), we need to know all the claims to get an idea of the full setup. otherwise what we'll end up doing is terrible setup spec and that never works out well for town, period.<br><br>anyway, I'm surprisingly starting to lean more town on rb. (this is surprising myself because I figured after day 1 that he'd be the type of person I'd scumread regardless of alignment.)<br>and TB is still town, and not touching Eddie and Boon, and Dark is town by Boon's report. (not even going to think about the scenario where scum-boon inno's his buddy.) So my lynchpool is something like:<br>&lt;hapahauli, aronagrundy, eagerSnake, horrordude0215&gt; in preference order.<br><br>because I'm amazed hapa hasn't gotten more attention than he has, given that he has now made two pushes on players proven to be town (not counting transcend which doesn't exactly help his case but I won't hold it against him). I already explained why I didn't like the Eddie push, and I would hate his Darkshadow push even if Darkshadow weren't conftown.<br>He attacked Darkshadow for having the worst D1 vote (a vote which was basically RVS that he just happened to keep), also considering that hapa himself voted Transcend to L-1 after Transcend claimed friendly neighbor.<br>And then this post:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9048373#p9048373\" class=\"postlink\">post 1035</a>, hapahauli wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9048366#p9048366\" class=\"postlink\">post 1031</a>, rb wrote:</cite>I wanna lynch arona tbh</div></blockquote><br><br>Eh.  I understand why she looks bad, but I think Darkshadow looks worse.  Aarona doesn't look like she's trying to blend in, and there's some stuff that reads genuine in her filter.

This completely avoids any heat going on to either RB/eager while simultaneously gets pressure relieved off of himself. It also creates WIFOM if the lynch on arona goes through because we still have no idea which side arona is on due to the nature of the bussing comments earlier."}

The gameday lasted two weeks and if you are in a similar situation the next time, I'd recommend using most of that time to re-read the thread and just keep refining your reads. Look at how the mislynches happened and why. Engage everyone get their reads, ask questions and so on. Voting quickly in lylo is a trap that even experienced players fall into and the vast majority of the time, it ends up losing them the game. Notice how in the mafia PT the scumteam were stressing out at the possibility that the longer the day went on, the more likely it was that the tide would turn against them."}

The gameday lasted two weeks and if you are in a similar situation the next time, I'd recommend using most of that time to re-read the thread and just keep refining your reads. Look at how the mislynches happened and why. Engage everyone get their reads, ask questions and so on. Voting quickly in lylo is a trap that even experienced players fall into and the vast majority of the time, it ends up losing them the game. Notice how in the mafia PT the scumteam were stressing out at the possibility that the longer the day went on, the more likely it was that the tide would turn against them.</div></blockquote><br><br>And that eager still didn't make sense.

The second one is the activity level during the first 48 hours of D1 was way too high, there's a sweet spot between \"Too little content to enough reads\" and \"Too much content that people can't catch up and read it all\", the sweet spot most certainly was not hit during this D1; meant that it's exceedingly difficult for players to catch up on the game or reread it in hopes of getting a new perspective, I've noticed this is a problem sitewide throughout the last year or so (And has let to games having 700+ pages which is absurd) and an increased scum win rate is pretty noticeable alongside it, people need to really stop spamming and think through the game a little more.<br><br>Thought this was very well modded, lots of page top vote counts, always planned and ready to have the game run as smooth as possible.
