It's always a good way to get him anchored into the game early.  Getting him to react and work from that.  Unfortunately the wagon not only fell apart, but the day was cut short which had me a little worried about him.  His opening day one post was exactly what I expected from ABRTown, shitting on the bad hammer and calling out those he deemed could answer for it.

Just because you weren't the hammer doesn't mean you get to blame everyone else on the wagon (as this post attempts to do). Two, you are way too defensive-minded in your opening posts today. Where's the offense? Why are you not pissed at others on your wagon? Or those that ignored it? Where's the fire? <br>\n<br>\nABR summed it up real well, actually.

This may be the first post I liked from him all game.

His posts are a mixed bag. I like some and I dislike some. Whereas I have very clear scumreads on Scarab and Juls.

What does Juls replacing out have to do with her alignment anyway? The slot is scummy or it isn't. <br>\n<br>\nI suspect the real reason is because you wanted to take the pressure off of Skold based on <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6875148#p6875148\">349</a>. I'm curious why you didn't just say that.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nAlright, I have a few major takeaways from catching up. <br>\n<br>\nThe first big thing is I have a strong townread on <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Sotty</div>. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6851806#p6851806\">202</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6865351#p6865351\">269</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6879053#p6879053\">371</a> are really noteworthy. This is someone that is actively asking the right questions and drawing the same conclusions as I am for the most part. She's officially my mason this game and I don't see how anything short of a cop report will get me to change my mind.<br>\n<br>\nI also have a strong townread on <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">ABR</div>. Having just played on a scumteam with ABR, I feel comfortable in my ability to read him. The three major points in ABR's favor: 1) I love him coming into D2 with passion and immediately putting his sights on Juls. Whether Juls is scum or town, he made an earnest attempt to stir the pot. 2) Despite some bickering with BBT, he knew enough to lay off when appropriate. I think scum ABR may have antagonized BBT. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6867684#p6867684\">314</a> is money. That screams town mentality. He sees a player he thinks that is town (I'm assuming) but going the wrong direction, and he takes the time to tell him straight up that he's off base and needs to cool off. 3) Starting the Skold wagon is a good townplay in the sense that, like the Juls wagon, we're trying to get the town pumped up again.<br>\n<br>\nI have a third strong townread on <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">BBT</div>. BBT's reread of the game from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6862211#p6862211\">242</a> - <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6862329#p6862329\">252</a> would be hard to fake, I think. Maybe BBT is capable of it, but my best guess is that it is genuine. BBT is so analytical that him and the much more cerebral ABR are butting heads, but I hope these two achieve some sort of equillibrium that will get them on the same page. I see that hope in the Skold wagon. Additionally, I like BBT's being hard on everyone. I like that he went straight up to Sotty and got in her grill over supporting ABR too easily. That reads town. <br>\n<br>\nThat does it for my strong townreads. I have two weak townreads. The first one is on <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Zoro</div>. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6848014#p6848014\">98</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6848058#p6848058\">100</a> are good catches, 100 especially. Although I do think Sotty is town, I think Zoro is giving her a good faith grilling this early on. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6867293#p6867293\">284</a> is pretty close to townslipping in that it seems like he didn't realize that the BG was killed over the IC. Or that he forgot. Either way it's more likely to come from town than scum. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6873335#p6873335\">343</a> is okay. Additionally <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Clusk/sns</div> has just now moved up to a weak townread. I didn't have a lot to say about Clusk. I didn't think he was very bad or very good. sns' pivot to Juls was commendable though. I don't want to buy sns for town too early based on that, but <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6879100#p6879100\">372</a> is a solid point as well. I can still be convinced that Clusk may have been worse than I remember, but sns is starting well. <br>\n<br>\nI have two weak scumreads. The first is <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">PeaceBringer</div>. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6848988#p6848988\">132</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6849438#p6849438\">142</a> rubbed me the wrong way. I don't see where the Skold townread is coming from. This also ties into what's going on right now as his recent Skold vote is rather weak. I'd like him to have passion one way or the other. His lurking as of late seemed to contribute to stagnating the game and also letting ABR/BBT fight it out (two townreads of mine). The second weak scumread is <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Juls</div>. She starts the game off by attaching herself to ABR early on for no good reason in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6846806#p6846806\">32</a>. The reason is that he is too pro to let an early wagon rile him, but she doesn't really give a helpful alternative. I did like her pressuring PeaceBringer early on, but she inexplicably let up on that for the poor alternative in PB (Brain). Then we have the start of D2 where, ironically, she falls into ABR's trap. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6861140#p6861140\">232</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6861430#p6861430\">236</a> are all sorts of bad. She's way too focused on the votes on her. She opens the day with seemingly nothing to add despite the poor D1 performance. Sotty has to tell her to scumhunt because she apparently doesn't realize on her own that that would be a good move. Since this, she has been lurking and the slot is just not one I support as town.<br>\n<br>\nI have one strong scumread that I think has since outweighed both of these though. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Scarab</div> has been skating by this game and ignoring big, important events in this game. He's almost like the worst of both PeaceBringer and Juls combined. Check out <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6846764#p6846764\">22</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6846787#p6846787\">25</a> where he is selling a Skold wagon early on. Before Skold has a chance to even gain any steam, he undercuts it in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6847671#p6847671\">85</a> and votes townie PB (Brain) with a comment that the Skold and Juls wagons are bad. He doesn't explain why they are bad, even when asked to do so. This hurts the town's chances at getting multiple wagons during D1 as Brain is inevitably lynched a short while after. I'm ignoring his spat with Garmr as it has no bearing on his alignment. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6860541#p6860541\">226</a> is pretty bad for an opening post to D2. No vote. No passion. Same as Juls in that it's just not someone that is interested in figuring out what went wrong. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6864277#p6864277\">264</a> is continuing in Scarab's tradition of ignoring important things (Juls wagon, ABR vs BBT) in favor of something out of left field. He criticizes Zoro in this backwards way that I still don't fully understand. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6867290#p6867290\">283</a> we see Scarab dodging BBT's questions. This wouldn't be so bad except that BBT is one of the few players trying to get the game going and Scarab would rather stand in the way and prevent scumhunting from taking place. He then, strangely, votes BBT in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6867378#p6867378\">288</a>. Neither Zoro nor BBT was on the Brain wagon yesterday, and we already know two of the players on the wagon were town. When you look at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6867567#p6867567\">311</a>, you see that he admits to scumreading Brain, Garmr and BBT. Well, Brain and Garmr flipped town so the town thing to do is vote BBT on D2? For me, I think town would want to rethink their reads in the game. In general I strongly dislike his approach to finding scum so far, and it seems to be limited to doing it on his terms and not helping others or supporting much of anyone else. Go look for anything resembling a townread from Scarab. You won't find much of one. The closest thing is his odd <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6875148#p6875148\">349</a> where he kind of supports Skold as a townread, but isn't confident enough to come right out and say so. Lastly, we have what just happened now with the sns' Juls vote. Scarab votes Juls instead of Skold at sns' request, but almost immediately unvotes when Juls replaces out. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6879013#p6879013\">370</a> he assumes that only town Juls would replace out, but I disagree with that. Now he isn't voting anyone. <br>\n<br>\nI'm torn on <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Skold</div>. He could go either way. I only made note of a couple of his posts. I think Clusk's point against him in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6847008#p6847008\">62</a> is good and Skold's response in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6847015#p6847015\">63</a> isn't. On the other hand, I liked his attack of PeaceBringer in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6849792#p6849792\">152</a> after PeaceBringer buddyed up to him.

Before Skold has a chance to even gain any steam, he undercuts it in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6847671#p6847671\">85</a> and votes townie PB (Brain) with a comment that the Skold and Juls wagons are bad. He doesn't explain why they are bad, even when asked to do so. This hurts the town's chances at getting multiple wagons during D1 as Brain is inevitably lynched a short while after. I'm ignoring his spat with Garmr as it has no bearing on his alignment. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6860541#p6860541\">226</a> is pretty bad for an opening post to D2. No vote. No passion. Same as Juls in that it's just not someone that is interested in figuring out what went wrong. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6864277#p6864277\">264</a> is continuing in Scarab's tradition of ignoring important things (Juls wagon, ABR vs BBT) in favor of something out of left field. He criticizes Zoro in this backwards way that I still don't fully understand. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6867290#p6867290\">283</a> we see Scarab dodging BBT's questions. This wouldn't be so bad except that BBT is one of the few players trying to get the game going and Scarab would rather stand in the way and prevent scumhunting from taking place. He then, strangely, votes BBT in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6867378#p6867378\">288</a>. Neither Zoro nor BBT was on the Brain wagon yesterday, and we already know two of the players on the wagon were town. When you look at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6867567#p6867567\">311</a>, you see that he admits to scumreading Brain, Garmr and BBT. Well, Brain and Garmr flipped town so the town thing to do is vote BBT on D2? For me, I think town would want to rethink their reads in the game. In general I strongly dislike his approach to finding scum so far, and it seems to be limited to doing it on his terms and not helping others or supporting much of anyone else. Go look for anything resembling a townread from Scarab. You won't find much of one. The closest thing is his odd <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6875148#p6875148\">349</a> where he kind of supports Skold as a townread, but isn't confident enough to come right out and say so. Lastly, we have what just happened now with the sns' Juls vote. Scarab votes Juls instead of Skold at sns' request, but almost immediately unvotes when Juls replaces out. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6879013#p6879013\">370</a> he assumes that only town Juls would replace out, but I disagree with that. Now he isn't voting anyone.</div></blockquote>I only have 10ish minutes now but I want to address some of this in probably reverse-ish order.<br>\n<br>\nMy unvote of Juls wasn't because I think her replace-out would only come from town.  While I honestly would have stayed on a Juls wagon that somehow eventually led to lynch, it's not because I have any useful read on her - it's because I thought that was a better wagon than anything else that had a plausible shot of popping up.  I unvoted because I didn't care to be a part of a wagon on her that hypothetically would have popped up based off of her replacing out and then I looked back and saw that she'd said she might replace out and if I'd seen that earlier I wouldn't have bothered voting her at all until either she or her replacement were able to say something.  My day 2 play..honestly yeah, my reads are pretty much non-existent at this point.  You mentioned I haven't been giving townreads but if you look more closely I'm pretty sure you won't find me having given any scumreads day 2 other than BBT and Zoro, the latter of which I retracted back to null.  I have no idea what's going on in this game since day 1 and the thought of reading day 1 is repulsive to me (though I've read small parts of pages of day 1 for context) - though I really should do it and I will at some point.  I gave about as many townreads day 1 as I did scumreads if you count implicit things like \"x wagon is bad\" which I guess don't actually say that someone is town but...<br>\n<br>\nI've avoided engaging with the major events of this game because they've generally been thoroughly uninteresting to me.  There was the Skold wagon and the Juls wagon day 1.  I gave my opinion on them (very) briefly but had no interest in joining either of them and no interest in making any sort of real defense of either of them at that point in the game.  The fact that PBrain was \"inevitably lynched a short while after\" is something I couldn't possibly have anticipated and I wouldn't have left my vote on him if I'd expected that to happen.  His lynch happened while I was afk and it happened pretty damn fast.  I was ready to go aggro on Garmr day 2 for hammering so early on someone he didn't even seem to think was scum, but then he died and was town and at that point I was just like WELL WHAT NOW.  Which is pretty much where I'm at now.<br>\n<br>\nout of time-ish so tl;dr:  I have no idea what's going on", "time": "Wed May 20, 2015 9:59 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61783&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "61783"}

Politically, I don't believe in the concept of \"low hanging fruit\" or \"easy lynches\". Namely because it's the same odds for one of these players to draw scum as it is for them to draw town. So, you know, I'm a proponent that if a player acts scummy, then they should be called out on that regardless. Especially early on when there's less to go on anyway. So, you know, anyone that uses that argument is null to me at best and scummy at worst. In your case it was more the latter than the former given that the alternative player that was lynched, one, flipped town, and two, was arguably more of a \"low hanging fruit\" than Skold was at the time.<br>\n<br>\nThe BBT/ABR fight happened not very long ago and it's my opinion that it stems from two very different playstyles butting heads.

See, as town, that should worry you. And, for me, if I actually thought that as town in this situation, I would be fixing it immediately. You don't just go with the flow, Scarab. Not every townie has to be a leader, but every townie has to stand for something and explain it. <br>\n<br>\nThis reads like you're saying, \"I don't have a scumread on Juls but whatever as long as I don't get lynched, amirite?\"<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Scarab 381 wrote:</cite>I didn't care to be a part of a wagon on her that hypothetically would have popped up based off of her replacing out</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIn other words you jumped off because you didn't want to look scummy, not because you actually thought it was the right thing to do. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Scarab 381 wrote:</cite>You mentioned I haven't been giving townreads but if you look more closely I'm pretty sure you won't find me having given any scumreads day 2 other than BBT and Zoro</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIt's hard for me to believe no one has stuck out to you as, \"Okay, only town would say or do X\".

It's hard to tell at times which of BBT's posts from before this are meant to be serious, but the only alignment-related thought I can see from him until then is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6846871#p6846871\" class=\"postlink\">that</a>.  While I don't fault him for not having mountains of content within the first 2 pages of the game, his response to Skold's \"DO YOU BBT?\" question there is not something I would expect there from town.  It technically does answer the question Skold asked him, but it misses the point of his own rebuttal to Clusk 2 posts earlier:  Upon Clusk asking Skold if he had real opinions, BBT asked Clusk the same question presumably in order to show that Clusk was being hypocritical.  Upon being asked <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">the same question</div> one post later by Skold, it's sketchy for BBT to answer \"yes\" when the only serious opinion he's given is a scum read on Sotty that wasn't strong enough to make him move his RVS vote.  It's just misleading.  And then when Clusk actually went ahead and voted Skold in the very next post (which BBT had to have seen shortly after based on timestamps), BBT followed him onto Skold.  Then day 2 BBT apparently suddenly noticed this situation and called it scummy for Clusk.

I thought he was scum and it should be clear enough from my day 1 posting that if I'd had to choose a single player from the playerlist to be lynched at the exact moment I voted him, I would have chosen him.  Does any of that make it seem at all likely to you that I did actually want him lynched at exactly that moment?  Does any of that make you think that I should have expected to afk with 3 or 4 votes on PBrain and return to find that he'd been quicklynched?  Unless you're trying to tell me that I should be unvoting anyone I don't want to be flashwagoned and quicklynched while afk, you're making no sense at all.<br>\n<br>\nUltimately, using PoE on a wagon that ended in quicklynch is lazy at best and....just wrong.  Yes, it's likely at least one scum was on the wagon.  It's also likely at least one scum was off the wagon.  That's true simply by combinatorics/probability and not by any sort of magical \"there must have been x scum on this wagon\" rule.  Doubly so for a wagon that was quickhammered by 2 players who we at this point know to be town, since that pretty much eliminates the \"scum pushed this wagon through\" possibility.  If you think my vote on PBrain was scummy in and of itself, then you are free to think so, but there's no way I'm going to let you get away with calling me scummy just for being 1 of 4 people you haven't yet PoE'd out of a lynch wagon.<br>\n<br>\nSo tell me, RC, since it was, to use your words, up to other players to figure out what my intentions were with my pbrain vote, tell me what you think my intentions were that cause your opinions about this to make sense.

I didn't read the stuff in spoilers.  I'll try to be brief.  Agree on Sotty for the most part.  I wouldn't say she is 'masony' but one of my stronger town reads.  ABR, I am fine with leaving him a lone for now.  I haven't played with him in a long time (if at all?) when he was scum.  I have played recentish games with him where he was town and I am not seeing anything crazy jumping out at me.  BBT we are starting to disagree here.  I found the ABR/BBT argument to feel staged.  You just played with ABR as scum.  Is this something he would do?  On Zoro, we are the opposite.  I find him to be one of my bigger scum reads.  I just have not seen a single thing that makes me go \"yep, he's scum hunting.\" I realize that's hypocritical of me given my state day one but that's how I feel.  I agree on Clusk/sns, a weak town read based mostly on his post 140 noted earlier.  PB is a big scum read for me, agreed.  Scarab as well, so agreed.<br>\n<br>\nAs for your comments regarding me.  I have already addressed my ABR 'attachment'.  I didn't really want to push an ABR wagon.  I wanted a wagon I felt better about.  It's really not any deeper than I like ABR and didn't want to RVS him this game.  Not sure I was 'pressuring' Peacebringer.  I did ask him the question about why his vote didn't return to me.  I was satisfied at the time with his answer.  And the Brain did  that awful vote on me and I switched gears.  This all happened real time, we were posting back and forth so my vote on Brain was an in-the-moment read/vote.  Let me be clear, I did think his vote reasoning was weak and I read that as scummy.  I'm not trying to absolve myself from his lynch but I certainly didn't think he would be hammered.  I think I put him at L-2.  I agree with you that my performance D1 was bad so if I fell into ABR's 'trap' so be it.  I hate when I am town and I play bad but then I am forced to justify bad play.  I never really know what to say.  So I will just own it. Do what you must with it. I had trouble getting into this game.  But Sotty didn't have to tell me to scum hunt.  Again, this all happened real time.  Sotty said that whilst I was preparing a post with my thoughts/reads.<br>\n<br>\nRed <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6883728#p6883728\" class=\"postlink\">387</a> - The points on Scarab are very well made here.  Especially the part about jumping off because he/she didn't want to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">look</div> scummy.  This post sold me on Scarab-scum.<br>\n<br>\nSnc <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6884629#p6884629\" class=\"postlink\">395</a> - I agree with what you say about BBT.  I have never played with BBT but my husband did and I followed that game pretty closely.  He was scum but he was very good at being analytical and giving lots of thoughts.  I imagined at the time that his town-game would be very similar. <br>\nAs to your comment about me, what interactions between Peace and I did you find 'fake'?  I don't recall you mentioning this previously.  (looks like this question was asked twice...did you answer?)<br>\n<br>\nScarab <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6887721#p6887721\" class=\"postlink\">402</a> - The fact that you read only the part about you in Red's post is scummy.  That is a very scum thing to do, only be concerned with his read on you.  It would seem to me that if you needed help getting acquainted with the game you would read his post because it was full of thoughts that might spur more thoughts for you.  Also, your votes are all over the place. It feels like you are just throwing names at the wall to see what sticks.<br>\n<br>\nBBT <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6888769#p6888769\" class=\"postlink\">409</a> - I like the point about Skold 'pre-emptively jumping on ABR'.  <br>\n<br>\nZoro <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6890651#p6890651\" class=\"postlink\">420</a> - First post I actually like by Zoro.  The pushing for ABR-scum reasons from Skold is a good push.<br>\n<br>\nPB <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6891940#p6891940\" class=\"postlink\">423</a> - noting this in case Scarab flips scum.<br>\n<br>\nSotty <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6892404#p6892404\" class=\"postlink\">427</a> - Agreed.  I have no true scum/town read on Skold but this can't be denied (that he is drawing out to deadline).<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n-----------<br>\n<br>\nSo my reads are Town to Scum (gaps for levels of reads):<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">RedCoyote (Ankamius)</div> - superb entrance into the game.  Wiped away any negatives I was feeling about Ankamius.  I don't agree with everything he says but I can still see town-motivations in the things he says.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Sotty7</div> - I didn't like her vote on me entering into Day 2 but everything else has been pretty good.  I even liked her later-explained motivations for voting me (because of lack of scum-hunting). <br>\n<br>\n----<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">snscompt1 (Clusk92)</div> - Light town read based primarily on the one question that Clusk asked PB about his defense of Skold.  I really don't see that catch coming from scum.<br>\n <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Albert B. Rampage</div> - His play is fine.  The only thing I have really noted is some manufactured-feeling interactions with BBT.  I do wish he would participate more so I could get a better read on him.  He is lacking some of the passion I have seen from him as town.  Although that is relative with ABR.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">BlueBloodedToffee</div> - I had him below this tier but moved him back up last minute.  Something is off to me but he isn't the most scummy in the game.  I felt early day one his play felt natural but I have noted a few things above that are a little concerning.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Skold</div> - I don't really have a read on his game play because he hasn't got much of that but I agree that his absense (not just being absent but the way he is being present as little as possible) can't be denied.  I would vote him if we had a fast-approaching deadline.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">PeaceBringer</div> - One of the main things about PB are his 'catch up' in which I feel he had predesigns to vote for me because I was the leading wagon and he manufactured his 'catch up' so he could do that and also the way he backed off of me once he started getting called out on it.  And also some questionable votes/unvotes (see notes above)<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Zoronos</div> - In 20 pages Zoronos has exactly one post that I feel like he is scum hunting.  The rest are just noise.  Even when he does 'analyze' it reads as theory.  I couldn't tell you much about his feelings on the scuminess of anyone except for Skold.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Scarab</div> - Scarab has been all over the place and I think RedCoyotes case on him/her is pretty sound.  Main points being: all over the place throwing darts at the wall to see which one will score and that he/she is trying to not 'look scummy' instead of being town.  That's further evidenced by reading only the part about him/her in the RedCoyote wall.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Scarab</span><br>\n<br>\nSorry for the wall...I'm tired now.", "time": "Wed May 27, 2015 2:16 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61783&start=475", "forum": "53", "thread": "61783"}

Unless they expected her to be replaced in the immediate future -- which, to be blunt, would've been a guaranteed slot upgrade -- there was enough material in Day 1, despite its length, to target someone else. There's also a non-zero chance of mafia directly targeting Garmr; he was subtly offensive for most of his posts, and, personally, I would've used up a NK to get rid of him. I might go through the end of Day 1 again once I finish catching up to see if there's any merit to any of this. BlueBloodedToffee immediately dismissing NK analysis as \"WIFOM\" in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6875752#p6875752\" class=\"postlink\">post 353</a> rubs me the wrong way.<br>\n<br>\nOff-the-cuff thoughts: Skold felt like he was trying to elongate RVS for as long as possible, which was scummy considering this specific RVS. I thought his frustration in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6846998#p6846998\">post 60</a> for being targeted for his RVS antics felt genuine and possibly town, but that was the extent of my town read of Skold. Clusk92 said something early in Day 1 that pinged as mildly town, too, but that's been gone. Juls is probably town, and I don't see her in a scum team without Sotty7. Zoronos seems like town. Scarab does, as well; I really liked the posts where Scarab had mistakenly gone after Zoronos due to misreading the latter's posts because I don't see scum thinking in that manner, and I agree with Zoronos's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6892496#p6892496\" class=\"postlink\">post 428</a>. That said, what RedCoyote said concerns me and is worth a look back. PeaceBringer is probably town? He comes across as someone who isn't concerned with public image (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6850897#p6850897\">post 169</a> from Juls outlines this nicely). If someone can tell me if he is similar or different as scum, I'd be all ears.<br>\n<br>\nThere's more, but the TL;DR of all of this is basically that I barely have any reads at all! I'd vote Skold if deadline was imminent. Fortunately, it's not, so I'm going to wait until I've combed through the thread again to actually read the complicated posts with links (e.g., BlueBloodedToffee, Juls), some specific things, and Scarab.

It is the same game, there are as many different ways to interact as there are people.<br>\nI play the game far differently then you do and far differently then most people on the site. The game is about an uninformed minority and a informed majority who lies and tries to blend in. You throw in different elements that give certain uninformed, certain information.  You can find the truth by certain # of ways. Eventually it comes down to a claim, information, and a flip and then sorting out behavior based on varied elements.  You have a certain expectation of behavior.  So scum hunting comes down to focusing on certain behavioral expectations. Yet, even those expectations are poorly followed and managed and it is all about who you like and don't like.  I see certain trends followed over and over, often to poor results. I have seen some good results from certain things. Sometimes I can get a sense, other times I do not. I am highly intuitive. I also am a student of human behavior. I gauge reactions. Sometimes I don't have clue and flop around. None of it points to whether I am town or scum.  So rather than ask me what my motivation is and try and learn how I play the game and what I do, you just calm me scum and stop trying to really sort anything else out. So, then when I do come up town, you are screwed and got no direction and probably do not re-evaluate your other perceptions, because you were locked in on something so horrid.", "time": "Sat May 30, 2015 12:53 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61783&start=575", "forum": "53", "thread": "61783"}

And then tell me what about the engagement moved you from a \"town\" read based on little to the point of making deals with folks, to now me being a flash wagon you would hope on?

I did forget about this game a bit.  This day started off with some prodding, I forgot about the game briefly, came back. I had thoughts in my mind on Skold being suspect he was run up. Folks dragged along, dragged along, dragged along, and dragged along some more. Drag so freaking long that right into deadline with nothing doing.  I wanted to hear from skold and see where things went to evaluate, but things just dragged.  Yet, you focus, your attention has suddenly come to me. Like I am the reason for this and that there was something I could have done differently. Skold became a top suspect, I had questions and intuition pinging me on the slot. Why don't you call out the majority of the other players in this thread, even those replacing in for crying out loud.  Sometimes here it becomes a game of chicken... it is one element that can get me going back to skold and have no problem letting him swing. It is the sit back, don't engage, don't do anything right up till deadline.  It is super annoying, but nothing in my bag of skills and things I do to hunt scum would have turned things around and there is certainly enough here to gain some useful information to narrow things down on scum if you ask me...<br>\nbut hey, I must be a non-engaging scum. He, my prodding of you actually was in this day, imagine that. I thought it was day one. I had to go back and look.  <br>\nWhat did you think of the Skold counter wagons, if you want to talk about scum hunting?  You had heat building on Juls again and then swapped over to scarab when he bit on it?  How about others behaviors?

I'm not in charge of anyone's vote except my own. From the word go I have shown displeasure with the Skold wagon in a relative sense that has only gradually increased as the day progressed. Originally I had three players that I saw as better lynch candidates than Skold. Since then, Skold has done nothing that has made him look any worse in my eyes, yet Peace, sns and Scarab/pisskop all have. Therefore, I've grown increasingly impertinent with how stubborn you and ABR cling to this. Skold was a for all intents and purposes meant to be a \"let's flash wagon a lurker to get this game going\", which is perfectly fine... but then I presented a better alternative to be weighed on its own merit. Then sns did. Then Juls did. It would've been nice to see either of you give us more than, \"hm, yeah, that's interesting\". I don't think it's in the town's best interest generally to just park your vote somewhere for virtually the entire day and then get mad when they don't concede to you at the 11th hour.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, this is a long way of saying that by no means should I be held accountable for this shoddy case/wagon you and ABR are attempting to drag across the finish line. You know as good as anyone the only reason this wagon still holds traction is because ABR has flaked on us and you have stubbornly held firm. Because I have townreads on both of you, I'm left with very little to work with here. <br>\n<br>\nI will help the Skold wagon finish should it be necessary, but I'm absolutely not culpable for players like BBT, Juls, sns and Peace (whomever is town among them) actually wanting to scumhunt and move their vote around.

But let me address you points. <br>\nPlease point me to deflection and my being demur.  I probed the slot for a response, it is what I do.  I got a reaction and moved.  I did get a sense of you as town. You actually hadn't \"accused\" me of anything, you probed me.  Then you point to D2... it was a long day, so your perception is faulty. I started out engaging, had the whole Juls bit, then I actually forgot about the game. When I got re-engaged in the game we had the scarab and skold run up. Skold showed enough for me to question and saw no need to go elsewhere as folks were dragging and dragging things out. Then checked on where things were at near the end with sotty coming out saying absolutely do not lynch SNS.    The truth of the matter is \"having a hard time following logic.\"  I am INTUITIVE. I don't necessarily follow logic. So you being the opposite type are going to struggle. Take a look at my games and take a look where I come from <a href=\"https://forums.footballguys.com/forum/index.php?/topic/643460-cowboys-vs-zombies-official-game-thread/\" class=\"postlink\">https://forums.footballguys.com/forum/i ... me-thread/</a> (whoda sinkitis).   And the funny thing is, you claim I haven't sorted town from scum yet you complained that my early town declaration was scummy...  <br>\nnow please give me facts of things that actually are what scum do, are something scum me way do and why? If you can or you just so bogged down in confirmation bias, or are you looking for an easy lynch?  See, anyone can make a case on anyone in the game... oh, sorry more talking about game vs \"scum hunting\"  Go check me out then get back to me or not.", "time": "Tue Jun 02, 2015 1:34 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61783&start=725", "forum": "53", "thread": "61783"}

Skold questioned him on it, and he deflected back onto attacking Skold's Jules read. The demurement was when he reiterated that he had never called Clusk scum (as contrasted to calling his post a 'load of crap').<br>\nHe was only willing to commit to a town read when pressured. Before I went after him, it was 'I wanted to take a shot at you and see what I get back. It worked' and telling Clusk to 'deal with it'.<br>\n<br>\nD2 stuff:<br>\nBacking off Skold:<br>\nHe claimed he was town reading Clusk D1, who turned into SNS. So, PB town read Clusk D1, he never said anything about it during the play of D2 other than to ask about SNS's statement vis-a-vis PB / Jules interactions (which I agreed was a bit fishy but w/e), then was willing to vote it D2. Now you've replaced into that slot, it's back to a town read. That doesn't read particularly towny to me. Voting town reads is something I find scummy unless reasoning is supplied; Mind changing is fine, but if someone is willing to just straight off vote their town reads without talking through, that's scummy.<br>\nCoincidentally, that was my problem with your slot, but with Sotty vouching for you, well, I work with what I've got. In this case, Peace was specifically willing to vote a prior town read after that player thought Peace was scum.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I have a lot of trouble following Peace's logic. I find the way he constructs posts makes them very hard to read (Not read as in get an alignment read, read as in successfully parse the English language.)<br>\n<br>\nJuls stuff:<br>\nEhh... it looked to me like Peace started it the post before that; <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6909980#p6909980\">577</a>. But you're right, Juls aided and abetted the meta-discussion.<br>\n<br>\nList o' items:<br>\n- D1 being 'natural / easy' I can't really argue since that's a subjective measure, and I'm not even sure it's alignment indicating. His 'Oh she's a noob' read seemed really off, since Join Date is next to everyone's name. <br>\n- He only established the town read once Skold and I leaned on him (as stated above). The town motivation is to announce the read as soon as its generated. Not when somebody forces it. <br>\n- Yeah... this one's a good point. Scum Peace there can just sit on the vote, or just not say anything about it. That speaks against a scum motivation.<br>\n- 590 / 593 do seem to have genuine frustration. My problem with those posts is that Sotty's underlying point is right; Peace has been playing almost entirely reactively. He posts verbosely when people suspect him, but very little when people aren't talking about him.</div></div></div>", "time": "Fri Jun 05, 2015 11:02 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61783&start=850", "forum": "53", "thread": "61783"}

I'm a VT.<br>\n<br>\nJuls went from posting regularly, to only showing up on my radar with long catch-up posts, to duking it out with BBT yesterday where I thought they both looked bad. So she's gone from good to bad, to worst, and worst. She's been wanting to lynch me/pb/bbt/pisskop/zoros. She's been agreeing / townreading GC for a long time, but GC isn't the type to be so easily flattered into submission. Good chance at hitting scum here.<br>\n<br>\nPisskop got into a similar argument with BBT yesterday. He regurgitates pretty much the same thing Juls says, like BBT is scum, my hammer is bad (pisskop hammered Skold on page 27 when no one else wanted to), both of them were also on Prolapsed Brain. There's a lot of similar leanings between the two. <br>\n<br>\nPB has never been under any heat, some straggler votes here and there from Juls and Zoronos, and that's it.

Basically, if he's town he's been as bad as me this game.<br>\n<br>\nOK Zoronos is pretty consistent with his PB read, but he's never gained any momentum or support for it. He's a newbie by join date, but he doesn't really feel like one by his analysis, which I've agreed with when I read them but never really had any strong feelings for or against.<br>\n<br>\nWe've lost the will to fight.

I originally thought that this was the case, but the folks who first floated this idea were town (BBT).<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n(3) RC was more right than wrong in his reads - that is, he was (say) 2/3rds right on PB/Juls/Scarab being scum, and only only 1 wrong about a townread.<br>\n<br>\nThis would probably be the biggest motivator for scum to get rid of RC, moreso than RC just simply being right about 1 single scum player.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nALSO, sidenote, if I was ABR-scum, why would I want to kill one of my strongest defenders?  I know ABR is an unconventional player, but I don't see why he would want to play this game on HARD MODE vis-a-vis killing RC.  This is a huge hiccup in scumreading ABR for me, but I guess it's not insurmountable.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nALSO ALSO, I think it's worth nothing that scum might have thought RC was PR hint-dropping: \"The first big thing is I have a strong townread on Sotty. 202, 269 and 371 are really noteworthy. This is someone that is actively asking the right questions and drawing the same conclusions as I am for the most part. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">She's officially my mason this game and I don't see how anything short of a cop report will get me to change my mind.</div>\"<br>\n<br>\nMAYBE.  I don't know.  That's a stretch, because wtf would RC have dropped such a hint in his first substantive replace-in post? dumb, dumb, dumb.<br>\n<br>\nThat said, even if scumteam thought RC was PR dropping (investigative role or mason role), if I were ABR-scum, I wouldn't have killed RC.  If RC was mason, there's no benefit in getting rid of that 1/2 of the masonhood.  If RC was an investigative role, you know who RC probably wouldn't be investigating?  One of his strongest townreads, based off of RC's immediately prior experience with the scum version: ABR.  In contrast, you know who RC probably would be investigating?  One of the trio of suspected scumreads.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nUltimately, RC's town read of ABR held throughout D2.

Here are my findings:<br>\n<br>\nABR has 26 posts in which he is interacting with/mentioning the other 3.  Of those, a massive 22 are interactions with PK.  That is unnatural.  Compare that with only 4 for Zoro and 3 with PB.  The interactions with Zoro are benign, not really interacting at all, more simple acknowledgements of other peoples (mine) comments on him.  The pb interactions are even worse because he banters with him once, and has him in reads list the other two. <br>\n<br>\nPB's interactions are mostly with Scarab/PK and Zoros.  The interactions with scarab are mostly fluff (see 115, 120, 160, 352, 743).  Only once does he mention scarab/pk in a game context (741) where he says Scarab's reads are weak.  Two things really caught my attention in PB's interactions though.  First, was his summary of reads in 736.  On the 3 other suspects his reads are \"don't know\", \"can't sort\", and \"flipping back and forth\".  This really reads as keeping his options open to jump which ever way that day swings.  Second, and the most damning for me, is in 1100.  He has been calling Zoro scum for most of the day but he says \"I am just trying to break through your stubborn perspective\".  That's a slip.  He is acknowledging that he KNOWS Zoros is town but that he is being stubborn.  When I read this, my 75% certainty jumped to 99.9% certainty.<br>\n<br>\nScarab/PK was a little hard to go through admittedly without OMGUS but I tried to be impartial.  I've already mentioned all the interactions with ABR.  The biggest thing that struck me with him is the evolution (or more apt, lack there of) of his reads.  On Day 3, post 740, he says me and PB are is scum reads.  He starts the day with his scum suspects as Zoro, Juls, ABR/PB in that order (post 940).  He reiterates in 976 he will vote Zoros/Juls.  Reiterates again in 978, same order.  Where did his scum read of PB go?  In 980 he says he isn't going to vote ABR when he can vote someone he knows is scum.  Then he votes ABR in 1013 and unvotes him 8 minutes later in 1024.  Similarly, ABR votes (post 1012) and unvotes pk (post 1017) within 5 minutes.  It all reads as setup.  He quickly drops all suspicion of ABR and starts talking about me once GC indicates he will vote me.  He only mentions PBs lurking but never indicates his willingness to vote.  The drop off of Zoros is the only thing that gives me a connection here (and Zoros calling him town most of the game which I will get to next).<br>\n<br>\nLastly, Zoros.  As far as interactions with the other 3, they are mostly with Scarab/PK and PB.  He asks a few times for Skold to explain his suspcions of ABR and asks ABR to talk to him at one point but thats pretty much it.  With Scarab, Zoros spends several posts defending scarab in the early game and kinda keeps that town read throughout the entire game.  The only note of frustration with PK comes in 1083 and 1086 where he is asking pk to respond to his case on pb.  He has held a suspicion of pb since around 868 (maybe earlier?).  <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSo if I had to break it down by most to least likely partners, it would be:<br>\n<br>\nABR---&gt;PK, PB, Zoros<br>\nPB ---&gt;PK, Zoros, ABR<br>\nPK ---&gt;ABR, PB, Zoros<br>\nZoros---&gt;PK, PB, ABR<br>\n<br>\nIf you want to break that down by points (3 to highest propability , 1 to lowest) you have:<br>\nPK (3+3+3) = 9<br>\nPB (2+2+2) = 6<br>\nABR (3+1+1) = 5<br>\nZoros (1+2+1) = 4<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThat's all I got, do with it what you will.  GC, I ask that you at least read it.  And you too Equinox.  I'd love some feedback.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: PK</span>", "time": "Sat Jun 13, 2015 4:15 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61783&start=1100", "forum": "53", "thread": "61783"}

I mean 3 townie confirmed is tough to overcome (but...in the good news department...something about this game gave me a good setup idea...though I doubt I will ever have time to run it).  I just think if one of us had got lynched early on, then town would be so OP.  We only won because we didn't get lynched.  <br>\n<br>\nWith regards to Garmr.  I played up my 'emotional reaction' some.  Town Juls tends to be emotional.  Juls in general tends to be emotional.  It's something I am working on.  I think you hit below the belt somewhat too with the pirate mollie comment.  She and I have spoke in private, there was no reason to say that shit.<br>\n<br>\nI probably like playing with ABR more when I don't know his alignment.  Our play styles are so different as scum.
