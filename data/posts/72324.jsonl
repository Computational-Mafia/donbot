The most important rule - ALWAYS be respectful to the other players. Remember to attack the argument and not the player. If things get too heated I will step in as necessary. Each individual player will be afforded a single warning for breaking the rules against personal attacks. Breaking the rules after being warned will result in being force-replaced.<br><br>2.) Day Phases will be 2 weeks long, and only extended as necessary. Night Phases will be 3 days long.<br><br>3.) During the Day Phase players will vote on who they want lynched. When a majority of players have voted for a player that player will be lynched and the Day Phase will end.<br><br>4.) During the Night phase players will submit any Night Actions they have.<br><br>5.) No trick votes. If I think it is a vote or it looks like a vote I will count it.<br><br>6.) If you aren't sure about anything, ask me. I will answer any question as I am able as long as it doesn't break the integrity of the game.<br><br>7.) If you think I've made a mistake, PLEASE let me know and I'll try to correct any mistakes I may have made.<br><br>8.) Don't quote your role PM or mod communications or even pretend to. Breaking this rule will result in an immediate modkill. <br><br>9.) Not_Mafia is the backup mod for this game.

If he's town I really want him to start taking this game seriously, that goes for everyone really. But for now I've provided what I feel are 5 good reasons as to why he should be lynched. <br><br>I'm at l-2 basically cause I'm mad that this was run as an open game and I'm annoyed that I'm playing with a bunch of EM players because they typically don't take mafia seriously (oh look they aren't taking it seriously here either. I'm shocked /sarcasm) and because I'm aggravated somebody had the nerve to think that is somehow alignment indicative cause I'm faking my frustration. <br><br>It's bullshit. At this point I hope I'm lynched because that will expose RB as scum or just a really terrible player and I will expect him to be lynched Day 2. I'll still hang onto hope it happens d1 but that seems unlikely. <br><br><br>There is literally nothing else to talk about right now cause the rest is just shit posting.

I'll go check if it's normal for you to do as town but right now it feels like you're squirming out of any accountability for your read. It also reminds me of what I feel scum tend to do in EM games when asked to give reads; instead of saying \"this person's scummy because they did this and it seems scum\" they like to justify their reads by either talking about why the person is doing something they dislike, emotionally, or just listing something like \"lurking\" as a reason that they didn't come up with in that one game, and therefore didn't have to actually consider the specific person's *alignment* to come up with.

This paragraph just seems kinda contradictory to me- if you want to expand/argue against that might be a bit helpful.<br><br>I think cloudkicker makes a lot of claims but doesn't really give much explanation for them (ex. posts 65, 152, 153) which almost feels townie, as if he doesn't need to explain himself because he knows it's right, which I don't like but also don't think scum would do.

So if you were scum you'd be trying to push a town lynch early in the game.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>rb wrote:</cite>b) same question as to myko, since this is basically just the same thing myko said - how does one respond to an accusation about their meta without clarifying their meta?<br><br>I didn't go out of my way to pre-explain myself as having high toxicity as town and then going and being toxic.

I'll go check if it's normal for you to do as town but right now it feels like you're squirming out of any accountability for your read. It also reminds me of what I feel scum tend to do in EM games when asked to give reads; instead of saying \"this person's scummy because they did this and it seems scum\" they like to justify their reads by either talking about why the person is doing something they dislike, emotionally, or just listing something like \"lurking\" as a reason that they didn't come up with in that one game, and therefore didn't have to actually consider the specific person's *alignment* to come up with. I don't know if this sounds coherent or not, but my point is that you did both of these things in your explanation that resemble this. </div></blockquote>Sorry if I got this wrong, but didn't I list 2 things that rb had done that seemed scum to me, which was one of the things you listed as townie? This paragraph just seems kinda contradictory to me- if you want to expand/argue against that might be a bit helpful.<br><br>I think cloudkicker makes a lot of claims but doesn't really give much explanation for them (ex. posts 65, 152, 153) which almost feels townie, as if he doesn't need to explain himself because he knows it's right, which I don't like but also don't think scum would do. Going to look into them more tomorrow morning after sleep.<br><br>Also sorry but what was rb's question? I don't see him asking me anywhere prior to this post?<br><blockquote><div><cite>rb wrote:</cite>So flairs, how is a) arguing we shouldn't try hard as opposed to, \"I think I've found scum but won't agonize over it and drag out the day and demotivate everyone\"?</div></blockquote>Uh it feels like something scum would do- we've got two weeks for day 1 and scum would probably want to lynch a townie the first chance they got so that there's less a chance of one of them being lynched. So if you were scum you'd be trying to push a town lynch early in the game.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>rb wrote:</cite>b) same question as to myko, since this is basically just the same thing myko said - how does one respond to an accusation about their meta without clarifying their meta?<br><br>I didn't go out of my way to pre-explain myself as having high toxicity as town and then going and being toxic. Myko brought it up. Also, my wiki page has been like that for much longer than I've had my role PM for this game, so again - how is that relevant to my alignment here?</div></blockquote>Well see that's the point, the fact that you have these preset definitions and expectations means you know what people are looking for when they look for town!rb, so you would have the abity to act the way town!rb would and have some sort of higher authority back you up on the fact that you're \"town\" when really you're scum (sorry dense sentance just tell me if I need to clarify)<br>Alao, you wouldn't have to respond to accusations about your meta if you didn't try to defend yourself with it in the first place.</div></blockquote> I think this is towny and the reasoning makes sense lol. 10/10 pro scumhunter here"}

Just...no?<br><br>Scum almost always stall out the unnecessarily long deadlines and are responsible for so many lost games on this site because town never gains any momentum. Games grind to a halt and people lose focus/interest which is the death of town functioning.<br><br>There's a reason that this site has shit town winrates with super long deadlines compared to a lot of places with very short deadlines.<br></div></blockquote>Oh that's interesting, in my experience (in two newbie games, so it might not be so credible) whenever someone has tried to lynch early they're pegged as scum. And I feel like logically, scum would want to keep the day as short as possible so they say as little as possible that could potentially point towards them being scum. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>rb wrote:</cite>I think you're very wrong on some stuff but I actually think your 'mindset' is correct for town.

I'm not entirely sure if this is scummy or just his playstyle, since there aren't many other people who have pointed it out. I originally thought that not explaining was a town move, but after Impoetic's explanation of town vs. scum explanations I'm not so sure."}

My emotions are preventing me from unvoting him right now, but they aren't what is pushing the scum read.<br><br>everyone keeps saying he is obv town yet nobody has taken me up on my request for examples. his emotional appeal doesn't make him town. his lack of scum hunting doesn't make him town, his fake self hammer doesn't make him town, his meta defense doesn't make him town.<br><br>all of those are either null or scummy. <br><br>now he claims he didn't parrot you, I completely disagree but fine let's say he didn't.<br><br>he still refused to answer my question about it. If he didn't parrot you if he were town I would expect him to respond originally denying it and moving on. he didn't. that is scummy<br><br>he still reacted poorly when he was criticized for not giving effort and he almost immediately came back and tried to show he was giving effort. That right there is extremely scummy because he's been trying to come off like an asshole on purpose towards me, cause I looked like easy lynch bait. When he does it towards somebody else who isn't lynch bait he has to check himself and try and make sure he stays on myk's good side. That is scummmmmmmy as fuck. <br><br>he only wants to look good to the people he think he can buddy, and be a dick to the people he think he can mislynch. That is a scum mindset. not a town one.<br><br>so if he isn't going to be lynched today, i'll deal with it but he has done absolutely NOTHING that looks town. and all the people who say he is town is doing NOTHING to support their arguments. <br><br>I am not accepting meta or gut for a reason to town read somebody when I have actual examples of bad play. <br><br><br>So what makes him town? everyone who has called him town needs to explain why or shut the hell up about it and vote him. He is going to be the biggest distraction this game and he is not going to be helpful, since he hasn't been yet."}

I'm really tired and need to go to sleep, but a few quick initial thoughts.<br>My strongest townreads are rb, Impoetic, and mykonian.  As such, I will be removing my slot's vote from rb.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Transcend</span><br><br>There's the matter of his gerry read, which I have a couple issues with, but what I think is scummiest about him is how he's interacted with rb.  For one, the rb defense reads as exaggerated and melodramatic to me.  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9364276#p9364276\">Post 507</a> is a prime example of this.  For the showiness behind \"rb could carry the game,\" Transcend's approach to a couple rb's reads are shockingly flat.  The most striking examples of what I'm talking about are Impoetic and gerryoat.  rb has now unequivocally said three times that <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9363713#p9363713\" class=\"postlink\">he's</a> <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9367910#p9367910\" class=\"postlink\">townreading</a> <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9368008#p9368008\" class=\"postlink\">Impoetic</a>.  Not only is Transcend currently voting her, he's also not bothered to ask rb about why he's townreading her.  There's also the gerryoat read.  gerry is apparently one of Transcend's top townreads since pretty much the beginning of the game, yet when rb said he wasn't <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9365031#p9365031\" class=\"postlink\">confident about gerry being town</a> Transcend did not bother to explain why gerry's place on his townreads was secure.  In summary, I would expect a lot more of an effort on Transcend's part to synchronize reads for all his talk about how great he thinks rb is.  The lack of it makes me think it's all lip service."}

Gerry/Transcend had poor naked votes, and he was at L-2. If he fake claimed cop that's asking to be lynched. Sure, scum would be able to potentially kill off a counter claim by the cop, but that's risking a big chance of no kill. If he was faking a cop claim, he'd be outted as scum, and even if the cop died, he would have gotten us one scum. If Flairs was scum, and him and his partners were panicking, maybe I could see them telling him to claim that, but I don't see Flairs doing that on his own as scum."}

I disagree but I don't think we can sync, I don't think she'll relent on it and...I actually don't want her to either. I'm not entirely sure on Transcend in this game because he's also a very enthusiastic scum player and he will fight through bad gamestates to be active and involved when he's scum. When he's town he rarely does this, and despite knowing Transcend flips votes around a lot, his justification of it as \"I flip votes a lot\" is actually fairly scummy from my POV. If myko flips town, and so does matt and Boonskiies, he's basically wrong about literally everything and I don't think Transcend is just that wrong about that much*<br>- she hasn't explained creature yet, I'm hoping we can come to an understanding<br><br>*and I want TTH to not relent on this because:<br>- TTH isn't tunneling and letting it confbias her entire game<br>- I think town should always stay focussed on their top scumread<br>- TTH has made salient points and the fact I'm townreading her gives me confidence that she'll be an important player later on in the game<br><br>If I die at night, I'm basically trusting that the town players in this game will make the right decisions because right now this is indeed looking like a scum win if I'm dead wrong about some of this stuff and potential scum!Transcend ends up powertowning it in the later days of the game, ESPECIALLY if Flairs really is cop and gets killed. Transcend being proud of it under the guide of \"mah scumhunting abiliteez\" also reads kind of 'off' to me, but again he hams up his town playstyle with shit like this a lot (as a byproduct of his personality imo - I don't think it's intentional actually).<br><br>So let's see where the game goes. I feel right now the game is stuck between two pathways, and one of the pathways leads to scum lynches. If I'm wrong about a lot of things, then TTH is inadvertently right about some stuff. Possibly myko as well. If there's bussing involved, that would explain it - so I feel like there IS bussing involved at this point, as right now this game feels exactly like there's scum bussing (or at least medium-heavy distancing) because when that occurs, that's when days stall out a lot, you get lots of small pocket 'townblocks' and the game becomes very hard to decipher bc connections are not clear (in other words, the bussing/distancing is working right now based on how distrustful/argumentative we all are).<br><br>I don't really have much trust of anyone in this game so far, sadly - because normally townhunting is a huge part of my repertoire and in some games I've torn multiple L-1 wagons on town. But the players in this game aren't towntelling, I'm having a hard time actually finding town motivation in anyone's posts and I can only assume it's because I'm struggling to see through people's (perhaps justified) antagonism towards me."}

Still, that makes transcend!scum seem a lot more plausible to me if RB is town (which was my thought for basically the entirety of d1, and which I'm still kind of hoping is the case); it's too much of a stretch fmpov for them to both be scum at once, and I think they can read each other better than I can read either of them.<br><br>Digressions aside, doesn't the fact that you're having so much trouble getting townreads fit <span style=\"font-style: italic\">better</span> with the possibility that a lot of the absentees are town? <br><br>What exactly makes dunker scummy here?

A few people seem to have boon sitting in their scumreads (or I misread/forgot what reads were) but the only votecount where he hit 3 votes was on d1, and projectmatt has never had more than 2 at once (in a VC). They've been consistently voting each other while transcend/dunker wagons formed, so if they WERE tvt, those wagons would literally have to have scum on them at this point in time fmpov (and from everyone else's unless they think the team is exactly me, nicol, and rb). Maybe that last part doesn't mean much, but I think the fact that RB is the only one besides them voting either of them should mean something to the people who have strong townreads on RB (which is, I believe, most of the players who have been active today?)."}

On the other hand, I -do- think gdp is most likely town (and have thought this for most of the game so far, with like the sole exception of his very first post d1) and he seems to genuinely believe dunker's scum, and I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">know</span> I townread tone too easily -- especially dumbtells. <br><br>Which could be the case with nicol but I just doubt it. It's not that I would be  townreading her over the other players in the game over here if it came down to a cc, or that I plan to let her coast for the rest of the game if I see a scumtell/she really continues to do nothing all game, but from my point of view she hasn't scumtold much yet and has been mostly absent. I've said this a couple times above, but I don't think absence on its own is a scumtell -- even if it's antitown and one might wish it were. (I was mostly absent for a couple stretches of time so far, too, and TRs faded -- which made sense -- but people also sort of drifted towards scumleaning me because it was easier and I had no input with which to counteract that; similarly, gerry and nicol have a lot of people asking for input and a few people scumreading them now, and I seriously doubt it's going to prove a sustainable strategy if they're mafia.) <br><br>I don't know if I empathize with myself anymore but I do remember thinking nicol was extremely towny when I first read her posts, before hearing what anyone else had to say; the fact that other people who know her better than I do also seem to be more-or-less complacent with her just makes me less concerned. <br><br>I believe she's considered a fairly easy read when she actually plays the game, which she hasn't been doing for the most part, so I could be wrong. I felt like her attitude from the outset was towny and have seen basically nothing since then. It'd be too good to be true for her to be the mafia this game.  If I feel there's specific evidence to the contrary, or she doesn't change her activity level at some point, I'll probably be more inclined to reconsider that.<br><br>Hope that made more sense."}

Both are experienced mafia players and I'm sure they're capable of towntelling as scum; they've also been largely ignored by the majority of the table, with only creature brushing it off as town v town while others just seem to be avoiding them. I was hoping pjm would come back and post more sometime today but it looks like he hasn't gotten around to it yet. Cloud seemed like an obvtown slot before he subbed out, and flairs brought up a good point when she brought attention to the speech tic boon seems to have developed with \"haha\" and \"lol\" in odd places in a lot of his posts, which makes me wonder if he just talks like that in general or if it's a nervous habit. People laugh in real life when they're under stress, anyway, and tend to use more filler words. Town can be nervous, but that's not the image he's projecting, so maybe flairs has a point there after all. I dunno."}

Your confidence in your reads on transcend/boon is a little hard to empathize with and is especially odd considering you claimed to have only played one game on this site, so if that's true you're very self-assured as either alignment, all things considering. You've had a couple lines that seem to show a focus on yourself and how people perceive you and I guess those weren't there so much in the other game. You reacted much more casually to being fosed in the one linked.<br><br>I'm still really unsure about it and it's a little bit PoE for me."}

Maybe he would have no problem with it, so again, I'm not sure if he's town.

I've actually been visibly flipflopping on both a lot. I just said there was a scum in you/pjm and it was weird that people were ignoring that, which again, doesn't make sense as a \"setup\" of any kind. I mean, you yourself said dunker was less of a threat than PJM in the world where they're scum together. So again I'd like to ask how you thought I was setting up -- even though you seem to have mostly backed down from that stance now. You said your only reasons for scumreading me were poe and logic though, so what made it logical enough for me to be doing whatever I was doing (aka basically nothing, being a useless filler NPC) as scum for you to base a read on it in the next few posts?<br><br>Maybe I wasn't voting dunker and was voting you, but I had been pushing that one of you was scum for a long time before that and had been waiting to vote till pjm came back (which I think I stated in the post where I voted you, so I doubt you missed that completely). No matter what it was doing, it would be drawing attention to you and PJM. I could easily have just voted transcend at the time instead, since I think that was the second-top wagon for a while.<br><br>I basically flipped the moment you responded to it, and onto dunker (who you acknowledged would be less of a threat to town if he were scum than pjm would) who was already being voted by other people -- many of whom were active and posting at the time. <span class=\"noboldsig\">What about that didn't seem scum-motivated, and why was the stuff right before that different?</span><br><br>(Also would still love to hear some about how you can be so confident about dunker and pjm being scum together. &gt;-&lt; ) <br><br>Predit: o okay I see you answered the part about the dunker vote. <br><br>I think GDP was part of the conversation at that point, so if I were scum with dunker, i'd have to justify not voting him despite what GDP was asking me to read, and if I knew he was scum that'd mean either avoiding the point with 'eh i don't see anything' and possibly looking pretty bad in GDP's eyes or argue something i didn't believe while knowing dunker was my partner. That'd be awkward, and on top of it, you were shouting not to lynch transcend so I had no excuse to vote him over you if I were moving my vote for the sake of alleviating pressure. I could have gone on PJM and indeed I mentioned considering that! but there would be a risk of rb and someone else stacking their votes on as well and then the wagon gaining traction.<br><br>All that, or I could have just not been thinking about it strategically. I'm hardly a good or quick-thinking player and I think I hardly come off as such.<br><br>I guess I get how it could be towny but I'm still not so sure about how it was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">compared to </span>the part you scumread me for a couple posts prior."}

I'll go check if it's normal for you to do as town but right now it feels like you're squirming out of any accountability for your read. It also reminds me of what I feel scum tend to do in EM games when asked to give reads; instead of saying \"this person's scummy because they did this and it seems scum\" they like to justify their reads by either talking about why the person is doing something they dislike, emotionally, or just listing something like \"lurking\" as a reason that they didn't come up with in that one game, and therefore didn't have to actually consider the specific person's *alignment* to come up with. I don't know if this sounds coherent or not, but my point is that you did both of these things in your explanation that resemble this. </div></blockquote>Sorry if I got this wrong, but didn't I list 2 things that rb had done that seemed scum to me, which was one of the things you listed as townie? This paragraph just seems kinda contradictory to me- if you want to expand/argue against that might be a bit helpful.<br><br>I think cloudkicker makes a lot of claims but doesn't really give much explanation for them (ex. posts 65, 152, 153) which almost feels townie, as if he doesn't need to explain himself because he knows it's right, which I don't like but also don't think scum would do. Going to look into them more tomorrow morning after sleep.<br><br>Also sorry but what was rb's question? I don't see him asking me anywhere prior to this post?<br><blockquote><div><cite>rb wrote:</cite>So flairs, how is a) arguing we shouldn't try hard as opposed to, \"I think I've found scum but won't agonize over it and drag out the day and demotivate everyone\"?</div></blockquote>Uh it feels like something scum would do- we've got two weeks for day 1 and scum would probably want to lynch a townie the first chance they got so that there's less a chance of one of them being lynched. So if you were scum you'd be trying to push a town lynch early in the game.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>rb wrote:</cite>b) same question as to myko, since this is basically just the same thing myko said - how does one respond to an accusation about their meta without clarifying their meta?<br><br>I didn't go out of my way to pre-explain myself as having high toxicity as town and then going and being toxic. Myko brought it up. Also, my wiki page has been like that for much longer than I've had my role PM for this game, so again - how is that relevant to my alignment here?</div></blockquote>Well see that's the point, the fact that you have these preset definitions and expectations means you know what people are looking for when they look for town!rb, so you would have the abity to act the way town!rb would and have some sort of higher authority back you up on the fact that you're \"town\" when really you're scum (sorry dense sentance just tell me if I need to clarify)<br>Alao, you wouldn't have to respond to accusations about your meta if you didn't try to defend yourself with it in the first place.</div></blockquote> I think this is towny and the reasoning makes sense lol. 10/10 pro scumhunter here</div></blockquote><br>i think it was this.<br><br>admittedly not surewhy i was so convinced when i originally saw her posts. <br><br>regardless, this is what i was referring to. there's not much else to go off of. i think it had to do with her mind being on how good she was at scumhunting rather than how towny she looked which was maybe not a good read but refer back to what i said earlier and the fact that she hasn't been here."}

For the showiness behind \"rb could carry the game,\" Transcend's approach to a couple rb's reads are shockingly flat.  The most striking examples of what I'm talking about are Impoetic and gerryoat.  rb has now unequivocally said three times that <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9363713#p9363713\" class=\"postlink\">he's</a> <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9367910#p9367910\" class=\"postlink\">townreading</a> <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9368008#p9368008\" class=\"postlink\">Impoetic</a>.  Not only is Transcend currently voting her, he's also not bothered to ask rb about why he's townreading her.  There's also the gerryoat read.  gerry is apparently one of Transcend's top townreads since pretty much the beginning of the game, yet when rb said he wasn't <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9365031#p9365031\" class=\"postlink\">confident about gerry being town</a> Transcend did not bother to explain why gerry's place on his townreads was secure.  In summary, I would expect a lot more of an effort on Transcend's part to synchronize reads for all his talk about how great he thinks rb is.  The lack of it makes me think it's all lip service.</div></blockquote><br>I actually thought transcend voting me around that time was really contradictory and weird for a few concrete reasons, iirc, but then he unvoted and said it had been a reaction test... right?<br><br>As for the interactions with rb, that might be a good point, and thank you for detailing this so thoroughly with the links to posts and everything ^^"}

Projectmatt also stated he would be willing to vote transcend if he couldn't get a dunker lynch. Dunker was on transcend's and said in the same post he moved his vote that it was for the sake of encouraging Gerry to talk, which was like a second ago. I moved my vote for the same reason, just didn't plan to admit it and moved it back to transcend when it ended up being obvious."}

It's like he chooses his words to come off as town as possible, but I don't see any substance/sincere thought process/realness in any of his reads/actions.<br><br>The idea of his posts being performative/serving the agenda to dissapiate any suspicion on him is even clearer to me because of what happened about 50 pages ago, when I outed a scumread on Boon for acting weird/inconsistent with his reads, and his response was to snarkily talk to me about how I was obviously misreading him because my meta on him was wrong. The situation had nothing to do with his meta at all - and I've noticed that he's used \"it's just my meta\" as a fallback quite often this game to excuse any of his actual shortcomings.<br><br>Another really good example of this is the way that he's flip-flopped on Impoetic, with him scumreading/not scumreading her seemingly based solely on how Impoetic is reading him. I seriously can not see a logical thought process behind the way Boon has flip-flopped on Impoetic, and he's outright shown that the only reason he is switching is dependent on how Impoetic reads him.<br><br><br>There's so many posts like this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9421196#p9421196\" class=\"postlink\">post 2695</a>, Boonskiies wrote:</cite>Like, I still think you're the JK, tbh.

Why the hell would you out your JK read? Even if you thought that Impoetic was the power role trying to hide, why would you specifically bring that to the attention of every single player in this game?<br><br>Another note: When he gets scumread, he replies with this snarky, \"lmao this is so silly  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\">\" attitude that I also have a habit of doing as scum, which is basically a way to make your opponent look stupid without actually addressing any of his points.<br><br>I would be able to forgive all of this if his play today hasn't been so absurd. He's extremely, incredibly confident in his own scumreads, but his reasoning for them is incredibly shallow. It's really rare that I see someone who can claim with 100% confidence that he knows the scumteam, especially when their reads are based on very little substance.<br><br>I really just think he's likely to be mafia."}

And you talked to me about being confident about scum; you are doing the exact same thing with me, the only difference is you are scum pushing for a mislynch, which is why you completely perspective slipped with that when you stated what town would be like that. You are scum. Nail in the coffin. Caught out.</div></blockquote><br><br>Wow, what a terrible post. I can't believe how completely delusional this sounds. I just outlined a bunch of reasons as to why I think you're scum, and you literally pulled a: \"you have literally nothing\". Just because you want something to be true doesn't mean that it is.<br><br>What about your scumtell that I called out earlier this game, and you excusing it with \"meta\" that didn't make sense for the situation? That seems like a blatant scumtell to me.<br><br>What about your wishy-washy read on Impoetic that changes every time Impoetic changes her own read on you? Why haven't you explained your thought process about that?<br><br>What about you outing your jailkeeper read for the entire game to read for no reason?<br><br>What about your incredibly confident reads with no substance behind them? It doesn't matter if you're a big-ego player - having 100% confidence with no reasoning isn't something that any good town player would do.<br><br>And sure, you can chalk up some of these things to personality traits - but that's why I'm ASKING YOU to show me examples in other games where those personality traits are similar. I'm asking you to explain what I find bad about you, but you're hiding behind a \"no, you!\" defense."}

The situation had nothing to do with his meta at all - and I've noticed that he's used \"it's just my meta\" as a fallback quite often this game to excuse any of his actual shortcomings.<br><br>Another really good example of this is the way that he's flip-flopped on Impoetic, with him scumreading/not scumreading her seemingly based solely on how Impoetic is reading him. I seriously can not see a logical thought process behind the way Boon has flip-flopped on Impoetic, and he's outright shown that the only reason he is switching is dependent on how Impoetic reads him.<br><br><br>There's so many posts like this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9421196#p9421196\" class=\"postlink\">post 2695</a>, Boonskiies wrote:</cite>Like, I still think you're the JK, tbh.

Why the hell would you out your JK read? Even if you thought that Impoetic was the power role trying to hide, why would you specifically bring that to the attention of every single player in this game?<br><br>Another note: When he gets scumread, he replies with this snarky, \"lmao this is so silly  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\">\" attitude that I also have a habit of doing as scum, which is basically a way to make your opponent look stupid without actually addressing any of his points.<br><br>I would be able to forgive all of this if his play today hasn't been so absurd. He's extremely, incredibly confident in his own scumreads, but his reasoning for them is incredibly shallow.

Nicol's vote on the mykonian wagon was terrible and not just in a surface-level kind of way. So, he's been pretty set on wanting her lynched. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9395568#p9395568\">2050</a>, he switches to Dunker based on meta and starts pushing that read. So, when I come in and townread Dunker, from his POV, his two scumreads are defending each other. So, I can see him doubling down there. I can also see him thinking that I'm either scum defending a partner or scum townreading Dunker because I \"know\" he's town so I'd seem like the safer bet. So, yeah I do understand how he came to that conclusion. I'm just not really confident that he's town. I don't think any of that is particularly hard to fake for scum.

But I guess I'll catchup first and post my thought and then see the reaction. It'll probably be more informative.<br><br>Regarding Dunker, I wouldn't have found it suspicious if just said \"better BV than me\" in self-preservation. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9416240#p9416240\">2574</a>, he said he didn't find my predecessor suspicious.

The situation had nothing to do with his meta at all - and I've noticed that he's used \"it's just my meta\" as a fallback quite often this game to excuse any of his actual shortcomings.<br><br>Another really good example of this is the way that he's flip-flopped on Impoetic, with him scumreading/not scumreading her seemingly based solely on how Impoetic is reading him.

Why the hell would you out your JK read?

I've only played two games with her but my impression is that she prefers playing scum over town. If that's true, it might point towards Boon being town. I'm still not impressed by any of her posting though and trying to derail the rb wagon is the kind of thing she does as scum. I don't really understand the Impoetic scumread either.<br><br>Also, I retract my concerns about TellTaleHeart. I re-read again and TwoFace really seems to have been so emotionally invested in getting rb lynched and then replacing out when he doesn't get his way. I just can't see that coming from scum. <br><br>@Impoetic, you said you were townreading Nicol very, very early on in the game. Can you point out what posts gave you this impression? Do you still feel that MariaR/Boon slot is town for MariaR's attack on you early game?<br><br>I'm on page 30 around the point where all the replacements happened. Updated reads are Creature, Transcend, rb, Impoetic, TellTale town. I'm going to read projectmatt more closely and talk about him. I've pretty much blank on his predecessor (Cloud). That still leaves Graphic, Boon, Dunker, Gerryoat that I'd be okay with lynching. I'll get back to the rest of it after coming back from work tonight."}

I think Dunkerdoodles is the most likely of the viable lynches to flip scum here. A few main reasons:<br><br>First off, his play in this game revolved around just a Transcend/Boon scumteam and he's been pretty much repeating the same thing over and over and calling them partners. My problem with this is that I don't see any logical reason why he thinks this other than Transcend pushing him for being \"an easy mislynch.\" Then he just threw the Boon read out there and called him a Transcend partner.<br><br>Then, take a look at his scumread/vote on me. He just out-of-nowhere says I could be Transcend and Boon's third partner because my slot was apparently scumread. Yet, the time at which he votes me is when my wagon is picking up. This shows that even with all his talk about how he's willing to get lynched to prove that Transcend/Boon are scum, he's happy to take the easy out for self-survival which doesn't match up with his words. After the wagon dissipates, he calls it a reaction test and moves on to trying to convince me that Boon is scum. I don't buy the vote was a reaction test because he said in his previous post that he was scumreading me.<br><br>Finally, his meta. He seems a LOT more confident and self-assured in himself than he did in the towngame I played with him. Normally this points to town which is why I asked him which alignment he prefers. The fact that he prefers playing scum explains so much: why he's so confident in his reads and feeling like he's enjoying himself whereas his towngame was marked by a lot of genuine uncertainty. I see him re-iterating that Transcend and Boon are scum at every opportunity but I don't see him really trying to sort anyone nor do I think his level of confidence matches up with the reasons he's using to scumread them.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Dunkerdoodles</span><br><br>We don't have the numbers for GraphicDesignPassion.

Nicol's vote on the mykonian wagon was terrible and not just in a surface-level kind of way. So, he's been pretty set on wanting her lynched. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9395568#p9395568\">2050</a>, he switches to Dunker based on meta and starts pushing that read. So, when I come in and townread Dunker, from his POV, his two scumreads are defending each other. So, I can see him doubling down there. I can also see him thinking that I'm either scum defending a partner or scum townreading Dunker because I \"know\" he's town so I'd seem like the safer bet. So, yeah I do understand how he came to that conclusion. I'm just not really confident that he's town. I don't think any of that is particularly hard to fake for scum. But this game has been pretty hard to get reads out of. Lots of playstyles that I find extremely difficult to read (the \"EM\" style).<br><br>I'm going to come back to Transcend after I catch up more.<br><br>Regarding TellTaleHeart, she voted me after I said that I was compiling a catchup post so it should have been obvious then that I hadn't finished catching up and her reason to scumread me was premature. But I guess I'll catchup first and post my thought and then see the reaction. It'll probably be more informative.<br><br>Regarding Dunker, I wouldn't have found it suspicious if just said \"better BV than me\" in self-preservation. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9416240#p9416240\">2574</a>, he said he didn't find my predecessor suspicious. His scumreads were Transcend, Creature, and Boon. Then he just hopped on the wagon started by BOTH his scumreads Transcend and Creature. I also found the \"BV could be scum with Transcend and Boon\" comment scummy because it seemed like such a throwaway comment with no real conviction.

I think Dunkerdoodles is the most likely of the viable lynches to flip scum here. A few main reasons:<br><br>First off, his play in this game revolved around just a Transcend/Boon scumteam and he's been pretty much repeating the same thing over and over and calling them partners. My problem with this is that I don't see any logical reason why he thinks this other than Transcend pushing him for being \"an easy mislynch.\" Then he just threw the Boon read out there and called him a Transcend partner.<br><br>Then, take a look at his scumread/vote on me. He just out-of-nowhere says I could be Transcend and Boon's third partner because my slot was apparently scumread. Yet, the time at which he votes me is when my wagon is picking up. This shows that even with all his talk about how he's willing to get lynched to prove that Transcend/Boon are scum, he's happy to take the easy out for self-survival which doesn't match up with his words. After the wagon dissipates, he calls it a reaction test and moves on to trying to convince me that Boon is scum. I don't buy the vote was a reaction test because he said in his previous post that he was scumreading me.<br><br>Finally, his meta. He seems a LOT more confident and self-assured in himself than he did in the towngame I played with him. Normally this points to town which is why I asked him which alignment he prefers. The fact that he prefers playing scum explains so much: why he's so confident in his reads and feeling like he's enjoying himself whereas his towngame was marked by a lot of genuine uncertainty. I see him re-iterating that Transcend and Boon are scum at every opportunity but I don't see him really trying to sort anyone nor do I think his level of confidence matches up with the reasons he's using to scumread them.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Dunkerdoodles</span><br><br>We don't have the numbers for GraphicDesignPassion. I think this is our best play here.</div></blockquote><br>This is REALLY reassuring. TBH I never really metadived dunker beyond barely skimming part of his iso one game, making it too hard to process anything he was saying that way for it to stick with me"}

Here's what I found most odd from Dunker's posting. He's very, very sure that Transcend and Boon are not only scum, but also partners. It's weird logic for town to have. It's weird logic for even scum to have especially if Transcend and Boon are both town. I think ruling them both out for the Dunker push would be a fatal mistake. I liked Transcend's posts towards the end of the day and it felt like he was genuinely gamesolving. I'm suspicious of Boon. Dunker mostly pushed on Transcend and just threw Boon in there as a \"Transcend partner\" for some weird reason and went so far as to say he'd happily die if they flipped town. Boon for his part did the same but also had this weird logic that if Transcend was town, then he, Boon was also town.<br><br>I've caught up on most of D1 but haven't yet read how projectmatt treated Dunker. I did think his entrance and push on Boon was town. His frustration with rb looked genuine.<br><br>I think scum more likely than not bussed. I'd expect more resistance and pushes onto me or projectmatt if scum didn't want to bus.<br><br>Here's where I'm at readswise. Besides Flairs, TellTaleHeart and Creature are the only ones I have as unconditionally town. Pretty much everyone else I have to look over.<br><br>@Transcend, you said you voted me to see what happens and \"scumfuck heaven\" poured onto me. Who were these people besides Dunker? Creature was voting me and we agree he's town. Graphic, TellTale, and Dunker voted after you. You said Graphic was town and TellTale was town. So, who were the scummy people? Can you also explain your read on Boonskiies?"}

Your post seemed like you voted because Boonskiies asked you to but you never state a townread on Boonskiies and even if you townread him, why would you sheep him? It was four days to deadline so there was still time to \"get some slight understanding of what's going on in the game\" before you made a decision.<br><br>@Transcend - you told TellTaleHeart not to ever rule you out as being scum partners with anyone else because you can do all sorts of weird stuff.

If jailer goes for a scumread and gets it right, it pretty much doesn't matter who mafia targets; if jailer tries to go on cop and mafia hits a townread/jailer read, cop remains alive w/o a report and mafia has a high chance of killing an unclear. As it is, they were gambling on jailer aiming for mafia, which obviously seems more appealing from jailer's perspective unless jailer is really confident mafia is aiming for cop, and idk how anyone is supposed to be certain about that. Not killing gives town another mislynch, and killing a town is still risking autoloss, both by cop reports and jailer actions. Besides, mafia is in a bad enough position to be more inclined to gamble, don't you think?"}

I'm just not confident he'll flip scum. My impression of him (and most epicmafia players) is that he cares a lot more about winning as scum than as town. All he's done this game is pop up at random times and call Transcend scum. If he's scum, he'd surely know that he's never going to achieve a lynch there with the way he's going about it. He'd also know that he'd have to contribute at least <span style=\"font-style: italic\">something</span> if he hopes to win. His choice of target also seems weird. Early D2, Transcend started celebrating about how he was responsible for the Dunker lynch and then Gerry shows up and continues calling Transcend scum. I also think Gerry would position himself better with respect to the Dunker lynch but he hasn't really implied a scumread there or tried to look good from it. I'm just annoyed that instead of replacing out of a game he has no interest in playing, he is trying to get lynched."}

I worked most of the day yesterday and all day today. Here are some thoughts:<br><br>Dunker's posts honestly do kind of point toward Gerry possibly being scum. In particular, from #2526 from #2564, Dunker put a \"pressure\" vote on Gerry and then backed off incredibly quickly, citing him as \"not a viable lynch\". <br><br>He said this in his reads list:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9416240#p9416240\" class=\"postlink\">post 2574</a>, Dunkerdoodles wrote:</cite>7. gerry uh basically lurks and prodges which is ok i guess. i don't think he's bussing transcend so if transcend flips red he's probably town and visa versa. i thought he was scum earlier but i kinda don't think so anymore.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>which is exactly how I would expect scumDunker to treat Gerry - basically a \"null idk maybe scum\" read.<br><br>Re: Transcend<br><br>Honestly, the only viable candiate I can figure out for scum is likely to be Transcend, there's this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9421481#p9421481\" class=\"postlink\">post 2764</a>, Dunkerdoodles wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9421475#p9421475\" class=\"postlink\">post 2759</a>, Boonskiies wrote:</cite>you guys most likely can't kill anybody this game without risking a guilty or another conf town, so you're fucked anyways.</div></blockquote><br><br>ok then, we lynch transcend. when he flips scum, we powerlynch you tommorrow. if he flips town (which he won't) you get your lynches in pjm and I<br><br>deal or no deal?</div></blockquote><br><br>along with that, the last few posts before Dunker got lynched are sort of telling - he was riding really, really hard on getting Transcend lynched, in a way that honestly makes me feel like it was a \"lynch my scum buddy to save myself\" sort of gambit<br><br>Along with that, I might have been wrong about my read on Graphic. Dunker's interactions with him are actually really hard to paint as a scumteam - in particular, Dunker townread Graphic really hardcore and defended him through most of the game. I'm almost positive that a somewhat new player like Dunker wouldn't try to buddy his partner so hard and so obviously. It doesn't seem likely to me.<br><br>I think BlackVoid and Impoetic are town.<br><br>If I'm being honest, I did a readthrough of Creature's ISO and it honestly pings incredibly, hilariously null to me - but I can kind of cautiously townread him partially because he sincerely thought that me and Boon were T v T, and I find it hard to believe that a scum wouldn't try to jump on a fight like that and instead withdraw completely. I think calling them scum would be a big case of overthinking, TBH.<br><br>Anyway, I really can't see a feasible end to this game that doesn't involve one of Gerry/Transcend being scum, and I'm comfortable with Transcend being jailed if Gerry would somehow flip town.

I think Boon was trying to set up a projectmatt mislynch based on a Dunker scumflip. He did the same to me (actually both Dunker and Boon insisted that I was scum with the other) and I was just bemused at what was happening but then concluded that a Dunker/Boon team was likely. Projectmatt sort of had a similar reaction in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9401225#p9401225\">2221</a>. He noticed the weirdness in Boon pushing Dunker and setting him up as the next lynch. Also, what I said about Dunker just freely associating himself with Projectmatt. See the \"<span style=\"font-style: italic\">they already have 2 easy mislynches they've been setting up this whole time, in me and project</span>\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9425828#p9425828\">2893</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9426539#p9426539\">2984</a>.<br><br>Projectmatt townread basically comes down to three main reasons:<br>1. Boon's posting: Boon linked him to Dunker pretty hard and tried to set him up as the next lynch.<br>2. Dunker's posting: Dunker propagated this theory and enthusiastically accepted the idea that him and projectmatt were the same alignment by often tying himself to Projectmatt on three separate occasions.<br>3. Projectmatt's posting: Confusion about what Boon and Dunker were doing and reacting pretty similarly to how I did when Boon kept pushing that he and Dunker were partners.<br><br>I'm town and I'm confident Creature is town so it pretty much has to be GraphicDesign.<br><br>I don't have a slam-dunk case on him. But I think for someone who considers himself instrumental in the Dunker lynch, he really lost motivation to play after Boon was guiltied. He basically stopped gamesolving and despite suspecting Creature, suddenly changed his tune and started to \"suspect\" gerryoat and projectmatt - the two most likely lynches at the time. Throught the game, he's been very much in the background and I don't find his Dunker meta-case particularly convincing. I thought it was actually pretty weak.

You already know the answer to this, are you seriously going to make me go back and quote the past few pages of our interactions? You've been going for attacks that don't have much logic or context in them at all..in particular, you accused me just now of not being able to pinpoint BV's towntells when in a post I made yesterday, I specifically quoted a post by BV that I thought was town. That makes me think that you're not reading things fully or taking them into context.<br><br>2. I mean, mafia going for a push while either ignoring the context or just not reading it is pretty common.<br><br>3. A question like this is exactly what makes me scumread you. It's really slimy and arguing over semantics to ask me why I said I'm \"leaning\" you being scum instead of \"I think you're scum\". Do you understand where my issue is coming from with this? What purpose does this question serve?</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't know the answer.  I am confused and trying to process 13 players and a shit ton of information at once.  Please show me. <br><br>2.  Why would I do that though?  Why woulden't I read the context?<br><br>3.  It serves a purpose because I want to know why you were so unsure of me being scum, if you thought blackvoid was 100% town and creature was town.</div></blockquote><br><br>Okay, well I just showed you an example of how I feel like you aren't reading the context of things. Another one is the one of the first posts I pointed out, where you asked me why I was surprised Transcend didn't TR me, when the rest of my post was an answer to that question. Another example is you asking me what town things BV has done while quoting a post that explains the very question you're asking.<br><br>2. Well, it's clear to me that you haven't read the context for a lot of what you're saying. This is something that I can know to be true since you're just now catching up on the game. It's hard for me to say why specifically you would take that route as scum, but it also doesn't make sense to do as town. It would be anti-town to try to confidently find the mafia in a game where you've only read a couple of pages, which is why it's scummy to do that. Do you get it?<br><br>3. But the wording of the question is really leading. You took me saying \"I'm already leaning on Graphic being scum\" to mean something that it didn't mean at all. At least from my perspective, it looks like you're trying to argue over semantics ex:\"why did you say this instead of this?\" when the specific wording doesn't matter.<br><br>I don't think I missed any questions."}

Flips aside it's DRASTICALLY higher chance for wolves to keep a vote on the same person for an extended period of time</div></blockquote><br><br>his reasoning is that the vca paints me as scum because i kept a vote on boon for a long period of time. i don't think \"scum always votes one person\" is a universal tell in any form, and i think using that tell without the context of the game is dangerous. <br><br>if he wanted to paint nicol/blackvoid as scum, he could just as easily say \"mafia are usually too afraid to vote\", and then call out blackvoid/nicol for not voting for the majority of D2. <br><br>or, if he wanted to paint creature as scum, he could say \"scum usually try to protect their partner from being lynched\", and then call out creature for jumping on the BV wagon when dunker was getting lynched.<br><br>my point is that VCA is an extremely easy thing to manipulate/use to suit your own agenda, and i feel like it's exactly what he is doing here. <br><br>also there's fucking this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9485411#p9485411\" class=\"postlink\">post 4269</a>, Mulch wrote:</cite>This mug accusing me of doing convienient reads when I just did VCA and did vote analysis</div></blockquote><br><br>trying to say \"my reads come from a sincere place because i did VCA\" is transparently just not true. <br><br>w/e im tired of trying to explain this"}

Dunker never seemed uncomfortable with this idea. He was very happy to keep pushing the idea that he and Projectmatt were the same alignment. Boon similarly did this with Transcend going so far as to suggest lynching Transcend to confirm him. Dunker and Boon set themselves on opposite sides. Dunker pushed the Boon/Transcend scumteam theory while Boon pushed the Dunker/project theory.<br><br>The more I think about this, the more confident I am that Projectmatt can't be scum here. It's obviously not Creature. It literally can't be anyone besides Mulch/Graphic's slot.<br><br>Nothing Mulch posted has given me any pause. He needs to get me and Project lynched to win which is exactly how he's positioning himself. He is pushing project for dumb and nonsensical reasoning like why project asked me and Transcend for our reads on Creature. That's pretty obvious. If Projectmatt hasn't played with Creature, it's fairly reasonable that he wouldn't understand my and Transcend's ridiculously confident townreads there. Pretty confident game ends with a Mulch lynch.<br><br>@Transcend, there's an absolute shit-ton of stuff and interactions from Boon and Dunker that clears me and if I have to go through all of that stuff, I will. As for Projectmatt, I don't know how better to explain my townread there. If you still think there's a possibility he's scum, talk to me about it because I find the evidence clearing him off of being a Dunker/Boon partner to be very, very strong. Lynching both me and Projectmatt would be worst possible think you can do here since I'm close to about 99% confident Mulch is scum."}

I think Boon was trying to set up a projectmatt mislynch based on a Dunker scumflip. He did the same to me (actually both Dunker and Boon insisted that I was scum with the other) and I was just bemused at what was happening but then concluded that a Dunker/Boon team was likely. Projectmatt sort of had a similar reaction in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9401225#p9401225\">2221</a>. He noticed the weirdness in Boon pushing Dunker and setting him up as the next lynch. Also, what I said about Dunker just freely associating himself with Projectmatt. See the \"<span style=\"font-style: italic\">they already have 2 easy mislynches they've been setting up this whole time, in me and project</span>\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9425828#p9425828\">2893</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9426539#p9426539\">2984</a>.<br><br>Projectmatt townread basically comes down to three main reasons:<br>1. Boon's posting: Boon linked him to Dunker pretty hard and tried to set him up as the next lynch.<br>2. Dunker's posting: Dunker propagated this theory and enthusiastically accepted the idea that him and projectmatt were the same alignment by often tying himself to Projectmatt on three separate occasions.<br>3. Projectmatt's posting: Confusion about what Boon and Dunker were doing and reacting pretty similarly to how I did when Boon kept pushing that he and Dunker were partners.<br><br>I'm town and I'm confident Creature is town so it pretty much has to be GraphicDesign.<br><br>I don't have a slam-dunk case on him. But I think for someone who considers himself instrumental in the Dunker lynch, he really lost motivation to play after Boon was guiltied. He basically stopped gamesolving and despite suspecting Creature, suddenly changed his tune and started to \"suspect\" gerryoat and projectmatt - the two most likely lynches at the time. Throught the game, he's been very much in the background and I don't find his Dunker meta-case particularly convincing. I thought it was actually pretty weak. Despite his level of conviction in the Dunker being scum, he was happy to hop onto my wagon even though he said I'm not likely to be partners with Dunker. When the momentum swung back to Dunker, he hopped back onto the wagon.</div></blockquote>This is a good point, though. I'd be surprised if this were partner interaction between dunker/pjm. meh."}

I just want the game to end today and I feel really, really strongly about projectmatt being town. Neither of you have addressed my three separate reasons for townreading him: 1) Boon setting him up to be lynched upon a Dunker flip (Boon did the same to me and it makes a fuckton more sense for Boon to set up a townie than a buddy). Mulch countered this with vague assertions about me not knowing how Boon thinks which he CANNOT back up despite being asked twice. 2) Dunker acting like he and pjm were the same alignment which is the EXACT same thing that Boon was doing with you (Transcend). They set themselves up on opposite sides and tied two townies to each other. Their plan is blatantly obvious. 3) Projectmatt's own reaction to them mirrored mine. He wonders what the heck is going on, then speculates that it could be a Boon/Dunker team. <br><br>I don't want to lynch a townread and give Mulch another shot at escaping the lynch. Graphic Design has been super low key and had some scummy moments (the Creature scumread mysteriously disappearing after I told him Creature was town through meta). You were so, so sure that Gerry was scum and I just caved in and let you have the lynch. If you think I'm town either way, trust me on this and lynch Mulch. Or at the very least acknowledge my towncase on Matt because I think it's airtight and I really don't want this to get to lylo. Still 99% confident game ends with a Mulch lynch."}

Dunker has been pretty blatant about projectmatt being a mislynch. His line is pretty much \"Transcend and Boon are scum mislynching me and projectmatt.\" But it seemed pretty one-sided. Projectmatt for his part suspected Dunker but then backed off at the last moment when it seemed like a Dunker lynch was going to happen. If he was committed to bussing Dunker, why would he make a post like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9419724#p9419724\">2653</a>?

After replacing in, I saw Dunker under pressure, thought his initial conviction that Transcend/Boon were scum to be rather aggressive for newb-scum so thought he was town. But upon a closer look, his reads didn't actually make any sense. He also opportunistically hopped onto my wagon despite mislynching me before when we were both town. That clued me into the fact that he was likely scum. Then Boon showed up, completely twisted what I was writing and said my interaction with Dunker was SvS. Dunker said the same but with Boon claiming that I was Transcend/Boon's third partner. That's what alerted me to the fact that it could actually be Boon/Dunker. I correctly came to that conclusion, made a case on Dunker and pushed for his lynch. Next day, I followed up on my Boon scumread and defended projectmatt because it looked like Boon was setting him up. I was proven right again when Boon was guiltied. So far so good. Biggest error I made was probably to townread projectmatt based off the interactions. That led to paranoia of Transcend, compromising on a Gerryoat lynch that I didn't believe in, and tunneling Graphic's/Mulch's slot. After seeing all the flips, it became apparent that I was wrong since it's just between you and Project and I don't see any possibility of you being scum.<br><br>Some things that pointed towards projectmatt that I shouldn't have ignored:<br>1. rb kill. rb was the only one who had pegged BOTH Boon and Projectmatt as scum pre-flips so killing him before cross-bussing made a lot of sense.<br>2. projectmatt had inside info. He was setting up people to be Boonslot's partners right from his very first post:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9373407#p9373407\" class=\"postlink\">post 785</a>, projectmatt wrote:</cite>still think maria might be scum based on #590 and the stuff before it, and transcend lightly scumreading them but backing off reads like a weird partner tell, if they would be that obvious?</div></blockquote><br>Also, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9375797#p9375797\">862</a> is pretty big stretch to make it look like Transcend was a Boon partner.<br><br>I should have just combed through his ISO to see how he did all this but with the Munch guy's spamfest, I was spending way too much energy trying to drive his lynch through rather than reanalyzing but that's just the kind of playstyle that's hard to deal with for me."}

If I went solely off of who played the better game reads-wise, then I would suspect Creature - especially because his ISO shows him being really noncommittal toward lynching Boon/Dunker/trying to divert the lynch to Graphic on d2. For the last hour or so of writing, Creature being scum is actually exactly where I was leaning toward. I spent over an hour gathering quotes and trying to point out to myself how they were scummy, but honestly, it doesn't feel right at all. I just can't call Creature scum in spite of some of rougher parts of his ISO. His overall tone and general manner are really, really towny. <br><br>In particular, the way he's currently treating himself as definitively clear is actually a towntell to me. His last post essentially said \"you two should share your thoughts throughout the game\", as though the game was certainly between me and BV. I don't have the guts as mafia to literally proclaim myself as definitely not being mafia when I'm a non-clear, and that post honestly feels almost like a townslip to me. I wish I could explain that better, but the way I feel about that post are the way that the majority of his posts are making me feel when I read through them.<br><br>From an objective perspective, his posts could easily have scum motivation behind them. In particular, a lot of his posts in the past day have made me really uncomfortable - that's something I can highlight more if anyone is curious - but the tone and the attitude behind them really leads me to believe that they must be coming from town. <br><br>I've always thought that the proper way to play forum mafia was to base reads solely on logical, concrete reasons. Literally earlier in this same game, I said this: <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9403909#p9403909\" class=\"postlink\">post 2269</a>, projectmatt wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9403252#p9403252\" class=\"postlink\">post 2251</a>, Creature wrote:</cite>You mean Boon vs projectmatt?<br><br>idk, do you consider projectmatt experienced? Or is it just because of date of join?</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm experienced in fast-paced mafia games that generally take 20-30 minutes. My approach to those games is based on logic and tone, but they go by so quickly that<span class=\"noboldsig\"> my approach to forum mafia (tries, at least) to be based solely on logic.</span> Forum mafia lets you choose your words so carefully that basing reads on tone doesn't work nearly as well as finding flaws/holes in what people are doing.<br><br>Why are we town v town?</div></blockquote><br><br>But clearly, trying to read games based solely on logic just isn't working out for me. It got me to figure out that Boon was scum, but it definitely hasn't helped me read players like Mulch/BV/Creature. If I approached reading Mulch from a tone/gut perspective instead of a solely logical perspective, I honestly think I could have figured out that he was town, because looking back his tone is so damn towny, but I was so caught up in all the ways that he had made logical errors that I just couldn't believe that he could be town. <br><br>I understand now that a big part of the problem of this game, and probably a reason why I'm gonna get lynched, is because my approach to the entire game has been incorrect. I need to start basing my reads largely on tone/intuition/gut, because trying to catch people logically just doesn't work. People are people, and people are going to make mistakes.<br><br>So, this is a realization that's likely to be too little too late - but it's the best I can do. I think that adding this new approach together with looking at this game with a fresh pair of eyes, BlackVoid is the last mafia here.<br><br>I think this game was set up very well by BoonSkies. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9426628#p9426628\" class=\"postlink\">post 3025</a>, Boonskiies wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9426617#p9426617\" class=\"postlink\">post 3019</a>, BlackVoid wrote:</cite>I still don't get why you are tying yourself to Transcend so hard.

Every post BV/Boon make toward each other aren't exactly strong pushes - but they are calling out each other's flaws in a way that makes me feel like BV likely already had inside information about the game. <br><br>It's kind of like Mulch pointed out here:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9484904#p9484904\" class=\"postlink\">post 4203</a>, Mulch wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9426505#p9426505\" class=\"postlink\">post 2977</a>, BlackVoid wrote:</cite>@Dunker, why do you never vote Boon?

It feels very planned/like it has a specific agenda behind it. My main complaints about BV are the same complaints I essentially had about Boon, but to a lesser extent - his play feels very much like it has an agenda/a plan behind it.<br><br>Some further posts that seem to point to Boon/Dunker/BV setting their interactions up so that BV could use it to clear himself later:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9486333#p9486333\" class=\"postlink\">post 4393</a>, BlackVoid wrote:</cite>@Transcend, read the thread since the point I replaced in and notice how both Dunker and Boon were trying to set me up as being scum with the other.

That's how I figured they were cross-bussing and trying to set me up.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9456450#p9456450\" class=\"postlink\">post 3757</a>, BlackVoid wrote:</cite>So, I'm your next suspect in line after Gerry despite correctly pegging Dunker and Boon and pushing for Dunker's lynch and still pushing Boon after Dunker flipped.<br><br>But I and Creature are being unreasonable for suspecting you of bussing. And TellTale having you as a third? scumread is unreasonable. Why is your stance reasonable and everyone scumreading you being unreasonable?</div></blockquote><br><br>I'll be honest here - one of the reasons I townread BV so hard throughout this game is because he stood up for me, especially yesterday. I understand now that this was likely to be a calculated action - BV lost absolutely nothing by townreading me so hard, but it had the benefit of making me trust him to the extent where I essentially refused to consider the possibility that he was scum.<br><br>Tl;dr: BlackVoid played a nearly perfect game. This is the exact same thing that makes him scum. I'm not gonna lie and say I'm 100% confident about this, but it makes sense to me."}

I know he's a good player as town so him massacring Boon/Dunk doesn't hard indicate he's scum because it was the same way for me. It could be him manipulating information he has, but I don't wanna consider that right now. Besides I ID'd those two as scum as well.<br><br>In terms of the Mulch lynch, that was a scum pushing the lynch of my townread. I'm not really sure who that was because you pushed SO HARD. BlackVoid superseded my judgment when I had voted matt and voted Mulch. Leading to him self voting and then hammering It was extremely infuriating. But meh. Tis what it is. Not sure how I feel about projectmatt making that deal with Mulch.<br><br>I'm at a big giant pile of fucking blah right now. You both look shitty. But in terms of 4666 vs 4670, 4666 seems a lot more genuine to m and less manufactured imo.<br><br>Haven't really been an IC in a LYLO/MYLO position so I'll be taking my time here. Glad I have Creature to aid me."}

I've had points where I played well and points where I played badly. I replaced in and thought Dunker was town because the confident way Dunker pushed Transcend and Boon felt like a newbie that actually believed in his pushes and was getting lynched despite that because he wasn't super good at articulating his reasons. It was only after reading his ISO closely and seeing him vote me opportunistically did I realize he was probably scum.<br><br>Secondly, there was a very good reason that I was able to peg Dunker/Boon as a scumteam.

His BV had absolutely no commitment to it, and seems like he actually doesn't want BV lynched. I think they're trying to make each other come off as TvS, when it's potentially SvS.

That doesn't exonerate me since Boon was setting Projectmatt up too.

What's the logic behind Transcend/Dunker team?</div></blockquote><br><br>My thought process is pretty transparent there. I had two players both of whom did individually scummy things, both of whom were stretching really, really hard to try to tie me up with the other scum so I thought they were both scum together bussing hard trying to lynch me the following day. Projectmatt is just throwing paranoia around claiming it was too good to come from town.<br><br>I didn't play well at all after the Boon lynch I admit. I thought I had very good reasons to read projectmatt as town. That's why I kept looking elsewhere. Transcend was the best scum player in the playerlist so I figured if anyone was fooling me, it was probably him and tried to make sure it wasn't taken for granted that he was town. I didn't think Gerryoat was scum but couldn't figure out who else it could be so I hammered that lynch.<br><br>After Gerry flipped town and Transcend was confirmed, it was between GDP and Projectmatt and I laid out exactly why I thought Projectmatt was town. That's why I thought it couldn't be anyone other than GDP's slot and we know how that turned out.<br><br>Also, Creature, look at projectmatt's read on you. All through the game he questions townreads on you, keeps you in the POE pool, asks me and Transcend why we're townreading you, and now suddenly in lylo, he looked over your posts and they all seemed too genuine to be scum and you are town because you told me and him to talk about our thoughts on the game? That's bullshit. He's \"townreading\" you now and attacking me because he knows that me and Transcend will never vote you and that his only chance of winning is to push me.<br><br>By the way, I figured TellTaleHeart was the JK when I was reading the game N2. Do a google search for this pic:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9372053#p9372053\" class=\"postlink\">post 781</a>, TellTaleHeart wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9371763#p9371763\" class=\"postlink\">post 760</a>, rb wrote:</cite>something about TTH is really soulless btw</div></blockquote><br>I am <span style=\"font-style: italic\">not</span> soulless.

As luck would have it, I found out that in the previous game she played with Boon, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7702400#p7702400\" class=\"postlink\">she crumbed in the exact same way</a> and was the JK there too. This basically clears me. I would never have killed rb over TellTaleHeart there. Boon was too thick to figure it out and projectmatt wasn't following the game closely enough. If I were scum, the JK would be dead N2. Projectmatt/Boon team are the only ones who have anything to gain from the rb kill."}

He's \"townreading\" you now and attacking me because he knows that me and Transcend will never vote you and that his only chance of winning is to push me.</div></blockquote><br><br>Hey now that's just straight up lying. I explained my thought process VERY plainly, and my reasoning for townreading Creature is literally because my entire approach to the game has changed. Let me quote it for you again:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9496699#p9496699\" class=\"postlink\">post 4670</a>, projectmatt wrote:</cite>Alright well, I'm changing my approach drastically.<br><br>You know, one of the things that I've been struggling with while re-reading this game is that trying to figure out who the mafia is based solely on BV/Creature's individual flaws is nearly impossible. If I went solely off of who played the better game reads-wise, then I would suspect Creature - especially because his ISO shows him being really noncommittal toward lynching Boon/Dunker/trying to divert the lynch to Graphic on d2. For the last hour or so of writing, Creature being scum is actually exactly where I was leaning toward. I spent over an hour gathering quotes and trying to point out to myself how they were scummy, but honestly, it doesn't feel right at all. I just can't call Creature scum in spite of some of rougher parts of his ISO. His overall tone and general manner are really, really towny. <br><br>In particular, the way he's currently treating himself as definitively clear is actually a towntell to me. His last post essentially said \"you two should share your thoughts throughout the game\", as though the game was certainly between me and BV. I don't have the guts as mafia to literally proclaim myself as definitely not being mafia when I'm a non-clear, and that post honestly feels almost like a townslip to me. I wish I could explain that better, but the way I feel about that post are the way that the majority of his posts are making me feel when I read through them.<br><br>From an objective perspective, his posts could easily have scum motivation behind them. In particular, a lot of his posts in the past day have made me really uncomfortable - that's something I can highlight more if anyone is curious - but the tone and the attitude behind them really leads me to believe that they must be coming from town. <br><br>I've always thought that the proper way to play forum mafia was to base reads solely on logical, concrete reasons. Literally earlier in this same game, I said this: <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9403909#p9403909\" class=\"postlink\">post 2269</a>, projectmatt wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9403252#p9403252\" class=\"postlink\">post 2251</a>, Creature wrote:</cite>You mean Boon vs projectmatt?<br><br>idk, do you consider projectmatt experienced? Or is it just because of date of join?</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm experienced in fast-paced mafia games that generally take 20-30 minutes. My approach to those games is based on logic and tone, but they go by so quickly that<span class=\"noboldsig\"> my approach to forum mafia (tries, at least) to be based solely on logic.</span> Forum mafia lets you choose your words so carefully that basing reads on tone doesn't work nearly as well as finding flaws/holes in what people are doing.<br><br>Why are we town v town?</div></blockquote><br><br>But clearly, trying to read games based solely on logic just isn't working out for me. It got me to figure out that Boon was scum, but it definitely hasn't helped me read players like Mulch/BV/Creature. If I approached reading Mulch from a tone/gut perspective instead of a solely logical perspective, I honestly think I could have figured out that he was town, because looking back his tone is so damn towny, but I was so caught up in all the ways that he had made logical errors that I just couldn't believe that he could be town. <br><br>I understand now that a big part of the problem of this game, and probably a reason why I'm gonna get lynched, is because my approach to the entire game has been incorrect. I need to start basing my reads largely on tone/intuition/gut, because trying to catch people logically just doesn't work. People are people, and people are going to make mistakes.<br><br>So, this is a realization that's likely to be too little too late - but it's the best I can do. I think that adding this new approach together with looking at this game with a fresh pair of eyes, BlackVoid is the last mafia here.<br><br>I think this game was set up very well by BoonSkies. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9426628#p9426628\" class=\"postlink\">post 3025</a>, Boonskiies wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9426617#p9426617\" class=\"postlink\">post 3019</a>, BlackVoid wrote:</cite>I still don't get why you are tying yourself to Transcend so hard.

Good game everyone. I think scum played well with the bussing, especially projectmatt but town was pretty stacked. I thought Transcend, rb, TellTaleHeart, and Flairs all played very well and didn't really buy into the scum theater very much. It's always fun to play games where others have better reads than myself. Creature is MVP for sure. From my POV, it was like having an Innocent Child that won't vote me and would vote scum most of the time and that really swung the balance of the game in town's favor. I should probably have spent a lot of time re-reading projectmatt's posts earlier in the game. In hindsight, the way he hung back most of the time and didn't really seem as invested in a Mulch lynch as I was should have been indicators that he was scum.

I think forum mafia, at least should use a lot stronger levels of logic and analysis that was/is used at EM, I'm not a fan of the 'gut reads' that people use at that site in most situations and think it attempting to use the same thing here at MS will have very little success in accuracy, game impact and maintenance of a healthy game state. I've noticed several EM's players post counts are balloon out of control with little of their posts actually saying anything in them with them often just repeating the same \"x is mafia\" type thing and it's a case of them not adjusting to the format properly.<br><br>I would agree that scum play at EM does very much help players town-tell as mafia here, people become very good at faking tone/reactions."}
