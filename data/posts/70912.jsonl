Communication to the mod is to be done through bolded text in thread or PM.<br>\n2. I am not infallible, but I have the final say. Feel free to correct me wherever I make a mistake.<br>\n3. Do not use encryption, ciphers or otherwise unreadable text.<br>\n4. Play to your win condition under all circumstances. Play for your own enjoyment and the enjoyment of everybody else ingame under all circumstances.<br>\n5. Modkilling is an absolute last resort. I may force replace players if it is necessary. I would rather not have to do either.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote formatting</div><br>\n1. You may vote for any player by using the vote tag (e.g. <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Human Sequencer</span>). No lynch is also a valid target (e.g <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span>).<br>\n2. A lynch is reached when a majority of votes is reached. A majority is counted as one half of the playerlist rounded down, plus 1.<br>\n3. If a majority is not reached by the deadline, No Lynch will occur.<br>\n4. Bolded votes, unclear votes or votes in spoilers/quotes will not be counted.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Game Flow</div><br>\n1. The thread will be locked until at least 10 players confirm by PM, at which point I will unlock the thread and Day 1 will begin.<br>\n2. Players will be prodded after approximately 48 hours of inactivity. After three prods or at my own judgement/player request, I will replace inactive players.<br>\n3. D1 and D2 will last 14 days. D3 and 4 will last 10 days. After that, days will last 8 days.<br>\n4. Nights will always last 48 hours regardless of replacements or night actions.<br>\n5. Extensions may be granted on my own judgement in dire circumstances.<br>\n6. Flips will quote the role PM a player received, with names redacted.<br>\n7. The game will end when any faction's win-condition is met.<br>\n8. Mafia players have day talk.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Flavour/Miscellaneous</div><br>\n1. Inspectorscout, my backup moderator, may jump in to do a votecount or post a flip at any time. Do not be alarmed.<br>\n2. If no players have flipped after two ingame day/night cycles have passed, the game will end in a draw.<br>\n3. This game has flavour! All flavour will be clearly marked as such. It has no influence on the game whatsoever, even if it may draw inspiration from it. There is no hints to be found in flavour, so don't try.<br>\n4.

Already been answers if you read my posts. <br>\n<br>\nIn post 24 I called out magna vote as shitty, because it was a terrible reason to vote somebody. He's making an assumption that doesn't make sense given what's been posted. If magna was town he should have asked more questions first instead of assuming. So based on magna's vote and reason for it he is either scum or somebody who isn't acting like a townie trying to figure things out so his opinions can be ignored. <br>\n<br>\nIn post 40, I'm responding to magnas 39 which was responding to my 35. Magna made an assumption without asking clarifying questions. I interpret that as grasping at straws. If magna is town, he's continuing this grasping and think it's productive. Typically town doesn't have to grasp, scum does. So he's scum or town grasping. If he's town again his opinions can be ignored cause he isn't being productive. <br>\n<br>\n35 - I don't give off the impression I think he's town. If you interpreted that way I'm sorry. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMagna is scum. Pretty obviously so at this point. His posts and thought process aren't ones that make any sense from a town pov. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThis all started because Matt didn't think it was a good idea to pressure key. I actually agree with Matt. The assumption magna made without any sort of questioning to me was a blantabt attempt to attack a player for something that on the surface may seem scummy to some, but in reality isn't at all.

Matt talked about how a wagon on Keyen could not possibly be useful based on a 1 game meta read while Key had exactly 2 votes.  That&#8217;s not a wagon.  I&#8217;ve already discussed how there was every possibility that a wagon on Key might have provided useful information.   <br>\n<br>\nWhat&#8217;s his Town motivation to try to pre-emptively derail a possible RVS wagon (which rarely go to lynch since most reasonable people know it is just for reactions) that might yield alignment information on Keyen on such weak reasoning?

Just empty rhetoric like &#8220;He can&#8217;t be Town / He&#8217;s 100% being lynched today&#8221; with a touch of unwarranted insults.  Basically a knock-off of Radiant Cowbells (who is himself a pale imitation of Fate) without any accomplishment to support the ego.<br>\n<br>\nFurther the fact that he&#8217;s not even looking at anyone else as scum is a sign this isn&#8217;t a Town push.   In fact he&#8217;s gone so far as to say that me having multiple scum reads (with his &#8220;threw away that&#8221; line which is nonsensical because having multiple scum reads and only 1 vote means putting pressure on multiple players requires vote movement) is more evidence I&#8217;m scum.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8951004#p8951004\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8951004#p8951004\" data-post-id=\"8951004\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 143</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28506\">TwoFace</a> wrote:</cite>It's not willingness to die.

HS was a component of the wagon (p88-101), and made that shitpost about crusader claims (86). They pretty much announced they wanted crusader to claim in their first post (63). I don't really know how I care about the curio flipflop (167)-there's no good scum motive here because both scenarios I can think of look like shit. Eventually the wagon got stale around the time HS claimed to kill the wagon, then they attracted a portion of the Wraith wagon. The problem with this is that the Wraith wagon was <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">actually a fine place to be</div> if you gave a damn.<br>\n<br>\nRight now I'm most interested in AA.<br>\n<br>\nReally dislike the handling of the Wraith wagon-AA goes back and forth with Varsoon over half a dozen posts about whether it's okay to wagon and the resolution of the curio, then when Varsoon makes a tongue-in-cheek response that they find it \"curious\" they're even there (155) AA affirms their actions but relents (156). I can't actually justify 156 as an attempt to further the wagon by resolving the curio and I don't see why the \"pressure\" had to stop to talk about the resolution during all these posts (133-156) either. If you want a reaction, you go for broke. If you want to further your wagon and don't care about the curio (133) why not tell Varsoon that you'll resolve the curio matter to resolve the reaction problem? Instead, AA comes into the exchange with Varsoon, gains a problem they don't want, and exits with what they started, while making no effort to push forward. Both problems had a solution. Get Varsoon on board with Wraith and see how far he wants to go with the curio at the same time.<br>\n<br>\nWhen AA accepts Wraith may have been joking (219) it's worth noting that Aragorn seems to have tagged out Arwen at this stage. For some reason I really hated the \"you talk to Arwen directly something something cry to HS\" bit. It felt like a set up to switch gears for someone on page four (221). Aragorn hints they want to loosen the grip on Wraith, and after Wraith quotes a bunch of jokes to Arwen Aragorn thinks they're frustrated town (229), shades HS but has their vote on Wraith in this same post. Aragorn seems to consider town!Wraith at 250. The earlier trend continues with Vifam (256), but then votes HS in 277. Nothing seems to happen wrt to HS or why HS' read suddenly became important from Aragorn's last post (263) to his post 277 with the exception of Arwen making themselves known in post 270.<br>\n<br>\nI really hate how AA has attached themselves to the HS wagon. It seems like it was premeditated (219+221) but wasn't until Arwen appeared that the green light was actually given. 232 was an incredible use of rhetoric to revise Arwen vs. Varsoon into Varsoon \"helping\" Arwen when it was really just Varsoon's obsession with the curio jamming Arwen's programming and stopping her from doing anything worthwhile related to Wraith. Seemingly nothing was said in the hydra PT harboring suspicion of this (247). If the hydra didn't care enough to note Varsoon over it, then why was the Wraith vote important at all? If their vote was better placed (which it was established after 250,256) it shouldn't have taken so long to change.<br>\n<br>\nI have a few other associative reads that I don't feel like sharing.

It's hard for townies to justify that sort of behavior, unless of course they're inserting themselves into the conflict.

Why do you keep asking key questions? This is at least the second time you asked him specifically. <br>\n<br>\nSecond. What posts make you think I'm hunting 3rd parties</div></blockquote>\n\nI'm scumreading you and my reads don't make sense as it is. I don't scumread Key much at all, beyond the fact that they would absolutely be your partner. Asking Key questions helps sort you both.<br>\n<br>\nSecond question:<br>\n<br>\nBecause you use specific words that don't explicitly look for scum. You're looking for \"not town\". This word choice isn't unusual. Typically, when someone claims someone isn't \"acting town\" they're making the claim to convince <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">others</div> rather than their <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">target</div>. In your posts in response to Boons, you are explicitly speaking <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">to</div> him, maybe even trying to convince him that he isn't town (which is ridiculous-unless you have a role, i.e. scum reason to infer a third party and guessed right). This is a break in continuity with how towns argue this line of reasoning-why not argue that he's flat-out scum? 3ps are by definition scum, but scum is vague and can refer to a single entity like groupscum. \"Not town\" seems more explicit (anything not town). Towns don't have this knowledge, and have no reason to use this line of thought beyond \"this person isn't one of us, get them!\" and in this case, they would be speaking to towns about the not-town behavior.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nLet's look at that post<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8957505#p8957505\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8957505#p8957505\" data-post-id=\"8957505\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 526</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28506\">TwoFace</a> wrote:</cite>FIRST - Matt's reference to the lynch all liars was referring to my push on boon and had absolutely nothing to do with you.  <br>\n<br>\nside note, mod said we need to have fun so let's take a music break shall we?

You continued to push this bad reasoning on matt and even defended yourself and your reasons. <br>\n3. you abandon your scum read on matt and choose 2 other people and vote one of them, except the reason for your vote was for something non AI and as matt said basically a shitty omgus vote.<br>\n<br>\nthe issue of you lying came up AFTER all of these things. So at least get your facts straight if you are going to try and discredit the most towniest person in the game right now. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAt this point you are confirmed scum because we have caught scum in boon and you are still arguing with the townie who basically caught him instead of voting boon.

The only wagon of the three that seems likely to have a chance at hitting scum is Elena.

So they are just sitting back.  Which is why I suspect BBT at this stage.  Jaack also fits that profile.   Elena maybe fills that void as well but as I said I have to look back at how her wagon came together to see what I think.

He is someone who just came here from EM, and as you know (or very well should considering how long you have been on site) people from EM don't do things the way that people normally do.

Does it happen every once in a while? sure but most of the time it doesn't. to say his response felt \"empty\" is just a way to discredit him. His response felt genuine to me.<br>\n<br>\nYou also say his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8968662#p8968662\">688</a> is scummy, but his post is a good one. Just because there are exceptions to the rule (RC and FB) doesn't mean that town should allow such things to become acceptable behavior. If I played in a game with either of those people and they fake claimed, I would also be pushing for their lynch. You don't allow shitty behaviour to become accepted or else this game becomes harder than it already is. <br>\n<br>\na fake claim is a scum claim 100% all the time. <br>\n<br>\nYou say <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8968716#p8968716\">697</a> is not a town thought process. This is where you lose the ability to claim you are a good player if you end up being town. That is absolutely a town thought process.

It formed when Boon was at 4 votes and at its highest amount reached 4 votes to tie Boon for top wagon.<br>\n<br>\nThose votes came from Lycan, Grey, Jaack and Boon himself.  Half of those were previously voting DSOC, Jaack was voting Sheep and Lycan wasn&#8217;t voting.<br>\n<br>\nSo if the premise is &#8220;Elena was a Town counter-wagon to scum Boon&#8221; then I can&#8217;t buy that premise.  Unless you float Elena + MoI + DSOC as a scum team then scum wanting to arrange a counter-wagon to hypo-scum Boon had their choice of having Jaack and Lycan join a wagon on DSOC (3 when the Elena wagon started) or having all four join on my wagon (2 when the Elena wagon started).  Given how brief that wagon on Elena was I have a hard time believing scum coordinated a counter-wagon on a slot with zero votes to save Boon and then let it just fall right apart within 5 or so pages.<br>\n<br>\nIf the premise is &#8220;Elena is scum&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure what narrative make any sense with that.  It doesn&#8217;t track for distancing purposes for scum to really make a push on a partner and then immediately dismantle it.  No Town cred to be gained there.

HS was a component of the wagon (p88-101), and made that shitpost about crusader claims (86). They pretty much announced they wanted crusader to claim in their first post (63). I don't really know how I care about the curio flipflop (167)-there's no good scum motive here because both scenarios I can think of look like shit. Eventually the wagon got stale around the time HS claimed to kill the wagon, then they attracted a portion of the Wraith wagon. The problem with this is that the Wraith wagon was <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">actually a fine place to be</div> if you gave a damn.<br>\n<br>\nRight now I'm most interested in AA.<br>\n<br>\nReally dislike the handling of the Wraith wagon-AA goes back and forth with Varsoon over half a dozen posts about whether it's okay to wagon and the resolution of the curio, then when Varsoon makes a tongue-in-cheek response that they find it \"curious\" they're even there (155) AA affirms their actions but relents (156). I can't actually justify 156 as an attempt to further the wagon by resolving the curio and I don't see why the \"pressure\" had to stop to talk about the resolution during all these posts (133-156) either. If you want a reaction, you go for broke. If you want to further your wagon and don't care about the curio (133) why not tell Varsoon that you'll resolve the curio matter to resolve the reaction problem? Instead, AA comes into the exchange with Varsoon, gains a problem they don't want, and exits with what they started, while making no effort to push forward. Both problems had a solution. Get Varsoon on board with Wraith and see how far he wants to go with the curio at the same time.<br>\n<br>\nWhen AA accepts Wraith may have been joking (219) it's worth noting that Aragorn seems to have tagged out Arwen at this stage. For some reason I really hated the \"you talk to Arwen directly something something cry to HS\" bit. It felt like a set up to switch gears for someone on page four (221). Aragorn hints they want to loosen the grip on Wraith, and after Wraith quotes a bunch of jokes to Arwen Aragorn thinks they're frustrated town (229), shades HS but has their vote on Wraith in this same post. Aragorn seems to consider town!Wraith at 250. The earlier trend continues with Vifam (256), but then votes HS in 277. Nothing seems to happen wrt to HS or why HS' read suddenly became important from Aragorn's last post (263) to his post 277 with the exception of Arwen making themselves known in post 270.<br>\n<br>\nI really hate how AA has attached themselves to the HS wagon. It seems like it was premeditated (219+221) but wasn't until Arwen appeared that the green light was actually given. 232 was an incredible use of rhetoric to revise Arwen vs. Varsoon into Varsoon \"helping\" Arwen when it was really just Varsoon's obsession with the curio jamming Arwen's programming and stopping her from doing anything worthwhile related to Wraith. Seemingly nothing was said in the hydra PT harboring suspicion of this (247). If the hydra didn't care enough to note Varsoon over it, then why was the Wraith vote important at all? If their vote was better placed (which it was established after 250,256) it shouldn't have taken so long to change.<br>\n<br>\nI have a few other associative reads that I don't feel like sharing.

If you did think you were being scum wagoned, then there's no real scum counter going on. Boons being scum would justify the Elena wagon while Elena being scum would justify how the Magna+Boons wagon ended up being dug in.

If one thing is a sure thing, but I think day benefits from being continued, to discuss things that were overlooked, I derail the primary wagon to discuss what I want to have discussed.<br>\n<br>\nYou hated that for some goddamn reason, and rather than work with me, or get me to elaborate why I promised a conftown Gin on Cakez scumflip, you said continued your line of reasoning that my slot was scum with Cakez due to a single associative from Cakez.<br>\n<br>\nMy point is that we're seeing this game completely differently and unlike in Spyro you're not treating me adversarially (where did your scumread on me go for instance?)</div></blockquote>\n\nFirstly who says that I don&#8217;t have a scum-read on you still?  I&#8217;ve very curious about how you came to that conclusion. <br>\n<br>\nSecondly of course the facts and circumstances of this game are indeed worlds apart.  I&#8217;m not saying that at all.  What I am saying is that I had an accurate scum read on Cakez that game  and let it go due to game circumstances.   Cakez was easily framed as a similar &#8220;lazy read&#8221; that game and I was dead on.   So the fact that you take such issue with my read on Momo hear is suspect, frankly.<br>\n<br>\nAnd please don&#8217;t pretend your play there looked Town.  You lurked like a champ when I as the back-up Mod of Darkest Dungeon knew you lurking was definitely in your scum toolbox.  And you hitched yourself to Vifam who plays every game to make his scum game more effective so you had that going against you also.  What reasonable conclusion did you expect me to reach that game when I was correctly reading Cakez as scum and saw play from your slot that said &#8220;reasonable partner&#8221;?<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8989894#p8989894\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8989894#p8989894\" data-post-id=\"8989894\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1025</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28041\">Lycanfire</a> wrote:</cite>The premise was that from your point of view, assuming you were not being scum-wagoned (you seem distrustworthy of that in some post somewhere but that was my impression when you called 2F probably town), one of Boons or Elena makes sense as scum.

Closing in on Lieutenant Lycanfire was easy, and the fear in his eyes was obvious. Master Sergeant MagnaofIllusion took one arm, and Vice Admiral ZZZX took the other. Mechanic momo cautiously looked up to ThinkBig, before ThinkBig handed him the only functioning pistol they had left, and nodded. Aiming it at Lycanfire's terrified face, the hammer dropped.<br>\n<br>\nPilfering Lycanfire's corpse found nothing suspicious, and nothing out of the ordinary.

ThinkBig's and Lycanfire's remain unopened out of respect, but that might tip as the days go on.

He stated some BS about how town \"should\" react to a case of a lie (then did the exact same thing when i made up a lie case on him to prove how stupid his case was). The only people who like the case are Boon and Momo, who probably have at least one scum between them presuming Grey is derp town as opposed to derp scum (which I guardedly lean, but I'd frankly like to lynch the whole batch of them on the presumption of one scum amongst them). Later near the end of day 1 Grey said he actually didn't have much of a case on me, yet immediately leaped on the wagon again because...well, either it's a *really* obnoxious second reaction test (that is just making me scum read him more, because, y'know, I'm scum who has issues with cases based on lies unlike my town self would) or it showcases how empty and BS the case is because all he has between stating his case on me wasn't much and now acting like it means anything is the evidence of me not supporting a wagon on town and a claimed Mason being NKed, which I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest isn't anything compelling as far as suggesting I'm more scum today than I was yesterday.<br>\n<br>\nFeel free to read the game and see if any of the above comes across as lies or reality skewing - I don't think it will.", "time": "Sun Mar 26, 2017 11:48 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70912&start=1525", "forum": "53", "thread": "70912"}

Functionally no matter what anyone says about \"being bored\" or what-not the situation resolves down to two possible reasons.<br>\n<br>\n1.  Momo is scum lurking out the pressure on his slot.  Check his activity on site and notice he's all over other games but not here.  In this case players pushing counter-Momo wagons are where you should be looking for his partners.  In this case you kinda fit that profile since you hopped over to Grey when Momo started getting momentum.<br>\n<br>\n2.  Scum are under no direct pressure (meaning the wagons on Grey, Momo and Sheep are all Town).  Scum have no reason to rock the boat when eventual momentum is going to likely fall to one of those Town and get them mislynched.

Sorry but it is.  All you are doing is giving scum a lease to say \"Sorry, I can't catchup\" as an excuse why they are ignoring scummy play of their cohorts in prior periods.<br>\n<br>\nThere is 40 pages worth of interactions and posts available to massive.  Is a ton of it going to be super-useful?  No.  2F assured us of that.  But there is data to be mined there.

When it comes to squad conversation and banter, he's never been one to really get along. Perhaps this is signs of his lack of empathy, of perhaps it just made him an easy target. Nonetheless, he was the one chosen to die this afternoon.<br>\n<br>\nSome of the squad has gone a bit loopy, you see. Being out here all alone, distraught with paranoia, it can really drag you down. The results are still very interesting. Results like a group of crazed infantrymen holding down momo, whilst incessantly baaing, as if sheep themselves. It would be quite a scene, if anybody sane were around to watch it. Unfortunately for most, and fortunately for few, nobody is. The last man to commit to momo's death is General -Grey-, exposing his inner sheep whilst shooting momo through the skull. The last words uttered by our unfortunate friend being 'Any questions???'<br>\n<br>\nEverybody took a second to calm down before realizing they may have made a grave mistake. Initial inspection proved promising, as they pulled a tommy gun off of the corpse. Closer inspection, however, revealed it was a replica. Also found was a strange device attached to his arm-- Some sort of 'Pipe Buoy 3000'.

I think these two vote counts are pretty telling actually. Here I feel like it's 1 scum on each of these at the moment. All that was needed really. Also, previously key had been voting Grey with me, then he voted me with Grey. The final vote count shows MOI, zzzx, and momo join onto Lycan's wagon. At this point in the game, both MOI and ZZZx were town reading me, so obviously they weren't going to vote me. Momo hammered because he didn't want to be lynched. That's obvious reasoning there. With both key/zzzx on Lycan, there was no need for Elena to switch over, so it made sense to stay on me to potentially push the next day. Except she didn't push me. She went for momo. She kept talking about a \"Momo/Boon\" scum team, which is pretty ridiculous. Momo was not shy about trying to go through with my lynch. Ridiculous and obvious seeming scum teams, like with the game I had just mentioned I had experienced with when Realeo did it in ThinkBig's Under the Sea game, where massive was also in, it's a solid scum tactic. It sets Elena up for reasoning behind why she would be wrong and able to mislynch both momo and myself.<br>\n<br>\nI'm pretty happy with my read of Elena, Key, and ZZZx as the scum team.

Matt talked about how a wagon on Keyen could not possibly be useful based on a 1 game meta read while Key had exactly 2 votes.  That&#8217;s not a wagon.  I&#8217;ve already discussed how there was every possibility that a wagon on Key might have provided useful information.   <br>\n<br>\nWhat&#8217;s his Town motivation to try to pre-emptively derail a possible RVS wagon (which rarely go to lynch since most reasonable people know it is just for reactions) that might yield alignment information on Keyen on such weak reasoning?

Just empty rhetoric like &#8220;He can&#8217;t be Town / He&#8217;s 100% being lynched today&#8221; with a touch of unwarranted insults.  Basically a knock-off of Radiant Cowbells (who is himself a pale imitation of Fate) without any accomplishment to support the ego.<br>\n<br>\nFurther the fact that he&#8217;s not even looking at anyone else as scum is a sign this isn&#8217;t a Town push.   In fact he&#8217;s gone so far as to say that me having multiple scum reads (with his &#8220;threw away that&#8221; line which is nonsensical because having multiple scum reads and only 1 vote means putting pressure on multiple players requires vote movement) is more evidence I&#8217;m scum.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8951004#p8951004\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8951004#p8951004\" data-post-id=\"8951004\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 143</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28506\">TwoFace</a> wrote:</cite>It's not willingness to die.

I have Sheep as nearly confirmed town right now, over anybody else, so I don't want to look at that right now. I used to think it made sense for him to be scum with Elena, but after yesterDay, I really don't find that to be likely. If there was any bussing on that wagon, then it came from Grey or Key. This is the stressful and most fun part of mafia. I have reasons to town read literally everyone leftover, but I know that's not possible. <br>\n<br>\n_________________________________________________________________<br>\n<br>\nGeneral Play by Play:<br>\n<br>\nPZ's bringing up the 4-2 seems more unlikely as scum than town, but it's really NAI. I'm wondering who he forgot was in the game. <br>\n<br>\nKey was with the two masons on the MOI (PZ) slot when Elena was voting with MOI on momo. Scum is probably on the MOI wagon at that time, and BBT(massive)/key were on that. One of them are most likely scum.<br>\n<br>\nthe Lycan wagon was weird. I pushed it because I was in danger of being lynched. Elena went to me instead of momo, and sheep/lycan were also on me. This helps me believe it was only 1 scum on my wagon in Elena, as why would scum care if Lycan get lynched. <br>\n<br>\nUnfortunately, Grey, ZZZX, MOI (PZ), and Key, were all on that wagon, and all the 3-6 slot on the wagon. Oi. I believe the two scum would have to be in that.<br>\n<br>\nElena's vote was constantly on me; I was a threat to her. massive's vote since entering has been on grey just like Elena was on me. Would they be comfortable with two scum seemingly focusing on only one lynch? I'm not sure, i'll look into it more.<br>\n<br>\nSheep votes momo, and MOI (PZ) follows. MOI and sheep unvote, Key and Grey go there, followed by Elena. Is this three scum pushing momo? Possibly, as MOI/Sheep go back, followed by confirmed town Titus and then Grey with the hammer. The remaining two scum are most likely on this wagon, which might counteract ZZZX/massive. We would have to believe momo was an all town wagon besides Elena would be town, and with how off and on that wagon was, I find that highly unlikely. Massive, ZZZX, myself, and Aristo (the last mason) were the 4 off that wagon. I'm not thinking that it's massive/zzzx at all. One of them could be, but not both.<br>\n<br>\nI vote Elena, sheep immediately follows, along with Key. A counter wagon on key immediately appears by the votes of Grey and ZZZx. massive is still on grey. <br>\n<br>\nwas a no lynch a bad option for scum? Because I don't see a reason for Cloud to lynch himself if 2 scum are off the wagon. I feel that was a sense to frame someone else, so I do think that scum is on the wagon now. At least one. If there was 2 scum in MOI (PZ), ZZZx, massive, then I don't think Cloud had anything to worry about with being lynched. I feel it was to frame something. <br>\n<br>\nWith all this said, now I'll post the potential duos leftover...<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSolidifying potential pairing notes:<br>\n<br>\nOne of key/grey are most likely scum. <br>\n<br>\nZZZX/Grey/Key/MOI have a good chance to have two scum in them from the Lycan wagon. <br>\n<br>\nmassive/key were on the MOI wagon at it's peak with two of the masons and momo. For neither of them to be scum on that, with me already explaining why I think Elena is the only scum on me, pretty sure that one of massive/key is on that. Unfortunately BBT's activity was meh during that point, so not sure how entirely reliable this is.<br>\n<br>\nKey voted Elena, but then was iffy on it. The counter wagon had Grey/ZZZX on it. Grey eventually joined Elena. At the same time, key really had nowhere else to go as he was the counterwagon. I'm unsure if Grey would have switched to Elena had he felt that Key could have been lynched over his partner. (which I believe he could have pulled off as scum. I'm starting to believe that that was a Grey town move. ScumKey had no choice but to bus.<br>\n<br>\nGoing to post interactions between the potential scum teams.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I DID NOT DO THIS IN ORDER AND I ADDED THINGS BACK AND FORTH WITHOUT DELETING THINGS. I MAY ACCIDENTALLY REPEAT MYSELF</div><br>\n________________<br>\n<br>\nZZZX/Key - Earlier I mentioned that ZZZX forgot to put key in his reads list, which kind of worries me. Then key forgets Aristo, who is confirmed town. Also it could have been a counter to Elena onto another buddy so that they come off looking town, but now ZZZX is going onto key again. ZZZx mentioned key was a lean scum earlier in game anyways, so I don't actually think this is happening. Key also has had zzzx as potential scum for a while. Key's tattletale of the misunderstanding with the ZZZX ban would have made more sense to post in the PT than the game. Also, I don't like this if this is coming from ScumKey. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Verdict: Not at all likely. <br>\n</div><br>\nZZZx/Grey - I don't know if scum would have both of them try to help their partner, but because Grey moved onto Elena (albeit with a big thing on me first which didn't pan out), I could see it. ZZZX is now voting Key, and Grey is voting ZZZX. Grey put ZZZx to L-1, so this kind of nullifies the potential of this. ZZZX very much could have been lynched. Grey's beetlejuice comment showed that he wasn't necessarily expecting it and had an eye roll like tone to zzzx appearing as he was being near lynched. ZZZX had been discrediting and not understanding what I was saying mainly during the times I was interacting with Grey, though, but that might actually be true confusion. Also, Grey had some rather not nice things said to ZZZX during the bad times. (bad times = those first 40 pages of this game). Grey threw ZZZX to the wolves with his comments on ZZZX not interacting with Elena, which I counter later, but it wasn't really that much regardless. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Verdict: Not likely.</div><br>\n<br>\nmassive/key - massive called key's post ick. And it would mean there were two scum on the MOI wagon, and only one on the momo in Elena. I guess that's still possible. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Verdict: Unfortunately, the most likely Key pairing...</div><br>\n<br>\nmassive/grey - HA! I actually don't know why I left this up here. Grey vs Boon interaction yesterDay, massive ended with countering Grey. Also, immediate vote onto Grey and hasn't left. Although, I've been scum partners with massive before, and post game he did say that going into the game, he thought he was probably going to bus me for some town cred, but I don't think that's happening here. If it is, well fuck me, right? Grey talks to BBT and comments about how they \"agreed\" that grey would speak first. Joke post, but if this is the pairing, that means that Grey flat out commented to both of his partners from the get go. massive's push on grey came from Grey's \"scum claim\". Grey says he claims scum in every game, and yet massive is reasoning that for a lynch? I feel he has other reasons, but I guess it could be fabricated. Grey says he didn't peg massive for being so superficial. massive said he could tell him why he's scum, and grey responds \"sure why not. let's hear why you're wrong\". massive brings up a thing on page 3 about grey pushing something then completely dropping it to argue with 2F. massive also pushes that grey shouldn't be getting a pass for his playstyle and this isn't towngrey. Grey replies this is just apathetic town grey. Grey points out the lack of interaction between massive and Elena toDay. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Verdict: Not at all. (came back to this after looking up other things...meh, it might be a thing...) I came back to this, and my verdict is it's the one of the more likely pairings annoyingly, but I don't fucking know anything anymore. </div><br>\n<br>\nPZ(MOI)/Key - MOI and Key had a good amount of interactions. Key was against people calling MOI town, or at least discrediting it a bit. Also, MOI made a few condescending remarks to key. key kept talking about and staying on the side of the MOI vs 2F interactions, and then ended up voting MOI. Key also pointed out one of MOI's contradictions, but couldn't entirely make a case on him, but it looked like he was trying. MOI's RVS vote was on Key. MOI points out an angle he thinks is deeply flawed in Key, regarding myself and does one of those change the word things to make it flip perspectives. MOI seems very condescending towards Key. A lot of noob shaming. MOI called out Key for pushing him while momo wagon was up there. Momo flipping town means key wasn't looking for a counterwagon. MOI tells key that he's looking pretty good for being on the momo wagon \"if he flips scum\". Before he was sure. I feel MOI tried to end up buddying Key. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Verdict: I really don't think so. </div><br>\n<br>\nPZ(MOI)/Grey - They cross called each other gullible. Grey talked about someone not even claiming an intent, and MOI called him out for Grey not actually caring. Grey told MOI \"for the love of god MOI call bullshit\" Not sure what it means based on phrasing, but i think he was saying MOI was full of it. MOI then explained in a lot of detail what he was saying, and then told grey to go back on momo. Subtle way of getting partner to have a reason to move vote? Grey asks a question about why lycan is town, and moi answers \"good chance he isn't\". This is how a lot of their interactions go. Grey early calls the MOI wagon a vanity wagon, and directs focus elsewhere. He defends MOI and takes the offensive against TF early. BUT GREY VOTED MOI AND PUT HIM TO L-1 BUT SAID HE THOUGHT IT WAS A HAMMER OH FUCK THIS IS A GAME CHANGER. God damn it. god damn it. god damn it. First of all, if you all hadn't noticed by now, I did not do this post in order AT ALL. I even came into this post thinking that I was going to think of PZ/Grey as the scum team, but this changes basically everything. This was the last thing I did too. Fuck. But then...Grey calls MOI (along with myself) doing mindlessly bad things and it makes them town. When Grey was wanting Sheep/ZZZX lynched, sheep was against MOI lynch, so Grey voted MOI because sheep didn't want MOI lynched. Admits that he was fighting MOI wagon, and tried telling Lycan that if he voted Boon that day, he'd vote MOI the next. MOI was getting an \"urge\" to call aristo scum, and grey turned it down. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Verdict: I don't fucking know. To me this makes the most sense, but things happened that make it seem like it absolutely can't be. Maybe?</div><br>\n<br>\nKey/Grey - Key posted after the momo lynch that he was really really sure that momo would flip scum. And grey, the hammer person, posted that key was really really wrong. That's weird. Key does constantly post how he doesn't like how Grey was acting a lot. Said it was weird. Key stats on grey's anti-townness a few times too. Grey comments to key real early \"You made it\". Grey posts to key \"you're not one to talk about not having a stereotypical town game\" key questions why grey is defending me, and asks if he sees my posting as town. grey says yep. not his first game with me, but then backtracks to null, but still not lynching me day 1. Grey, a little near the end of the Boon Tunnelfuck gets a little upset and asks if someone can tell him why they are town reading key. Then, Grey notes about asking a simple question and brings up that key gets pissy with him. he doesn't say it to key, more of a general statement. Grey votes key after key gives a \"sure, I'm scum post\" in a very grey like manner. Key brings up that he was scumreading grey for a long time, but \"didn't really pay attention to it\". Grey votes Key. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Verdict: Not likely at all.</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nNotes on specifics:<br>\n<br>\nGrey's comments about me not being a threat made me feel like my reads were potentially wrong from the day prior, as Aristo died last night. She was a mason, though. Regardless, Aristo didn't have much analysis and wasn't a threat either, so it seemed like scum was happy with what was going to occur, so Grey could have seemed content, so they killed an inactive player. The beetlejuice comment was iffy for me too, although yet another possibly NAI thing.<br>\n<br>\nMan, ZZZX is genuine as hell. Also, Elena asked about thoughts on her Boon case and asked why ZZZX was town reading me, where zzzx stated and implied a pretty strong town read on me. I feel this was scum trying to get ZZZx open to the lynch. This counters what grey had said about interactions. And with certain things ZZZX has gone through and said, I'd be pretty upset if he ended up being scum. He needlessly town read me, could be pocketing, but it obviously didn't work entirely. Also, why would ZZZX try and town read myself, MOI, and sheep during that time. Scum, even if they know the player, could have a field day with us. We were the three obnoxious ones. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, this (momo boon keyen massive ZZZX) was a titus scum read list, so maybe we can conftown everyone here. Lol. Titus can be a real threat late game if she is caught up on the game, and had gone through enough thought processes. If Grey/Zito is the team, then Titus = MVP due to her reverse reads. <br>\n<br>\nmassive doesn't have a lot of posts, but the amount of posts he has makes sense for the amount of time he's been in the game along with how much he usually posts in games. He's been on grey since entering the game. He was opposed to lynching CK, which I don't know if a scum partner would try to defend CK there like that, and so strongly. He really didn't like Grey, so him not liking the company there, along with calling Key's post \"ick\", makes sense. He also said that he could go key, but didn't help out really. I don't know why he's voting Grey actually. But they kind of got into it. Scummassive would be able to fabricate more of a case if he really wanted Grey lynched.<br>\n<br>\nah man, looking through key's posts, I feel he's town flailing (we all do it sometimes), and scum is taking advantage. That's just gut, though, that playstyle can be copied as scum. I feel like his reads have been pretty consistent. ZZZx/sheep has been lean for him for a while. I liked his \"I don't know how I made this post\" as I have plenty of those feelings as town. What scum would push Elena and I as both scum? Accidentally, though it makes sense to be fabricated. Vote count, I do feel that Key looks the worst out of anyone. (grey's vote count is more sporadic, but it's also more NAI) He also forgot to put Aristo on the list, who was conf town. Would scum forget the existence of a mason? Titus was still alive at the time, too, so it's not like he was considering the obvious NK already. he did put probably scum as momo and elena, and then went through with lynching Elena...yeah, he's had zzzx as prob scum, and Sheep as null to okay lynching for a while. I think he has had the most easy to follow reads that don't even look fabricated...although Key does defend Elena early game, but it changes in a natural way. he also brings up that the game is hard to follow and did a woe is me on being in this game, and it came across like it really was just too much for him. I don't know if Scum would have felt that way. Chaotic is good for newb scum who doesn't have pressure on them. This gives me town points to Key. The Key/MOI interactions make me feel a little less sure on Key being town, but the things that MOI was condescending about to Key, I understood why Key would be thinking what he was. <br>\n<br>\nMOI rvs'd key. Left pretty early, nonetheless. he also called out Elena for not responding to Lycan's question about Elena's read, and gave a pretty aggressive tone with it, I feel, but Elena responds that she indeed did, where he admits his mistake. He also talks to Elena, who feels MOI has a scum read on her, and states he doesn't. Also, he wrote to Elena again about asking for her thoughts on the wagon on him. MOI and I were linked really early in the game from TwoFace and MOI, yet MOI still was pushing me a little, but not fully. More focused on momo/twof. He points out the flawed thought process of anyone who thinks him and I were a scum team based on the two of us being the dominant wagons Day 1, with Elena having a small thing, but he stated a town read there. Stated a scum on the BBt/massive slot. he states the potential of bbt waiting to finish a mislynch on him or myself. That's a bit odd actually, considering he was laying suspicion a little earlier, but I do remember MOI not actually pushing me, and I did think I was town read by him. We faught 2F, so within that, I could see why his read would change. Actually, he did state that I am \"likely town for gamestate\", and discredited the fact that he \"knew Elena was town\", maybe distancing from a close up buddying? Actually MOI was actively stating I was town, and even pushing my fake claim BP thing as inherently town as it would be stupid as scum to do it. I understand why TownMOI would be on momo after looking at the posts between the two. He town read Elena a little too hard, though...ugh. More and more MOI/Elena conversing. Elena made sense of a bad play 2F did, and MOI countered that with \"No, it doesn\"t make sense. It was bad...yadda yadda\" Ah there it is. There's a post where he talks about finally going through with momo lynch with potential partners of Boon and Elena. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9043379&amp;sid=6136b48fee69c88ce685980823a329da#p9043379\" class=\"postlink\">This</a> post is full of complete rerouting and bussing a partner, but setting up for mislynching both myself and momo, along with keeping the sheep vote open. MOI posts about momo flipping scum, then I'm definitely his next push. After so long of saying it wasn't really a chance at all. PZ comes in, and says he's pretty sure Sheep is town, despite getting into with him. I've seen PZ do this before, though. NAI. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9081250#p9081250\" class=\"postlink\">This</a> post makes me feel like Zito's trying to help Cloud get an out. In this case, PZ's post about quitting the site if it was a town self vote and quitting would have been fabricated, which I see why scum would make that decision for the potential town cred. I actually do find it weird that PZ voted pretty early. Last time I played with him, he was very reserved with his vote. It looks as if he could be trying to get both Sheep and I on his side to mislynch ZZZX. I'm confused on what I think about Zito's 4-2 comment. I feel like scum would be more aware of if it was mylo/lylo or not, but he had brought up and interacted with everyone in the game, and I don't know who he would have left out. <br>\n<br>\nUgh, I don't want to read Grey's ISO. Here goes...Grey RVS's Elena. Next post he comments to BBT(massive) in a joke post about how they agreed that he was to talk first. I feel that this is something Grey might do as scum...-.- Elena plays along and joke votes back. We're going to get a lot of buddying from Grey/Elena here...Grey nearly hammers MOI, but plays off he thinks it was a hammer. Grey does a lot of \"what if I'm scum...\" yadda yadda. Grey antagonizes me and does small jabs to get me worked up, then i vote Elena, he sheeps. He constantly is voting his town reads and flip flopping around. he gets town read after being scum read and goes \"you give me that scum read back mister!!!\" Comes back to me, then unvotes and state that it's hilarious to get me to react, which we'll find out later he does too...-.- If grey is town, Elena was probably crapping her pants this entire game with paranoia of not knowing if he'd go on her or not. She posted \"and i thought grey in the last game was a handful\". he goes back and forth between myself and elena a few times, but states that elena votes he was just messing around, and also states he doesn't want to lynch me for going \"nuclear\". man, what good is that to not push me as scum. Grey calls what MOI and I were doing as mind-bendingly bad town, this is after his null read to me, but I feel like he was lean town. Elena asks him about his reads, and Grey says no clue, even though he was soft defending me for other doing bad, he called Elena's reasonings for voting me seemed sheepable. There's an in. He defends my reasoning for things Elena did as scummy by saying Elena wouldn't do that stuff, yet Elena ended up being scum. Grey says \"Elena is my frenemy, I can't go a game without voting her. Doesn't mean I'm going to blindly lynch her, though. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I'm not sacrificing my wincon over a playful grudge.</div>\" If they are both scum together, this still makes sense. Scum do this kind of thing, so don't argue that scum wouldn't. Unfortunately, it's still NAI. He attacks me for voting him. We go into a big tunnelfuck onto me. My lynch was getting steam, and in the midst of it, along with Town Mason ThinkBig, he brings up that he is getting cold feet on my lynch, and is one of the people to derail my wagon. Him and TB buddy up a bit, so he could be trying to pocket the mason, but I don't understand why he would try to get TB off of me when I'm nearing lynch. TB scum read me hard. Also...LOL at Grey saying that he thought Aristo was trying to say they should lynch TB...Elena made a joke scum post about Grey and someone \"falling for it\". Seems more like Elena buddying Grey again rather than them both being scum...people were looking at lynching Aristo, and grey turned that down when it started to look like it might happen and outted Aristo as the third mason, which some of us seemed to have missed. Grey's play gets called bad scum by sheep, who then Grey says it was proof he hasn't seen his scum play. Then goes \"Ask Titus how she fares against me in LYLO when I'm scum\". Which, by the way, is really funny to me because Massive and I have a scum game where we won with Titus in LYLO! Nonetheless, I say a similar thing as Grey did when I'm town. Also, so you remember, Titus said this \"You're an anti-town village toxicologist always looking to blame your shit on others.\", and you brought up you wanted to sig it. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"> Elena asks grey again about his reads, and grey says he's basically a mason supporter. This doesn't seem like SvS....UGH. I do some poe analysis, grey votes me eventually for me being dumb and not realizing aristo was a mason (yeah...that was my bad...), and grey and i get into it, and grey says it's grade a entertainment. But then, Grey asks me why key is scum...interesting. Grey does fight my elena lynch, but he <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">is</div> on me at this point, so this actually makes sense...Grey ends up stopping his vote on Elena after massive points out this is town Boon, which Grey agrees. Brings up no problem with a key lynch toDay, so that fits with where he is now. He also brought up maybe not rushing it, but puts key to L-1. I commented on the him not thinking of me as a threat to him somewhere on this post...he also questions my town read on him. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">In conclusion...did I fuck up and forget my role pm?

I feel like scum would be more aware of if it was mylo/lylo or not, but he had brought up and interacted with everyone in the game, and I don't know who he would have left out. </div></blockquote>\nNumbered for your convenience.<br>\n<br>\n1.  Yes, I am pretty sure Sheep is town.  Your second bit \"despite getting into with him\" is patently false - I've done everything I can to avoid devolving the game with a TvT quotefest.  My interactions with that slot are pure disengage.<br>\n2.  That was clearly not me giving Cloud an \"out\".  That was me starting the scumhunting process.  He was the lead wagon but like I said, instead of addressing whatever the case was against him he was making up bizarre conspiracy theories and talking gamestate which I thought was super weird.  It made me suspicious because he seemed to be avoiding whatever the actual issue was.  For you to believe I was giving him an \"out\" you'd have to decide that I replaced in and shined a spotlight on him instead of attempting to direct attention elsewhere.  In addition, if the scum have daytalk like you also seem to believe, you'd have to decide that after attempting to give him this \"out\" he didn't take it and hammered himself anyway?  What kind of plan is that?<br>\n<br>\nRegarding \"a scum making that decision for the potential town cred\" - you can take any townie action and view it in this light.  In this particular case though, for that accusation to be true you'd have to conclude that I replaced in, saw a game with very little life in it, saw a pile of dead townies, and decided to jump right on my buddy.  And you'd also be contradicting your earlier point - was the purpose of the post to \"give him an out\" or to bus him for town cred?<br>\n3.  You make this argument again below.  I have no idea what you're referring to or by what criteria you judge someone as \"reserved\" with voting but this is why meta is stupid and bad.  I evaluate gamestate and vote as I see appropriate.  end of gg no re<br>\n4. I'm absolutely trying to get you guys to vote/lynch ZZZX.  As I said earlier, I'm not being at all subtle about it.  I think he's scum.  I want him lynched.  There's really no way to spin this as anything but what it is.<br>\n5.  Again, already addressed this.  I was going by the list in the OP.

I'm very confortable in my ZZZX read.  I don't know what you mean by reserved and I don't even know what game you're referencing but meta is bad don't do meta.  This is a different game in a different state that I replaced into instead of started in and has different players.<br>\n2.  I'm not being subtle about it. I think Sheep is town.

But I think of Magna as being an aggressive player but more in the vein of \"figuring the game out\" and not just attacking people, which seems like his early game here. He asks a lot of very pointed questions, which has been missing. My experience is (I believe) completely with town-Magna.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8953964#p8953964\">207</a>: His question to Elena is the best example of this, and is the most Magna thing he does in his first 20 posts. Some of this COULD be due to the wagon on him, I imagine.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8954318#p8954318\">234</a>: Is a good example of how he's not trying to sort anyone.

Up to here, I haven't been able to figure out why Magna would continue to argue with Twoface, other than just to argue. He's not pushing them as scum, but he's also not in any danger (his wagon evaporated and Boon became the wagon). Granted Twoface is giving him plenty of ammunition, though. So why hedge the mason read at this point? Because this is where the momentum swings back to him -- Twoface and ThinkBig move back to him in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8972948#p8972948\">803</a> &amp; <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8972963#p8972963\">804</a>. <br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8985728#p8985728\">988</a>: Normally I'd expect Magna to work to elicit that content rather than offhand mention players who are lurking.

I had a solid town read on ZZZx the majority of the game, and I'm going to stick to it. Especially after this day. ZZZx has been pushing for Key for two days now.
