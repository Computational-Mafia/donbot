Nobody wants to be a loser.<br>2] Do not take screenshots or directly quote any of the PMs that I send you. Doing so will result in a mod-kill. Pretending to break this rule is the same as actually breaking it. You may paraphrase, but use caution. When in doubt, run it by me first.<br>3] Do not edit any of your posts, if you have the ability to do so.<br>4] Do not use encrypted text, hidden text, small text, or any other hard-to-read text when posting.<br>5] Once you have been lynched or killed, you are out of the game. Do not post anymore until the game is over. \"Bah\" post if you need to, but eh...<br>6] Do not talk about this game with anybody else outside of this thread unless your role PM explicitly says that you can.<br>7] Heated discussion is fine, but personal attacks, insults, flaming, and poor sportsmanship are not. Please don't be a jerk to your fellow players. If I feel that your behavior is preventing other players from enjoying the game, I reserve the right to force-replace or mod-kill you.<br>8] Do not talk about ongoing games. Like really, come on...<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Day, Night, and Twilight:</span></span></span><br>9] Each Day phase will last for two weeks apiece and each Night phase will last for two days. Once there are less than eight people, each day phase will become only ten days long. I will post specific deadlines in the game thread at the start of every Day and Night phase.<br>10] Players may continue to talk during Twilight, including the player that has been lynched.<br>11] If you do not send me your Night action before the specified deadline, I will assume that you are not performing an action on that night, unless your role specifically requires an action, in which case a randomizer will be used to complete the action.<br>12] If you know you will be unavailable during a Night phase, you may send me your night action during the preceding Day phase if you so desire.<br>13] Deadline extension requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Voting:</span></span></span><br>14] Please post all votes and unvotes using either the bold tag or the vote tag. Nicknames are fine, as long as I can understand them. Votes should look like this: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote:Boonskiies</span> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Boon</span>.<br>15] Unvotes are helpful, but not necessary.<br>16] Please refrain from engaging in any kind of voting trickery. If it looks like a vote, I'm counting it as a vote.<br>17] A lynch will only occur when a majority (more than 50% of all possible votes) is reached. The number of votes needed to hammer will be included with every vote count.<br>18] If a majority is not reached by the deadline, there will be no lynch on that Day.<br>19] Once a hammer occurs, no votes or unvotes will prevent the lynch from happening.<br>20] Additional votes include VOTE: No Lynch to end the Day with no lynch (which will also require a majority) and VOTE: Draw to end the game in a draw (which will require 100% agreement from all living players).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Activity:</span></span></span><br>21] You will be expected to post at least once every 48 hours. If you go more than 48 hours without posting, you will be prodded.<br>22] If you receive a prod, you will have 24 hours to post in the game thread. If you do not respond to your prod within 24 hours, you will be replaced. Additionally, if I have to prod you more than three times, you will be replaced.<br>23] If you know that you will have limited access to the game for more than a few days, please let me know either in the thread or via PM.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Communication with the Moderator:</span></span></span><br>24] I may be pretty close to perfect, but I do still make mistakes every now and then. If you notice an error with the vote counts, deadlines, or anything else related to the game, please let me know and I will correct the issue.<br>25] I will not answer any role-related questions in the game thread. If you have any questions about your role, the (theoretical) roles of any other players in the game, or (theoretical) role interactions, send me a PM. Do not try to trick me into confirming a player's role. I will not be amused.<br>26] If you need to get my attention, just include @Mod or @Boon in your post. Also, bolding will help catch my eye.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Miscellaneous:</span></span></span><br>27] Scum teams may or may not have day talk. I choose to keep this hidden.<br>28] If you have any problems with another player, send me a PM and I will do my best to resolve the issue.<br>29] If a player is mod-killed during the Day phase, then that Day will end immediately.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">30] My color is Purple (#800080) DON\u2019T USE IT.</span></span></span><br>31] The flavor text is for entertainment purposes only. Analyze it at your own risk.<br>32] Do not ask me to mod-kill, force-replace, or discipline any other player in the game. That is my decision to make, not yours.<br>33] As the moderator, my word is final. Please respect my instructions and my decisions. If I am not around, my back up mod should be treated just as I would be.<br>34] I reserve the right to change these rules during the game if necessary. If this happens, I will inform everybody of the rule change in the thread.<br>35] In addition to these rules, all site-wide rules also apply.<br>36] Claiming color code, timestamps, spelling, or any other form of non-public information is prohibited. <br>37] If the game happens to have multiple scum factions, I will play the game out through. If only scum remain, and all scum end up dying on the final night, the game will be a joint win between scum factions. <br>38] Go ahead. Find a loophole in my rules. Abuse of a loophole may end with a mod-kill. <br>39] I live in California, and have Pacific Standard Time.<br>39] You may notice that this is a second Rule 39. I am the mod. I have the right to do this because in the end, what I say goes. <br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Sample Vanilla Townie:</span></span></span><br>40] At least one person will receive this PM.<br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\">Welcome, [insert player name here], you are a <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span>.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #0040BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Abilities:</span></span></span><br>\u2022 During the day, you can vote and talk<br>\u2022 You do nothing special.<br><br><span style=\"color: #0040BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Win condition:</span></span></span><br>You win when all threats to the town have been eliminated and there is at least one town player alive.<br><br>Game thread is <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=72014\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>.

Any role that is created will be completely thought out and balanced in a way that I feel fits into what are normal game limitations, along with the idea of what a normal game should be. Don't get the wrong idea; this series is NOT about making a game with a bunch of strong power roles or a role madness game within a normal game. There may very well be as little as one power role, or even none at all. All this being said, I will always have this disclaimer for every game in my BooneyToonz series.</div></div></div></fieldset>"}

There's a lot of talking about how he needs to get a read on Maestro and then the following 'woe is me' period where we stuffed it up guys! We stuffed up his grand plan to get a read on Maestro even though he wasn't trying very hard. I mean, he told Maestro to ignore a large portion of the game because he's somehow the authority on what is worthwhile reading and what's not? And wasn't interested in what Maestro thought of those pages?<br><br>But now we have a magical town read on Maestro so it's okay.<br><br>And now there's a lot of engaging with Maestro trying to get him to lead things without providing much in the way of contribution himself.

However, it's one post, and I've already analysed it way too much.<br><br>Creative: There are some parts of his posts that rub me the wrong way, but I think he's town.<br><br>Fykus: My guess is town? Read needs updating!<br><br>Geralt of Rivia: His posts don't give off an impression of trying to work out people's alignments as much as a \"this is bad, therefore I am voting for this person\" kind of vibe. But is that in itself very alignment-relevant? I don't really know. It definitely holds me back from a townread, but I'll need to continue to evaluate.<br><br>Keychain: Opening posts are quite awkward and not taking much initiative. I want more to go off, but my guess at this point would be scum.<br><br>Keyser Soze: Probably town.<br><br>Klazam: See above. Main thing of note recently is the knee-jerky vote (and associated wording) to SAIHAG (if there's anything better to call you please let me know) over-reacting. I don't think I like it.<br><br>Maestro: I'm fence-sitting at the moment. I need more before forming an opinion either way.<br><br>Mulch: Leaning town, but the sudden dip in activity is something I could see happening if mulch were scum. (Obviously other factors may be behind it though)<br><br>Sergtacos: Probably town<br><br>SAIHAG: My opinion is town at the moment.

Pressuring mulch is either going to cause a lot of back lash or it may get him to contribute on day 1. I'm assuming it'll be the back lash though but I don't mind. The scummy vibes I get from mulch I've already stated. Seems to me he could plan to muck up the thread with Sergtacos in later day phases and he stated he wouldn't stand for votes on his slot. This early buddying mulch has done with Sergtacos could be so mulch has a reason to defend Sergtacos and as I said carry him through day phases to muck up the thread and help mulch himself get to the end."}

You're not asking a specific person or people to help you out with reading SAIHAG, but using the \"someone\", which has the advantage of looking like you're ~thinking about things~ and keen to have the advice of the town, but is actually unlikely to achieve anything in reality. If you were interested in a specific person's opinion then that would seem more genuine to me, but the entire post feels more for show to me, in order to look like your ~genuinely scumhunting~."}

He does have more content sense. I do still believe he's scum. The main important reason I'm on him is because while I do believe he's scum mulch mentioned a fykus deasvail scum team. He then ultra pushes deasvail. Seemed to me like mulch was distancing from fykus. So let's say we lynch deasvail and they flips town. Mulch will drop the case on fykus. Now I'm definitely more confident right now that fykus is scum instead of mulch being scum. If fykus flips scum then mulch is scum to me. If he flips town I'll get a better feeling about mulch being town. Ik pre flip associations are bad but I'll get a lot of info out of  a fykus lynch and I'm confident enough that he's scum to risk a mislynch. I don't think it will be."}

We can talk about Fykas roleclaiming VT (which makes him an easy/safe/non-PR lynch for a tricky D1) and debate over the scum-motivation in that claim, but that's all WIFOM right now. I'll look into Fykas' current scum-reads soon."}

His replace in is done in the exact same way as he did it in EverHope - where he just quotes a buch of posts as well and replies to them very briefly, and in a very detached way. I did my catchup at nearly the same time as he did. Nothing of the vibes he gives of sound familair. Nowhere did I go \"oh yeah, I felt the same way about this as he did!\". It feels fake.

He just appears to be trying to say things that he think will sound good. There is no \"soul\" to his play. There is no emotion. He doesnt appear to be figuring things out, hes not prodding, he's not passionate about anything. Its just carefull calculation, meant to sound good without drawing any attention to himself so he can stay under the radar for now.

Youre welcome to correct me if i missed that though.<br><br>---<br><blockquote><div><cite>Vecna wrote:</cite>At any rate, im still not sure how anyone could scumread and want to lynch mulch there</div></blockquote>  full disclosure- my vote wasnt because i was scumreading mulch, it was purely policy. Idk about Taco's vote, suspect that was an attempt at a fake hammer to reaction gather, which shows me that Taco might be unsure about Mulch's alignment there, and Mulch's self vote was obviously not due to a scumread, so of the 7 people on mulch's wagon, its probable that only the first 4 was actually scumreading him, and 4 isnt usually enough for a lynch...</div></blockquote><br><br>Was tipsy on wine and the day after I realized about he could be going against his wincon as scum too. <br><br>I'm gonna be watching you boy. FACE TO FACE MOFO. @_@"}

Agree with everything herein, especially reference to Mulch in 1919. You'll have to ask Fykus to confirm this (and Klaz may have been too close to the situation), but it was my understanding, and just generally assumed in the Dead/Spectator thread, I think, that Mulch was kept alive IN MYLO AS CONFIRMED TOWN specifically because he was such a waffling, useless, easily-manipulated presence in that game that right up until the actual hammer on scumFykus after they decided not to NL it was edge-of-seat back-and-forth between Klazam and Mulch about who to vote - scumFykus literally did almost nothing except post the occasion IIoA; he let Mulch manipulate and confuse HIMSELF. Calling Mulch \"the stronger Town asset\" is not only wrong, IMO, (Fykus, if Town, would be more of a wild card to me and a concern over Mulch, who is, in a word, \"malleable\") it definitely seems to imply knowing the two wagons on them (Mulch / Fykus) were TvT.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Tchill</span>"}

Have you expressed views against scum self-hammering before?</div></blockquote><br><br>Don't recall saying anything for or against that tactic in the past, before my hiatus. Post-hiatus, i've not dealt with that situation. But in general, as i understand the game theory behind it- there's only two situations where a selfhammer is beneficial: selfhammering as town to set up a 1-1-1 endgame between town/scum/sk(or second scum), or 3 minutes before the deadline expires on the day to ensure a flip and at least some information. That's as town. Selfhammering as town in any other case is pushing for the mislynch of a town player, which always is harmful to the town win condition. As scum- you are in a small team- if you selfhammer, you automatically cripple your team (even worse if what Mulch claimed was truthful, he claimed that he was a scum roleblocker), The idea of \"denying town discussion time\" is complete and utter bullshit here, because you're handing a scum lynch to the town on a silver platter, instead of kicking and screaming all the way to the noose. It is entirely possible a flashwagon forms, or deflecting lynch on to someone who made a scummy vote(like me or taco), hoping for deadline to hit causing no-lynch, or, in this particular case, mulch could have faked a townslip post-fake-taco-hammer that could have reasonably convinced him of mulchscum's towniness. Instead \"oh you caught me\" then bunches of wifom. What is more pro-scum? Fighting the lynch, clearly. Anyone who espouses the benefits of selfhammering as scum is clearly wrong. Hence, cardinal sin as scum to selfhammer."}

But uh, I'll believe Klazam on this one about Maestro is Town because I played my first game with him and when he gets angry like that, he's obviously town. Otherwise if he was scum he would be manipulative. Which is why my vote wasn't on him. <br><br>Klazam= i'm being paranoid up the ass.

I didn't like who he was pushing, can't really speak for anyone else. Mulch selfhammered and claimed mafia for a bit to throw everyone off their feet, revealing their true colors. Maestro probably came out the worst, shouting about the way the move was horrible for \"both teams\". Looking at that now I see the \"both teams\" thing probably comes from scum trying way too hard to look uninformed. Night 1 I, the loyal cop, investigated Creative and got a No Result. It could be a guilty or a product of some other role. Not going to worry about the specifics of that too much because that's basically a Reverse Fairy Godfather (Fairy Miller?). I initially decided it was the latter because I townread Creative at the time. But I feel some more recent actions make him a bit more suspect. So far I've covered two of our suspects: Maestro and Creative. Next is Sergtacos. Sergtacos feels like he came into Day 2 with an agenda to push me and Maestro as partners. Another suspect, though less focal, is Vedith. I feel his posts do not have the same charm they do as when he is town. Honestly, I adopted this tell from someone else who used it on him. Vecna has some more universal tell I can't recall right now.<br><br>So the likely lynches in order of how much I think they are supported are<br>Creative<br>Serg<br>Maestro/Vedith (both around the bottom)<br><br>So I'd suggest ISOing those 4 and getting reads on them."}

With Vedith (and DV, even though they've been bitching at eachother and cross-voting on occasion [I think?]) I understand where each is coming from. Vedith reads frustratedTown, bitchingTown, and obnoxious-Town-who-is-used-to-being-crowned-Town-Leader-and-worshipped... but Town nonetheless. If I had to guess, DV is a VT, with little motivation during day phases and no real niche for reading the gamestate right now. No information other than what's in-thread. SAIHAG has pretty much been my strongest townread since their back-and-forth D1.<br><br>On the other hand, I need to do VCA to confirm, but TC is blatantly opportunistic here, first kindof mulling his way through D1, then literally popcorning at the Mulch-twilight-bullshit-fest AND THEN proceeding to use it as some kind of confirmation of me being Scum, even while saying that I was \"obvTowning it up\" and that I've done nothing to make him think I'm Town, which is fine, but that's not how fucking burden of proof works and he fucking knows it. Every single word Creative posts seems needlessly thought out, rationed, and crafted as they post, and I hate it. Also, I disagree with almost everything they've said up until this point about the gamestate, but I stopped reading their ISO eventually because it just made me cringe. It reeks of newbScum, or at least Scum that doesn't know how to say what they want to say (I forget the join date).<br><br>Fykus seems to be playing no differently from 1919, where he just coasted and dropped in every once in awhile to jerk off onto whatever wagon he thought he could get away with being on in a given moment (but I've already said 1919 is fucking me up with bias, hence why I haven't really mentioned him so far), and Klazam is also an unknown because I'm paranoid that he wouldn't be this paranoid as TvT Klazam, but really it's probably wise on his part and 1919 is messing with me there too - probably because I wasn't in it but paid very close attention and now I'm in this one but not quite able to pay as close attention as I'd like. I thought about replacing out N1 but *shrug* for what it's worth, I like several of you as players, and I wanted to stick it out.<br><br>PEDIT: Coasting means different things to different people, and lurking means another thing entirely. Klaz knows I'm not doing the former because I don't do that, at least not after getting emotionally-invested like I was yesterday. I've been busy with RL stuff, but that also rules out the latter. If you want to say something different, reference specific posts."}

The inactivity of this slot is killing me though. I haven't gained much information from them whatsoever. <br><br>Deasvail: voted creative for a while. Voted vedith for half a second while throwing some very, VERY weak shade at them then jumped back on creative. That pinged me. If vedith flips scum this slot should be next. <br><br>Fykus: during twilight he claimed he wanted to talk to me about me pursuing him if mulch flipped scum then he never brought that up. Seems to be coasting I agree and I think that lines up with his scum play. Throws a random vote on creative pretty much just to do it. <br><br>Gamma emerald: agreed with me about the pocketing statement I made of sergtacos, klazam, maestro. I don't see any scum motivation from this slot. <br><br>Klazam: our thoughts are pretty much completely different. He has more experience with certain slots and while they could be town I don't see any justification for why our reads are pretty much the exact opposite. I think it's just an issue with his experience with other slots. <br><br>Maestro: only time they've done anything was during twilight when mulch accused him of being scum. Since then I don't think they've don't anything that's helped me with my reads at all. Claimed he iso'd everyone. Pretty much said too many people were stupid then didn't provide anything else. I'm down to lynch this. <br><br>Sergtacos: I don't understand anything from this slot. I mentioned his name ONE time that he might be scum and since then he's been accusing me of scum without giving much information. To the point that our back and forth is only helping scum. Then he throws some shade at klazam and doesn't move his vote. <br><br>Vecna: claims that it's rough to watch the active players argue and that we should get along to help everyone solve the game. I'm wondering why they didn't pipe up sooner. If you're town and you feel town is shifting in the wrong direction you need to mention it asap. <br><br>Vedith: definitely lurking it seems like. Pops up whenever mentioned. Got a PR to claim. If they're town they're not helping too much. If this slot is scum I think deasvail also is. <br><br>If I had to guess the scum team right now it would be deasvail, vedith and one of (klazam, maestro or Fykus) <br><br>Only town read is gamma.  I'd like to say Fykus is town but I've seen him coast as scum before. <br><br>For those saying they're uninterested or there's nothing to comment on please rip me a new one. I know there will be disagreements."}

With Vedith (and DV, even though they've been bitching at eachother and cross-voting on occasion [I think?]) I understand where each is coming from. Vedith reads frustratedTown, bitchingTown, and obnoxious-Town-who-is-used-to-being-crowned-Town-Leader-and-worshipped... but Town nonetheless. If I had to guess, DV is a VT, with little motivation during day phases and no real niche for reading the gamestate right now. No information other than what's in-thread. SAIHAG has pretty much been my strongest townread since their back-and-forth D1.<br><br>On the other hand, I need to do VCA to confirm, but TC is blatantly opportunistic here, first kindof mulling his way through D1, then literally popcorning at the Mulch-twilight-bullshit-fest AND THEN proceeding to use it as some kind of confirmation of me being Scum, even while saying that I was \"obvTowning it up\" and that I've done nothing to make him think I'm Town, which is fine, but that's not how fucking burden of proof works and he fucking knows it. Every single word Creative posts seems needlessly thought out, rationed, and crafted as they post, and I hate it. Also, I disagree with almost everything they've said up until this point about the gamestate, but I stopped reading their ISO eventually because it just made me cringe. It reeks of newbScum, or at least Scum that doesn't know how to say what they want to say (I forget the join date).<br><br>Fykus seems to be playing no differently from 1919, where he just coasted and dropped in every once in awhile to jerk off onto whatever wagon he thought he could get away with being on in a given moment (but I've already said 1919 is fucking me up with bias, hence why I haven't really mentioned him so far), and Klazam is also an unknown because I'm paranoid that he wouldn't be this paranoid as TvT Klazam, but really it's probably wise on his part and 1919 is messing with me there too - probably because I wasn't in it but paid very close attention and now I'm in this one but not quite able to pay as close attention as I'd like. I thought about replacing out N1 but *shrug* for what it's worth, I like several of you as players, and I wanted to stick it out.<br><br>PEDIT: Coasting means different things to different people, and lurking means another thing entirely. Klaz knows I'm not doing the former because I don't do that, at least not after getting emotionally-invested like I was yesterday. I've been busy with RL stuff, but that also rules out the latter. If you want to say something different, reference specific posts.</div></blockquote><br><br>Besides not mentioning me (but what have I done this game I guess) - this seems pretty solid overall"}

The inactivity of this slot is killing me though. I haven't gained much information from them whatsoever. <br><br>Deasvail: voted creative for a while. Voted vedith for half a second while throwing some very, VERY weak shade at them then jumped back on creative. That pinged me. If vedith flips scum this slot should be next. <br><br>Fykus: during twilight he claimed he wanted to talk to me about me pursuing him if mulch flipped scum then he never brought that up. Seems to be coasting I agree and I think that lines up with his scum play.

I don't see any scum motivation from this slot. <br><br>Klazam: our thoughts are pretty much completely different. He has more experience with certain slots and while they could be town I don't see any justification for why our reads are pretty much the exact opposite. I think it's just an issue with his experience with other slots. <br><br>Maestro: only time they've done anything was during twilight when mulch accused him of being scum. Since then I don't think they've don't anything that's helped me with my reads at all. Claimed he iso'd everyone. Pretty much said too many people were stupid then didn't provide anything else. I'm down to lynch this. <br><br>Sergtacos: I don't understand anything from this slot. I mentioned his name ONE time that he might be scum and since then he's been accusing me of scum without giving much information. To the point that our back and forth is only helping scum. Then he throws some shade at klazam and doesn't move his vote. <br><br>Vecna: claims that it's rough to watch the active players argue and that we should get along to help everyone solve the game. I'm wondering why they didn't pipe up sooner. If you're town and you feel town is shifting in the wrong direction you need to mention it asap. <br><br>Vedith: definitely lurking it seems like. Pops up whenever mentioned. Got a PR to claim. If they're town they're not helping too much. If this slot is scum I think deasvail also is. <br><br>If I had to guess the scum team right now it would be deasvail, vedith and one of (klazam, maestro or Fykus) <br><br>Only town read is gamma.

I'll look over them again when I get more time, and am happy to hear arguments as to why he is scum also."}

With Vedith (and DV, even though they've been bitching at eachother and cross-voting on occasion [I think?]) I understand where each is coming from. Vedith reads frustratedTown, bitchingTown, and obnoxious-Town-who-is-used-to-being-crowned-Town-Leader-and-worshipped... but Town nonetheless. If I had to guess, DV is a VT, with little motivation during day phases and no real niche for reading the gamestate right now. No information other than what's in-thread. SAIHAG has pretty much been my strongest townread since their back-and-forth D1.<br><br>On the other hand, I need to do VCA to confirm, but TC is blatantly opportunistic here, first kindof mulling his way through D1, then literally popcorning at the Mulch-twilight-bullshit-fest AND THEN proceeding to use it as some kind of confirmation of me being Scum, even while saying that I was \"obvTowning it up\" and that I've done nothing to make him think I'm Town, which is fine, but that's not how fucking burden of proof works and he fucking knows it. Every single word Creative posts seems needlessly thought out, rationed, and crafted as they post, and I hate it. Also, I disagree with almost everything they've said up until this point about the gamestate, but I stopped reading their ISO eventually because it just made me cringe. It reeks of newbScum, or at least Scum that doesn't know how to say what they want to say (I forget the join date).<br><br>Fykus seems to be playing no differently from 1919, where he just coasted and dropped in every once in awhile to jerk off onto whatever wagon he thought he could get away with being on in a given moment (but I've already said 1919 is fucking me up with bias, hence why I haven't really mentioned him so far), and Klazam is also an unknown because I'm paranoid that he wouldn't be this paranoid as TvT Klazam, but really it's probably wise on his part and 1919 is messing with me there too - probably because I wasn't in it but paid very close attention and now I'm in this one but not quite able to pay as close attention as I'd like. I thought about replacing out N1 but *shrug* for what it's worth, I like several of you as players, and I wanted to stick it out.<br><br>PEDIT: Coasting means different things to different people, and lurking means another thing entirely. Klaz knows I'm not doing the former because I don't do that, at least not after getting emotionally-invested like I was yesterday. I've been busy with RL stuff, but that also rules out the latter. If you want to say something different, reference specific posts.</div></blockquote>"}

This is not the case, and I doubt as well that Fykus &amp; maestro are scum together here (allthough that rage attack from Maestro in the last few pages didnt come off very credible to me).<br><br>If I was scum together with creative you can be very certain I wouldve bussed him and bussed him hard if it was obvious to me there was an actual and credible cop guilty on him. You can check all my games on this site to see how bus-happy I am as scum (games that particularly come to mind are Pick your Power: Double deck, and the recent game called Biochemistry). As scum you can very clearly see that im always very early in bussing my teammates, and I have their death planned out way in advance as scum to reap towncred from it. Yes, this is a wifom defence, but all the people scumreading me for how I treated the Creative wagon should think whether scum would really try to save their buddy, or whether its much more likely to come from town not wanting to lynch a potential watcher claim, especially given the fact that all my scumreads were on that wagon. Im sure if Titus would care to shine in here she'd confirm what im saying here.<br><br>At any rate, with the inno on Titus this game is helped quite a bit, allthough its rather weird that scum didnt interfere with Gamma in any way. Its possible that Deasvail was protecting Gamma I guess, allthough when going through his iso I do not see any breadcrumbs to that effect. Even if Gamma is scum, I strongly doubt theyd inno their teammate, so im completely fine treating Titus as townclear. <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: [unvote]Titus</span>[/unvote] - some participation from the slot would be wonderfull though.<br><br>My top 3 scum-picks atm are Fykus, Klazam and Vedith's replacement, allthough I could see Maestro, Tchill and Gamma as far-away potentials as well."}

With Vedith (and DV, even though they've been bitching at eachother and cross-voting on occasion [I think?]) I understand where each is coming from.

Klazam, the way you've been defending your claim, it makes you sound rather towny.

Especially since Deasvail's role made him and the target ascetic (I guess thats potentially also a possibility for why you didnt get a N1 result). Fykus also feels a lot more like he is actually wanting to gamesolve here, over Maestro and especially Thinkbig.<br><br>That leaves Sergtacos (my townread since the start), Vedith slot and Maestro. <br><br>Im at that place where I just wanna lynch both of them, and I think thatll win us the game outright.

His replace in is done in the exact same way as he did it in EverHope - where he just quotes a buch of posts as well and replies to them very briefly, and in a very detached way. I did my catchup at nearly the same time as he did. Nothing of the vibes he gives of sound familair. Nowhere did I go \"oh yeah, I felt the same way about this as he did!\". It feels fake. If it wasnt for the way Geralt responded to the cop claim id be all over this and trying to push for a lynch here.....but the response to the vig seemed to genuine, so im gonna have to sit on this for a while longer and think about it.<br><br>Klazam feels reasonably different from the last game I had with him. He was an easy read there, that is an easy TOWNread. Here I cannot do the same, he feels far away, like hes playing through the mist. Silly gorrila you.<br><br>Mulch, Serge, SAFMGF (dude couldnt you have picked a shorter name?) and to a lesser extent Fykus all felt pretty genuine while catching up. They all made statements that I felt I could get behind, or where I could recognise the reasoning. Not that I agreed with everything they stated, but most of it felt like it came from a good place. Klazam did have a few of these lightbulb-moments as well, but not as many.<br><br>Vedith Vedith. Why so aggresive this game? I didnt like Keychain, and I dont like your play so far. Suspicion.

Not passionately at least, and it doesnt feel like theyre trying to figure things out.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Keyser Soze is basically a worse version of the 2 above. He just appears to be trying to say things that he think will sound good. There is no \"soul\" to his play. There is no emotion. He doesnt appear to be figuring things out, hes not prodding, he's not passionate about anything. Its just carefull calculation, meant to sound good without drawing any attention to himself so he can stay under the radar for now.

I\u2019m still posting this anyway. Ignore the parts where im assuming gamma would die. Bolded is stuff that i typed during the day.<br>----<br>Full disclosure, i really fucked up by claiming when i did yesterday. I thought it was a good idea at the time, but when that blowback happened, there was nothing i could really do, but to stay the course. My role\u2019s actually Even-Night Gunsmith. I breadcrumbed this in the first section of the first post today- first letter of the first three sentences starts with EGS. I got a result on Tchill that said he has no gun on Night two, and i have no other results to claim. I\u2019m sorry for misleading you all, but with my claim, i was hoping to draw a kill away from gamma, which became obvious wouldnt happen when all of you developed heavy suspicion of my claim. Dangling a potential unclaimed innocent in front of scum to bait their kill seemed like a good idea at the time. That\u2019s the angle i was going for,<strike>but clearly that didnt happen.</strike> Was hoping to WIFOM fake out scum somewhat. (M/Taco, you should know, I\u2019d totally do this shit) I was bitching at fykus because what fykus was saying was actually exactly what i was hoping scum to think regarding my claim, so me slightly overreacting to him might help my wifom work.<br><br>I should probably be hanged for it, i dont mind, but hang me tomorrow so i have a result to show for my lynch? Theres one scum here, so we have 2 potential mislynches before LYLO <span class=\"noboldsig\">now 2 potential mislynches and a no-lynch</span>, which means if im 100% to be hanged tomorrow, i can clear(or guilty) someone tonight, which might force scum\u2019s hand some. If youre thinking i might have false innocencent results- with the flipped scum\u2019s roles, i somewhat doubt that. <span class=\"noboldsig\">This is typed during the day- I checked the wiki, and the two false postitives i may get would be mafia doctor and mafia traitor. Doctor would exist solely to mess with my role, and given my even-night-ness, i doubt that'd happen. Mafia traitor on the other hand is an actual possiblity, here, but i have no personal experience with the role, and im iffy on setup design. do you guys think a mafia traitor fits here? WAIT there was a no-kill. Interesting. If nobody claims credit for stopping kill, this might actually be a explanation for the powered up scumteam. (Oh no, this isnt the case due to the wiki saying traitor is endgamed on death of all other scum)</span><br><br>Oh and i wanna address the counterclaim thing- Gamma (geralt)\u2019s claim as cop lines up nicely with my role, so i wouldnt see the need to counterclaim him. On the other hand, Creative\u2019s Watcher claim lines up none with my role + his choice of target was poo given the CLAIMED COP, so i pushed on that. Hopefully this explains the difference well enough for you vecna/tchill. Also, my flip would have clearly showed what role i was/my result/ etc so there would be no confusion.<br><br>Also yes, i wrote up this post during the night, completely expecting my ploy to fail <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> I was actually considering fakeclaiming a guilty on M and seeing where that leads, but I rationalized that M would just attack me for claiming an guilty on him whichever alignment he was, and this wouldnt accomplish anything.<br><br>One more thing, while i was looking over vedith\u2019s iso during the night- I realized that theres actually a quite strong association between him and fykus- Vedith kept defending him. This could be just him building towncred for defending a easy mislynch target, same vein as him pushing for the lynch of scum. Its just something to note. Still thinking fykus is probs town here. If i had to pick, i\u2019d have to say Maestro is my choice of lynch here. His \u201cepiphany\u201d to my claim on the end of the day previous felt pretty damn bogus to me. <br>----<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Now the following is stuff i typed up after i posted my first post today.<br></span><br>Ok, now, here\u2019s my responses to Fykus <strike>and Maestro-</strike> <br>-Fykus- Your thoughts on me being watcher perfectly lines up with your play yesterday. Now, why did gamma not die? Unless if someone claims jk/doc/roleblocker of some sort, this heavily implicates you due to the no-kill. (except not really because you could have just killed me instead. Hmm :thinking:) By the way its impossible for me to get an inno on tchill from seeing creative rolecop tchill, as seeing\u2026 creative was dead XD.<br><br>Lets end things.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: maestro</span>"}

And, of course, both of those roles are nerfed by the possibility that symbiotic will choose wrong and attach to scum (and even there, you simply get MORE roles that look like there could be a roleblocker action going on).  I think that this setup is fine for MS balance, and would probably approve it again.  MS balance is such that towns NEED a lot of power to be competitive.  Sometimes that results in town stomps, but bulk majority of the time it simply doesn't."}

So in terms of balance, overall mini normals aren't especially townsided, they're just \"townsided\" compared to what players THINK should be balanced.  A fair question is if this particular set of powers (jailkeeper plus odd/even cop/gs) is more powerful than given credit for (which may be a fair discussion to happen), but in general people just think things are townsided when they aren't.  It's EXTREMELY common for me to review a mini normal where the following two things BOTH happen<br><br>1) People complain setup is townsided<br>2) Scum win with 2 or 3 of their team alive<br><br>So I tend to take balance complaints with a LOT of salt."}

Town generally played well, in my opinion. If one or two of the night targets had been different, then town would have been completely in a separate spot. Gamma Emerald changed from targeting Serg to Creative rather late as well, and I was able to catch that on my phone and give him the changing result. Tchill was on Gamma, so Serg easily could have been a mislynch there and the entire game would have gone differently."}
