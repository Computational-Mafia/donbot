{"forum": "53", "thread": "67181", "pagelink": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=67181&start=0", "number": "1", "timestamp": "Wed Jun 29, 2016 2:04 pm", "user": "Dierfire", "content": "<div style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;\">RULES</span></div><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">General</span></span><br>01. Site rules may be found <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> for reference.<br>02. The rules are subject to change at my discretion to correct any errors or omissions. Should any changes be implemented, they will be announced in the same format as the original rule (for example, changes to the main set of rules will be announced in the main thread; changes to role-specific rules will be sent by PM).<br>03. Pretending to violate any of these rules will be treated the same as an actual violation.<br>04. Everyone is here to have fun, and I hope that we will all keep this in mind throughout the game. Please contact me directly (by PM) with any problems or questions. In the event that I make an error, please call it to my attention by PM or by addressing me in the relevant thread (I will look for \u201c@Mod\u201d).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Posting</span></span><br>05. Players should use English exclusively, without any form of hidden or encoded text.<br>06. Once I have declared a player to be dead, that player should not post in the main thread until I have declared the game to be over.<br>07. Players should not provide direct quotations from, images of, or other provable references to any game-related PM or PT.<br>08. Players may not use any form of provable randomness for any reason.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Timing</span></span><br>09. Each Day Phase will last 10 days. Each Night Phase will last 48 hours. In between, there will be a period not to exceed 24 hours for me to write the transition. Deadlines may be extended at my discretion as necessary to ensure that the game continues smoothly. Any such extension will be announced in the main thread.<br>10. Players who have not posted in 48 consecutive hours will receive a prod. After receiving a prod, a player has 24 hours to post before I will begin seeking a replacement.<br>11. If a player being replaced for inactivity should return to the game before a replacement is found, that player may be allowed to continue in the game at my discretion. However, once a player has been replaced, that player may not continue in the game.<br>12. Players on V/LA will be exempt from the prod requirements above. However, if a player requires an extensive period of V/LA, I may determine that the game would be better served by a replacement and replace that player at my discretion.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Day Phase</span></span><br>13. Players may vote to lynch another player using either vote tags or bold tags as demonstrated below.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Name</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Name</span><br>In order to be counted, votes should appear on a separate line and not within spoiler tags or otherwise concealed. Votes not following this format may be counted if I believe that a vote was intended.<br>14. When one player has achieved a majority of votes (more living players voting for that player than living players not voting for that player), that player will be lynched and the phase will end. If the deadline is reached before a lynch is achieved, no player will be lynched.<br>15. Players may vote to end the phase without a lynch. An example of such a vote is given below:<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span><br>If the number of living players voting for this option is greater than or equal to the number of living players not voting for this option, the phase will end without a lynch and the game will proceed directly to Night Phase.<br>16. Players may continue to post in the main thread until I have announced the end of the phase, regardless of whether or not a lynch has occurred.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Game Design</span></span><br>17. In addition to the site-wide rules, it may be useful to review the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Normal Game guidelines</a> and the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution/Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Natural Action Resolution guidelines</a>.<br>18. Any PT associated with this game will be open for use at all times (Day Phase and Night Phase).<br>19. No player may perform more than one action during a single Night Phase.<br>20. At least one player will receive the following role:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Welcome, (Name), to Mini Normal 1809!<br><br>Your role is: Vanilla Town, aligned with <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Town</span></span>.<br>Abilities: You have no special abilities.<br>Win Conditions: You win if all living players are aligned with Town.</div></blockquote>"}

This is my sixth game of mafia, specifically the third on this site.<br>2. I wanted to try some games that weren\u2019t role madness for a change of pace.<br>3. Reads lists are cool, and I make use of them, but I usually wait until nearing EoD before posting anything really in-depth.<br>4. I don\u2019t like it when townies lie. It is such a hassle to get things back in order when lying town is exposed, and typically the reaction results, or gambiting, (or whatever reason I guess) rewards aren\u2019t enough for to compensate for the risks. So I avoid lying as town. <br>5. Apple<br>6. That\u2019s ice cream right? If so, yeah, Ala mode is fine.<br>7. But he claimed Mason. If somebody claims a role that is easy to prove/disprove I\u2019m inclined to believe them. As far as Masons go if one is cleared it clears the other by default right? And it works the other way too as far as incriminating goes. So that makes this a horrible gambit if they\u2019re scum. Therefore I think Molla, and House is Masons. Which means I think they're town.

I would have said more about the game state if I\u2019d had not been so occupied yesterday. As for why I opened with RQS, it is because I thought it got a good result the first time I tried it, so I wanted to try it here. Maybe it would have been better if I did it right off the bat, but I wasn't here for the first four pages. How are you doing though, post 138 is the only time you said anything thus far, how have your feelings changed since? <br><br>Where did cmitc1 claim he was a newb? I\u2019ve seen a couple people refer to him as such, but the only response to this from the man himself is, \u201cI have some experience\u201d.

I remember someone saying scum don't like to answer because it could give them away or something. (Found it. Mini 1620. Thesp said people who aggressively refuse are scum. He tunneled my scumbuddy for this) I've found it more likely before though that scum go along with the cool thing to do which tends to be answering although maybe their answers are short \"yes\" and \"no\" types. I'll keep Rob in mind at least.<br>-BBMolla seems to have a mindset about RQS that was established long before this game. That makes his reaction pretty null.<br>-And I'm back to cmit again. It's interesting because we got refusals right away rather than the typical answers and Cmit came right in asking how it was useful and seemed to be acting like it was an original thought. He also quoted Rob though which I'm not sure if that was intentional or not but it shows he had Rob's refusal in mind before stating his own. Not a fan.<br><br>Grendel, BBMolla is right.

Meh. I don't personally think my alignment affects my play. I know that sounds cocky, but my game changes much more from other influences such as availible free time, playerlist, and mood than alignment. Maybe it's because I've played like 300 games so I'm over any nervousness about harder roles to play and I know what people look for when making their reads. I try to be open and genuine as both town and scum which is something that gets me townread whether I'm actually town or not. You'll remember I listed that as a strength. As for my weaknesses, I'm going to be too busy when RL happens. RL doesn't happen based on my role in a mafia game. I don't go to work more as scum. I don't take time off as town. These things seem obvious, but that's really a key factor in how people read me whether they know it or not. It's the same with my emotions. It's about whether people are making sense or not rather than my alignment.<br>6. Hmm. Good question. My first instinct is to say House just because I've had more experience with him than BBMolla or Hoopla and I feel like I interact better with him. But, as he will tell you himself, he's a much stronger scum player than town. I'd probably trust a confirmed town Hoopla's reads the most. So I'll say Hoopla.<br><br>Ohhhhhh. Cmit is a town of salem guy. Never saw that abbreviated that way before. Ok, yeah, that explains basically every issue I had with him. Still would like to know why he was comfortable voting after not seeming that way with Hoopla though.<br><br>Now that I'm caught up,<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote Masquarade</span><br><br>Believe it or not, Grendel's RQS may have actually led to something.

It fostered nearly twenty nine pages (fifty posts a page) of content plus a lynch on a forum that is resolutely against D1 lynching, and got players that normally rush to abstain actively engaged in the game. Also it helped me catch a scum based off of their response, there were a several other scum that had bad answers, but I didn\u2019t live long enough to push them. That said, I did come to wrong conclusion of several town as well when evaluating results. There was another scum who vocally attacked RQS for easy town cred, but I didn\u2019t live long enough to catch. The game is actually still ongoing, I was NK\u2019d, so idk if the second scum will be caught. For something that is generally put down as a waste of time I thought it operated well, and gave me \u201cGood results\u201d. <br><br>Context to the game in question is it is a whopping 48 player muti-ball, with five irl days for the day phase.

And that's already been talked to death. Everything else was weak. <br><br>Having three players bitch about each other for five or six pages isn't compelling. I had to no interest to read through that. It doesn't affect the game state and the emotions that came out of it are NAI. I have had more fun staring at a wall than I did going through that. I had enough of that in Mini 1674 and I'm not wasting my time on it again.<br><br><br>As for the RVS vote, let's look at who still has an RVS vote right now:<br>1. Me<br>2. Vedith<br>3. ChaosOmega<br>4. Grendel [In that they haven't voted all game, just opened with RQS]<br>5. Mask<br><br>Of those, Chaos has probably done the most. A bit of Pressure on Masquerade, his vote probably shouldn't count as RVS from the looks of it. He also added into the Vedith wagon without changing his vote. I also noticed that neither Mask or Vedith answered his questions. Even after Chaos asked Mask a second time for an answer.<br><br>Vedith has done just about as much as I have. Same post count, he's asked more questions than me but that's about it. <br><br>Each of Grendel's posts have dealt with the RQS. And there's nothing compelling about it. Breaking down Robb's, House's, Egg's, and Masqurade's RQS is fluff. Nothing there speaks to alignment. <br>@Grendel - What did you RQS questions get you?<br><br>Mask's posts are boring. Answering RQS, commenting on the Rob/House/Molla bitchfest. And that's about it. <br><br><br>I'm not counting Egg in the RVS vote count even thought they haven't voted, they came in at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8062116#p8062116\">185</a> and started hunting almost immediately. <br><br>So why did you focus on my vote, besides the fact that it is on you? Why did you focus on my activity when there are five/six other players with about the same amount of contribution as me?<br><br><br>If you want more content out of me, engage me. Because right now, I have no interest in rereading that sixish page bitchfest."}

I have a scum read and he's the scummiest person in the game and I'm trying to get him lynchhed. You guys are all defending molla because, well tbh I don't know why. You are accepting of his scummy behavior which is weird. The only thing I can think of is because you are all long time members of the site and know each other you have this unwritten rule to not actually lynch each other day one. Sure that sounds ridiculous but it's not as ridiculous as you guys saying molla isn't scummy for his actions. <br><br>When a player does something scummy you pressure him and try the get him lynchhed but that's not happening here. <br><br>Now if molla flips town, which I doubt he will then I'll probably bang my head against the wall or commit some other sort of bodily harm because I just can't imagine why a townie would do something so fucking scummy on purpose. No I won't apologize though because I wouldn't have done anything wrong. <br><br>You guys think I'm making an idle threat here. I assure you I'm not, unless somebody can explain why a townie would falsely accuse somebody else of something they did themselves and then get belligerent when called out on it in a way that actually makes sense. Your vote should be on molla. <br><br>Since nobody has been able to do that and the closest thing is basically \"town does scummy things\" which doesn't cut it for me. Because if that's the case and you all think vedith is scummy, you need to apply the same rationale. <br><br>Can't have it both ways people.

First and foremost is his interaction with Robbnva. Considering that House has previous experience with Rob he should have known that what a short fuse Rob has. Therefore I can\u2019t understand why a town!House would berate Rob so, there is nothing town could gain from it. Subtract House from the picture, and I sincerely doubt that things with Robanva would have escalated as much as they did. It looks to me like House counted on Rob to be mod killed.<br><br>Then Houses interactions with Wake look really bad. Imo Wake was very reasonable in his approach to House, but House remained stand offish the whole time. This seemed to set off some flags to Wake, as noted in post 501, and House\u2019s reaction was to scum read Wake in post 541. <br><br>Lastly is House doggedly defending Molla for no apparent reason. I guess he was town reading him sure, but rereading trough the game I swear the House jumped to Molla\u2019s defense MORE than Molla did, which bothers me. Mainly because Molla is a grown man who can speak for himself. The fact that BBmolla is widely town read makes me think that House\u2019s hard defense of Molla is for town cred.  <br><br>So yeah, I think House is scum lord.

The point of this point is to show rob that you are indeed fallible and wrong sometimes. Admittedly you are also right occasionally, but so is a broken clock. The problem is when you are wrong, you single-handedly drag the game into the mire for town and allow the scum to hide in the distraction you're creating. Stop being so egotistical and putting your own reads above everyone else's and ACTUALLY LET THEM TALK without you saying your piece every page.<br><br>There are plenty of games where you catch people in so-called lies, or hypocrisies, but they turn out to be town. You have to look at the motivation behind why these things are happening. Should town lie? No. Should town hold contradictory opinions? No. But town also shouldn't do all of the stuff you do that I've listed above, yet lo and behold, you do it every game. I suspect if you were in a game with a clone of yourself, you'd be scumreading each other the entire game for the antitown bullshit you submit towns to.<br><br>I didn't want to post something like this until after the game, because I know it'll be a distraction now, but today is already a shambles so this is my last attempt to get through to rob and get him to chill out and stop derailing the game.<br><br>Anyways peace."}

Mainly what sticks out to me is the intentional (?) misspelling in answer one, the joking in answer four, and the lack of any elaboration in answer five.

That said, I\u2019m bad at tonal indicators so I may have been too dismissive of your response to my questions. <br>Are you enjoying the game thus far?</div></blockquote><br><br>Misspelling: doubt it was intentional.

Anyone that knows me can vouch for that.<br><br>And yeah, the game has been fun.</div></blockquote><br><br>Hey now, I don\u2019t know if you misread me previously or are just seeing things how you want to see them, but I explicitly said that I wasn\u2019t scum reading you because of your role preference. In truth questions one and two were the least telling, and the only reason they\u2019re in the set is because I thought they were good appetizer questions. The others, questions three, four, five, and six, were the important ones. You\u2019re answer to four was weak. Three was pretty scummy, and five was non-existent. This gave me a null to scum lean, so I tried opening it to you to add more information so I might be sure of my read on you, but instead of working with me you shut me down in post 249. You even implied it was my fault that you didn\u2019t answer the fifth question to my satisfaction. Getting all huffy that I should\u2019ve asked for elaboration if I wanted it. You also were concerned that I was questioning your honesty, a point I hadn\u2019t raised. I had no reason to question your honesty so that attempt at ethos seemed like unneeded compensation. So yes, I have a clear reason to get a scum read off you based off those responses. It\u2019s not, \u201cHouse likes playing scum so he must be scum\u201d, that reasoning makes no sense and I don\u2019t appreciate you putting words into my mouth. <br><br>I\u2019m also noting that instead of engaging me directly about this you went to other players voicing their opinions of me and tried to discredit me. I\u2019d expect town to engage me with their thoughts directly. Not this roundabout crap. Why aren't you engaging me?<br><br>About the mod kill timeline thing, yes, I reread and you did say you wanted a replacement before advocating for a mod kill. Sorry for missing that bit. That doesn\u2019t change the fact, however, that you did say you wanted Robbnva modkilled. So can you tell me how you went from, \u201cI want Robbnva to replace out\u201d to, \u201cMod pls kill this\u201d? Because if you truly wanted to Robbnva to be force replaced then I don\u2019t believe you would have ever been okay with Robbnva being Modkilled even if he was advocating it for himself. You would have actively discouraged him if you wanted to save that slot. And the fact that at one point you advocated for Robbvna to just be force replaced doesn\u2019t devalue the fact that you later you encouraged a mod-kill.

I don't think his play was helpful at all but it was emotional and could come from town or scum. Robb is clearly infuriating to play with and House reacted. I understand your point about advocating for a modkill being scummy even if Robb first suggested it himself. But I think it's more like this - House is assuming that Robb is going to do something that will cause him to be modkilled. He's basically saying \"GET ON WITH IT THEN, GET MODKILLED\". House could be scum but it's not for suggesting a modkill.<br><br>N e way<br><br>I'm interested in lynching BlankFace, BBMolla, and Vedith today. That's it. BB and BlankFace continue to cheerlead Hoopla from the side and avoid scumhunting. I know BB probably won't be lynched simply because no one wants Robb to get what he wants, but he's actually scum y'all.<br><br>Vedith's content is pretty awful and he doesn't show much scumhunting initiative at all and has interacted with like three people total. I do find his Hoopla vote a puzzling move to come from scum though so I'm not entirely sure there. If it weren't for that he'd be my number 1 choice."}

I mean I guess you could say that as town, but I don't see why passive aggressive insults to get town read is a good thing to do. Mainly because its a step beyond attacking arguments, its attacking the player. So now you're falling back on meta that you're hard to lynch, and that should somehow make me town read you.

It's very easy for scum to say something incriminating, then before they get real pressure play it off as a joke. I've seen good scum players get away with this all the time. It's no wonder why you're good at scum if you're all always joking. Its no wonder nobody is seeing what I'm seeing right now. <br><br>5) Then why didn't you say that right away instead of jumping around the question? <br>you could have answered me with that in response since I didn't get it the first time. I did give you the opportunity. Instead you said I should have asked for elaboration if I wanted it.

I\u2019m to assume that everything you say is irrelevant, and/or a joke. And if you say something that pings me I\u2019d be an idiot to point it out or press you about it. <br>2) I\u2019m not supposed to care that you\u2019re very rude. I\u2019m supposed to see how rudely you treat others and be okay with it. What\u2019s worse is that this is what you\u2019ve most stressed makes you town. <br>3) I\u2019m not allowed to call you out for how unhelpful you have been. You actively fought working with me, and others. Opting instead to make petty side arguments, threats, and ad hominems. Sometimes you did not even address other\u2019s arguments, because you were angry\u2026 the Irony. <br><br>But it\u2019s okay for you to do this because that\u2019s just how you play as town.<br><br>See my problem is that your whole defense relies on the fact that you got out of your way to be a horrible person as town. Given you go out of your way to do this, wouldn\u2019t it be super OB as scum when you are not making joke posts, or are not being overtly rude, or are actually working with others. Its already been established that you\u2019re pretty sly as scum, (ei not OB). So I imagine that you still pull the same crap as either alignment, and therefore I refuse to town read you for reasons one, two or three. You can respond to this if you want, but I\u2019m probably not going to reply. Mainly due to the fact that I know if I keep going I might lose my temper. And unlike some people I recognize that it isn\u2019t protown.</div></div></div>"}

Woe is me for comparing an individual to a standard. People never do that- oh wait <br><br>Pretty much everybody uses a standard when scums hunting to compare what players are doing to what they think typical scum and town behavior is. You\u2019re right I don\u2019t know anything about you, which is exactly why I\u2019m comparing you to a standard. I don\u2019t know you well enough to know what you do as one alignment or another, but I\u2019m not just going to take your word for it. Therefore I\u2019m using an ideal of what I think town, and scum would do, and compared things you did to that. It just so happens that your reactions to things look pretty scummy to me. And I\u2019m seeing nothing that screams town behavior to counter the scummy behavior. <br><br>From your perspective you\u2019re saying I shouldn\u2019t scum hunt a player whose meta I don\u2019t understand. By that logic you shouldn\u2019t be able to do proper scum hunting on me B/C you don\u2019t know anything about me. That is backwards logic. <br><br>While I could be wrong I really don\u2019t see what I could achieve if I did nothing, or just sheep other\u2019s thoughts. I wouldn\u2019t be making good use of my slot. Also, its p impossible to single out a play style as exclusively bad, everybody is right some day. And I think this is my day, and no berating from you is gonna change that. <br><blockquote><div><cite>House wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8099235#p8099235\" class=\"postlink\">post 839</a>, Grendel wrote:</cite>Surprise surprise son, look who is voting Vedith!

My gut instinct is Blank is town too. There was a lot of movement and stalling between the two wagons, to the point where it seemed like scum didn't care which one died, which implies Blank is town. I think if he were scum, we'd have seen less of a challenge on Blank's wagon and Vedith's wagon would have been piled on more earlier when Blank was faint lynch risk. I find on D1 scum tend to be preventative like that, rather than letting it get to a stage where they need to choose between bussing or deliberately voting a town over an under pressure scum."}

Also, I don't think House failed RQS. I think he did a typical House thing and answered just to humor you, see what you did with it, and evaluate. I know he didn't really follow up aton, but I think that's why he didn't take it seriously. The thing with Rob probably distracted him from it.<br><br>Blankface/hoopla probably isn't a team because Hoopla would probably be more likely to come it with a \"let's end the day and lynch vedith\" rather than switching up wagons.

He implies he's reading along and just not interested, but I don't see many people uninterested in giving reads so meh. Maybe I'm just trying to justify scumreading him to myself but I dunno. The whole \"this game sucks\" mentality and wanting to replace out felt town. Scum could sit back and let the game blow up. Which I guess to an extent he's done so meh.

Only thing is, if he's scum, he wants a mislynch. We already know Vedith was town. If Blankface was also town, scumWake would hate a mislynch just as much as townWake. I almost have to call it null. I'm also noting Hoopla doing the same.<br><br>House makes a good point about Hoopla and Wake being on the same page and avoiding interaction. Wake not being in Hoopla's so called town bloc is interesting with that in mind. Throw in the fact that Hoopla seemed to randomly exclude Masquarade from the Blank vs Vedith wagon thing earlier, then again on this Page (Post 729), and this very well could be the scum team (Hoopla/Wake/Masquarade). As much as I don't like Blankface's refusal to give any reads, that's probably my best guess at this point. Oh, I keep forgetting cmit too because he hasn't said much lately. Guess my \"too many town reads\" problem isn't such a big deal anymore. Strong town reads on Grendel, House, and Elyse is probably a good thing then.<br><br>Page 31:<br>I don't like Masquarade's reasoning for voting Vedith. He was scumreading Vedith earlier, so why not just point to that? Saying he wants momentum on the wagon and something to talk about rubs me the wrong way there.<br><br>Two issues with Wake on this page:<br>1) The reaction to Rob being JK feels fake. It's an unnecessary \"oh man we lost a power role\" type post and it reeks of trying to seem upset. The \"?\" to House gets lumped in with this reaction because of the \"what did I do\" feel it has to it. Like he knows he slipped up but doesn't know where.<br>2) The hesitance on voting after pushing everyone else to vote Vedith or Blankface feels like avoiding responsibility. It pushes both lynches, but doesn't show up on a VCA.<br><br>Page 32:<br>Hoopla's 780 might be scum hoping to wagon Blankface because the Vedith wagon didn't out a power role.

My issue there wasn't the vote itself, but the later explanation. Masquarade had Vedith as a scum read earlier. But why the switch to Blankface for being \"an ok lynch\"? I'd expect strong preference towards Vedith based on Masquarade's earlier posting. It's not consistent and the indifference is yet another reason to think that Masquarade is scum and Blankface is town.<br><br>Cmit, why unvote Vedith without voting Blankface?<br><br>Elyse's 824 is obvtown.<br><br>Page 34:<br>Wake, if you didn't want Vedith and Blankface pressured today, why were you encouraging people to pick one or the other to vote earlier?<br><br>Hmm.

I think if he were scum, we'd have seen less of a challenge on Blank's wagon and Vedith's wagon would have been piled on more earlier when Blank was faint lynch risk.

She was the engineer behind the Vedith vs BlankFace deathmatch and didn't seem to care which one died. This would be fine if she scumread both of them, but she thought Vedith's claim made him town.

My influence of funneling the votes onto Vedith and Blankface was an attempt to further the game by adding more pressure to slots that actually had a chance of being lynched, and then to reevaluate upon their wagons building and/or roleclaim -- these two to me seemed to have the greatest air of suspicion over them, so I went with that. <br><br>In hindsight, I regret not including Masquerade on this list too, but to achieve any meaningful information-yielding wagons, choosing more than two usually doesn't work as well.

In certain towns, channeling some manic energy to switch to an entirely new direction is sometimes possible, but there was no way this was happening in this town with so many people lurking. I will add, this whole deadline lynch scene is EXACTLY why I push for compromises on scumreads far earlier in the day than most, so we actually have time to switch once real information (wagons/claims) comes into the game. In the end we had to settle for a mediocre choose between two prob-townies, and it is true I didn't really care that much at that point."}

I imagine scum would be throwing Masq's hat into the ring too or at least stalling the Blank push/not allowing a Vedith vs. Blank duel to occur in the first place.<br><br>Why is the fact the Masq wagon happening today as opposed to yesterday concerning to you? It seems like the tide is turning in a pretty natural way post-D1 flips. The composition of this wagon looks town fueled, with perhaps one person suspecting Masq is in trouble and bussing early -- Egg most likely, as I'm reading Elyse as townish and BBmolla too. Although, I'd really like molla to do more this game, rather than coast on the defense I've given him so far.</div></blockquote>When I was reading and didn't know who was getting lynched, Vedith looked pretty much like a sure thing. Blankface never got any traction. I feel like there was never any serious competition to that wagon. And now folks have moved right onto Masq without any sort of countervailing sentiment. That feels like bussing/railroading to me. Maybe concerning is the wrong word, I just think it feels too easy especially after yesterday. Masq might just be bad town, Blank looks like classic scum coasting. I recognize it because when I used to play it was how my scum game would typically look."}

All of that, added with his weird reactions to the wagon yesterday have not changed my mind. He knows enough about this game that he doesn't get a newb pass.

He is the type of player that is very hard to read because their playstyle is generally anti-town and lacks any convincing \"honesty\" as to their motivations. I don't think your reasoning is bad except it feels that you have yet to connect for me why that makes him scum. Players like him are easy to write up but they could just be bad town players. Makes them good targets for players looking for an easy mislynch. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8136931#p8136931\" class=\"postlink\">post 962</a>, Grendel wrote:</cite>I'm gonna try something...<br><br>@Seraphim: You think I'm misguided town.

I don't even think misguided is necessarily the right word here. I think you are town because you are making a lot of posts, making a lot of opinions, throwing your weight behind them, and trying to get people lynched in a way that reflects an actual thought process and not a process that reflects a Mafia alignment. I was uncertain at first; your RQS felt kind of forced, but the way you handled it (even if I don't feel as if it has paid dividends) afterwards leads to believe you are town. <br><br>I am null-reading cmitc and town-reading Kill. My explanation above to BlankFace also applies here.

When you used it in that context, I did not like it as much and wanted to clarify what precisely I meant. It was a semantic choice if that makes any sense. I think the misguided/deceitful dichotomy that your question used made me want to use different words that were a little less loaded.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8138549#p8138549\" class=\"postlink\">post 979</a>, cmitc1 wrote:</cite>@Seraphim <br><br> #877 (still has not really made a case, all he said is that it is a gut feeling)   #879  #880  #884</div></blockquote>I want you to explain why the other posts are bad as well. This is like pulling teeth. It is also highly ironic that you accuse Masq of a \"gut\" feeling when you have given me even less information about why you think he is scum. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8139057#p8139057\" class=\"postlink\">post 988</a>, Masquerade wrote:</cite>I'd rather not discuss that rn.

There are a number of good reasons for town to know if you have a shot or not and the amount of information scum would gain from that information is negligible. In fact, I would not be sorry if you got hammered; when you are at L-1, you have lost your mindgame privileges."}

So, who is more likely to want that extra phase of being alive? Masquerade was under pressure at L-1 and forced to claim -- this claim is great to allow you to survive one more day, as towns will naturally want to test the claim and will back down. If Grendel is scum, what motivation does he have to counterclaim vig after just two votes on him now? He had a chance of being lynched today, but it was nowhere near a certainty even without claiming. <br><br>Grendel is either a vig, or he's making a strange counterclaim, when something like Cop or any other investigation role will work just as well (if not better). Occam's razor: I think Grendel has to be truthful here, as he was under less immediate pressure on his claim, as such, he has less incentive as scum to paint himself into a corner with his claim. Masquerade was already in a corner, so a vig fakeclaim makes more sense from him.<br><br>Now that I reason this out, I'm actually pretty confident of Masq-scum/Grendel-town, and really don't think Grendel does this as scum in this situation very often at all.

We will feel really dumb if we lynch the wrong one, but we will have the right one tomorrow and we don't fuck ourselves in the ass. I think it is almost guaranteed that scum are going to kill cmitc1 and block our real vig unless we lynch scum today. <br><br>I need to represent the reasoning abstractly. <span class=\"noboldsig\">REAL</span> will be my notation for the \"real\" one-shot vig, and <span class=\"noboldsig\">FAKE</span> for our fake vig.<br>REAL shoots FAKE<br><br>MAFIA can do one of the following:<br>1. block cmitc1 and kill REAL (unlikely as FAKE dies)<br>2. block REAL and shoot REAL (also unlikely as it implicates FAKE heavily)<br>3. block cmitc1 and shoot someone else, leaving REAL alive and FAKE dead (unlikely)<br>4. block REAL and shoot cmitc1, implicating cmitc1's target (most likely)<br><br>Lynching REAL, worst case scenario, means that we are in LYLO buuuuut we for sure have FAKE strung up tomorrow. However, if we gamble by lynching one of our claimed vigs today and choose correctly, Mafia will block and kill REAL allowing cmitc1 to get a shot off (which he should claim) or cmitc1 gets blocked, REAL gets a shot and gets shot, or cmitc1 gets killed and REAL gets blocked but regardless of the WIFOM I think leaving both alive only fucks us over. <br><br>I am of the opinion that we should lynch Masq between the two. Not only has Grendel acted more town, he has not been mysterious about his target or whether he has a shot. Also, if Grendel was scum, I think it is highly likely that he would have hammered Masq given his claim. He might have been able to sneak out of getting lynched tomorrow and trading himself for the vig would be fucking huge. I find the fact that Masq was not hammered to greatly increase the chances that he is in fact Mafia for this reason.<br><br>P-edit: So Hoopla has pretty much already said what I was thinking and took the time to type out and I 100% agree with her plan."}

After I sat down and thought about it, I came to the conclusion that you're probably town, but thanks for that post outlining your thought processes. Also, rereading the day's play, seeing Masquerade talk about being an alt of an experienced player makes me even more sure that claim was specifically designed to grant himself survival for one more phase -- hopefully this means he's the Roleblocker/Rolestopper.<br><br>As for targeting Killthestory -- I still think that slot is town, so I wouldn't shoot there, but I trust you to make your decision tonight. Although, I think you'll only be able to shoot if we lynch the scum RB today OR there's a scum RS and you shoot the RS specifically. For that reason, if we don't lynch mafia power today and the scum power is actually an RS, you shouldn't shoot Elyse as she's likely to be RS'ed again if they have one.<br><br>~~<br><br>Looking at the wagons today, I don't think there was a mafia plan overnight to double-bus Masquerade, because if there was, I think he'd claim something with more longterm survival value than 1-shot Vig. For this reason, I believe there was scum pushing cmitc and other wagons, and once you remove Grendel from the equation, Blankface is the key candidate here.<br><br>Imo, the scumteam is Masq/Blank with one of my early townreads being wrong:<br><br>- Elyse fits if scum has a Rolestopper. <br>- Molla fits too as an early distancing vote for Masq today, but also keeping open a possibility to switch to cmitc. This means I was wrong about my meta read on him early, but when you weigh it against his entire game doing nothing but happily basking in my town read on him, it wouldn't be that much of a mindfuck. <br>- House was still posting sitewide after his replacement, and I hate to speculate on replacement reasons, but it's way more likely he replaces out of this game as town than as scum who are crushing it. He was also really town regardless of this tell, and killthestory's joking about and not reading the game just seems like annoying town -- scum usually aren't so brazen about not caring to contribute to the game.<br>- Egg could still fit, but I'm a sucker for brutally honest town talking about their scumhunting inadequacies and volunteering to be lynched. Seems pretty town.<br>- Seraphim is a possibility for the one scum not fueling the Masq wagon if it isn't Blank (he did jump on later when it was obvious it was a Masq lynch today), but I think he has been quite protown in his motivations today and usually when I find people mirroring my thoughts about the game, it is a good sign.<br><br>My guess for the third is Molla based on today's play and I think the reason why I haven't been reconsidering him as a possibility is because I really wanted him to be town because I wanted Rob to be wrong. Without that one tell, he'd be pretty scummy in my eyes.<br><br>Masquerade<br>Blank or Sera (80/20)<br>Molla or Elyse (depends on the scum power)<br><br>That's pretty much the way I see it right now."}

Presumably, it was someone on the Masq wagon given how fast it grew. Based on what has occurred since, I am fairly confident the third member of the team is Elyse. <br><br>Scumteam is Elyse and BlankFace. <br>BlankFace, nothing has changed. Folks should refer to my past posting history.<br>Elyse is the busser on the Masq wagon. One or two line posts. Not a ton of content. Voted Hoopla before voting Masq yesterday, then voted Masq, and is back on the train for...what again? For something about the Mafia PR which certainly exists? Also for being skeptical of Molla's unconfirmable neighbor claim? I would be skeptical too if Hoopla hadn't already gone through the motions. She should be tomorrow's lynch after we lynch BlankFace.<br><br>If Hoopla was scum, I would be very shocked. Masq was almost successful in derailing his lynch for a day and given the nature of the claim, I highly doubt that he had planned it out beforehand with his partners; otherwise, he would have claimed something safer. Yet Hoopla decides that the best course of action is to lynch Masq who turned out to be scum. Like Grendel, I think her actions put her in the right place, right time, where a scum player could have gotten the win in. A Hoopla lynch is a terrible course of action. <br><br>I also doubt molla is lying unless someone counterclaims which I highly doubt will happen. No way scum could have guessed that cmitc1 would have chosen molla for sure and gambled a no-kill against it. Worst case scenario, no one is killed last night and we have masons running around. Nasty. Nah, scum probably just decided to kill an investigative role, consequences be damned. <br><br>I am convinced that Grendel, Hoopla, and BBMolla are all town for sure. Egg can hang out adjacent to this pile as well. <br>I am not as sure on KTS but their play looks, from where I am standing, way more town than either of the aforementioned players. House/KTS might be scum but I sort of doubt it. If they were and I was their scum partner, I would be infuriated with their play. <br><br>Grendel: I'm fairly convinced that scum was going to kill cimtc1 and block you no matter what you said in thread. <br>Elyse: can you explain in detail precisely why you are voting Hoopla currently? <br>killthestory: I don't care if you read the game or not before you replaced in, but I would be pretty pumped if scumhunted based on what has happened since you joined up. Who do you think is Mafia and why? <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: BlankFace</span>"}

Earlier in the day, I was again influential in his wagon being promoted.

Elyse offers piecemeal observations like this about Masq:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8120366#p8120366\" class=\"postlink\">post 883</a>, Elyse wrote:</cite>Yeah that was pretty fake.<br><br>Masq is a good vote. I'll explain my Hoopla scumread later when I get on a computer.</div></blockquote><br><br>This is Elyse giving lip service to the Masq wagon unfolding while she primarily spends the start of D1 dropping mega-posts like <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8120507#p8120507\" class=\"postlink\">885</a> about me. She eventually yields to the Masquerade wagon after I've pushed it to three votes:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8124234#p8124234\" class=\"postlink\">post 913</a>, Elyse wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Masquerade</span><br><br>More comfortable with this. Still think Hoopla could be scum but she makes the most sense with Masquerade and brings up a good point about no one else including him in the wagons.</div></blockquote><br><br>Suddenly she's more comfortable with this? What changed? The only thing that changed was the tide turning towards Masq, and I find it strange she is sheeping my opinions about Masq and buddying with me when I am her primary suspect. If my idea about Masq-scum is such a good point, that she is nodding along with her scum-read (me) and agreeing with it, how can she say my handling of the Masq lynch was strange when I was a key player in getting it achieved?<br><br>~~<br><br>I'm not as slam-dunk on Blankface/Elyse as Seraphim is, as I think Sera is occasionally scum instead of Blankface and is buddying my reads knowing I'll take the fall for a hypothetical Blank-town mislynch. This would actually be a good scum play on his part. I tend to think he is earnest though, and realistically, the best chance of town winning this game is through cooperation with him as it's definitely possible this is town-Sera here, and if he is, we'll be hard to stop.<br><br>I also think there are possibilities of molla, Egg or KTS scumteams, but their play just really makes more sense as town and picking any of them for the lynch seems like a left-field gamble steeped in conspiracy theories, and I'm certain there's never more than one scum here (but usually zero).<br><br>Playing the percentages, I'm inclined to believe Blank/Elyse is the most likely scumteam too. Blankface is the better lynch today as the scum not on Masq's wagon has fewer possible candidates, while there's a couple other players who could feasibly be bussing-scum, although I think Elyse's reluctant bussing (as depicted in this post) is the most likely scumbag on that wagon.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Blankface</span>"}

So, who is more likely to want that extra phase of being alive? Masquerade was under pressure at L-1 and forced to claim -- this claim is great to allow you to survive one more day, as towns will naturally want to test the claim and will back down. If Grendel is scum, what motivation does he have to counterclaim vig after just two votes on him now? He had a chance of being lynched today, but it was nowhere near a certainty even without claiming. <br><br>Grendel is either a vig, or he's making a strange counterclaim, when something like Cop or any other investigation role will work just as well (if not better). Occam's razor: I think Grendel has to be truthful here, as he was under less immediate pressure on his claim, as such, he has less incentive as scum to paint himself into a corner with his claim. Masquerade was already in a corner, so a vig fakeclaim makes more sense from him.<br><br>Now that I reason this out, I'm actually pretty confident of Masq-scum/Grendel-town, and really don't think Grendel does this as scum in this situation very often at all.

Then once there was evidence of a role blocker introduced (via Cmitc1\u2019s cliam) Hoopla interjected with the idea that there could be a role stopper. Then she uses the possibility of a role stopper to work up a scum read on Elyse. When it was most likely that Cmitc1 was just role blocked. Looking back, his desire to know about mass claiming could have made the mafia suspect him to be a PR of some sort. So role blocking Cmitc1 makes more sense. Also since I was unable to perform a night kill last night my guess is that there is a role blocker, not a role stopper.<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8145753#p8145753\" class=\"postlink\">post 1085</a>, Hoopla wrote:</cite>Analysing which vig claim is real: <br><br>For the most part it's unusual for scum to fakeclaim vig, as this really only buys you one more night before you get lynched -- that's all this claim does. So, who is more likely to want that extra phase of being alive? Masquerade was under pressure at L-1 and forced to claim -- this claim is great to allow you to survive one more day, as towns will naturally want to test the claim and will back down. If Grendel is scum, what motivation does he have to counterclaim vig after just two votes on him now? He had a chance of being lynched today, but it was nowhere near a certainty even without claiming. <br><br>Grendel is either a vig, or he's making a strange counterclaim, when something like Cop or any other investigation role will work just as well (if not better). Occam's razor: I think Grendel has to be truthful here, as he was under less immediate pressure on his claim, as such, he has less incentive as scum to paint himself into a corner with his claim. Masquerade was already in a corner, so a vig fakeclaim makes more sense from him.<br><br>Now that I reason this out, I'm actually pretty confident of Masq-scum/Grendel-town, and really don't think Grendel does this as scum in this situation very often at all.

Claiming that Cmitc1 died because he targeted scum when there were no other night kills to back this up seems just like what I would expect scum to do. Is there a possibility that Cmitc1 targeted scum, AND was the mafia\u2019s factional kill? Sure, but I\u2019m not open to entertaining that possibility right now."}

Grendel is obviously town so that needs no explanation.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Hoopla</span> has echoed my thoughts on the game several times. Her accusation that Egg is floating by giving \"content\" is absolutely dead-on as is her increasing paranoia over BBMolla being scum for not posting any content after her initial townread on him. It mirrored the exact same progression of read that I had on Molla, going from town for ATE -&gt; maybe scum for lack of content or scumhunting -&gt; probably town for how he revealed that he was in the neighborhood. Her play around the Masquerade wagon was actually ridiculously town. It didn't seem like she already knew Masq's alignment and was trying to look the best from it. Rather, it looked to me like she was genuinely trying to figure her out. Take for example <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8140778#p8140778\">Post 1010</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8140780#p8140780\">Post 1011</a>. If she were scum with Masq, she'd know that it would make her look absolutely horrendous once Masq flips. She'd know that Masq has a short shelf life so she would be planning all her moves around the Masq flip. Hoopla certainly wouldn't have any delusions of taking Masq with her to endgame. Given that, I think Hoopla would bus here but the fact that she took such a risk and instead tries to kickstart an Egg wagon makes her way more likely to be town. Hoopla's play has consistently revolved around taking the optimal strategy in any given situation rather than follow her reads and has many times stated that she lacks confidence in her reads. From the standpoint of a player like Hoopla, not lynching Masq at this point is the better play purely based on numbers. Because then a hypothetical town-Masq could bring us back to an odd number of players, and if she's scum, that would be confirmed the next day. It makes zero sense for Hoopla to jump in there and put herself at risk of lynch simply to save a buddy for another day. That's exactly what happened. Masq flipped scum and Hoopla looked absolutely horrible from a superficial standpoint. But following Hoopla's thought process, it makes perfect sense to me. Then after Grendel claimed, it made more sense to lynch Masq and Hoopla correctly pushed it. In fact, I think we should be looking more at the people who weren't giving due consideration to the possibility of a Masq-townflip because they're going for maximum cred. There are too many of those so I'll be analyzing all of this in my next few posts after I breakdown the cases against Hoopla.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">KTS</span> is probably town for his easygoing, devil-may-care style and I also like his not taking the bait and jumping on the major wagons, voting Elyse instead. I wouldn't bet anything on it though.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">BBMolla</span> is more likely town than not but I really want to see him get into the game and contribute actual scumhunting thoughts.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Blankface:</span> I still think Masquerade's jump onto Blankface on D1 makes him more likely town but that's a tenuous reason and I think he fits with Elyse as a partner.

I see it  more as Hoopla being cautious and covering her bases since Masq was at L-1 before Egg unvoted and you had already stated intent to hammer in few hours. Hoopla could always revote Masquerade if she still thought Masq was scum after thinking it through so I see the unvote as pro-town and not scummy at all. It seemed she unvoted to give Masq time to claim without being hammered at any second before she could come back to claim.<br><br>2) Masq claimed 1X vig and there was only one kill on night one. It seems reasonable to wonder if Masq was saving his shot for a later day. While it's entirely possible for a hypothetical town-Masq to have shot the same target as the scum, the odds are much lower than the probability that Masq was holding onto the shot for later use. Hoopla enquiring about it seemed like a way to make the most optimal move. One thing I think you should realize is that <span style=\"font-style: italic\">you knew Masq was scum as soon as he claimed vig.</span> He claimed your role. But from Hoopla's standpoint, having no idea whether Masq was scum fake-claiming or whether we had just run up the town vig, the logical choice was to wait and see if it was confirmable and play it safe. This style matches up with the rest of Hoopla's play in this game like pushing D1 lynches based on compromise as opposed to her reads. It shows that she's not ultra-confident in her own reads, so how can we expect her to suddenly be confident enough in a Masq scumread to say \"to hell with a vig claim, you are dying today!\" Hoopla's logic is actually fairly standard when dealing with claims. The harm from lynching a town vig outweigh the harm of delaying a scum lynch by a day. If scum get run up and claim PR, the best move is to leave them aside and continue scumhunting elsewhere since there are still other scum to catch.<br><br>3) Clearly Hoopla was likely wrong about there not being a roleblocker. I don't think her logic was too far out there. Mods dislike using roleblockers when there are other roleblocking roles out there because they make night actions confusing and she backed that up with stats from past games. That we winded up with a likely roleblocker here doesn't make her scum. Her rolestopper speculation made sense to me at the time I read it and it being wrong doesn't make her more likely scum than town throwing our random ideas on what the setup could be to help solve the game.<br><br>4) Whatever BBMolla's alignment, consider what he did in this game. I'm <span style=\"font-style: italic\">beyond stunned</span> that he has 130 posts because I barely remember a single thing he said or read he pushed. When he got an early wagon on him, he melted down completely and got townread and the wagon went away. Then he parked his vote on Vedith for the rest of the day until the very end where he switched to Blankface. D2, all of a sudden, from nowhere, he started pushing Masq. Here's something I would really appreciate you doing and letting me know what you think: ISO BBMolla. Ctrl+F \"Masq.\" Let me know what you see. You'll see on day one a single quote from Masq (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8068585#p8068585\">Post 326</a>) where BBMolla agrees with Masquerade. The second time BBMolla mentions Masquerade is during D2 in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8113882#p8113882\">Post 858</a> where he naked-votes her. Where's the read progression? It looks like he pulled that read out of thin air. Then all he does is repeat that he wants Masquerade lynched: <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8113882#p8113882\" class=\"postlink\">post 858</a>, BBmolla wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Masquerade</span></div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8127931#p8127931\" class=\"postlink\">post 926</a>, BBmolla wrote:</cite>lynch masquerade</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8138384#p8138384\" class=\"postlink\">post 975</a>, BBmolla wrote:</cite>I don't know where the other scum are, I just really think its masquerade for today.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8141129#p8141129\" class=\"postlink\">post 1015</a>, BBmolla wrote:</cite>can we just lynch masquerade</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8146491#p8146491\" class=\"postlink\">post 1106</a>, BBmolla wrote:</cite>I still think masq is scum and don't know partner nor care for today</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8146540#p8146540\" class=\"postlink\">post 1116</a>, BBmolla wrote:</cite>I just want masq to die</div></blockquote><br><br>He doesn't give a single reason why.

So, I don't see Hoopla's suspicion of BBMolla as scum-indicative at all."}

I also think you are underrating keeping Masq alive. We were in MyLo with one more mislynch and if one townie voted another townie, bam the game could be over like that. Hoopla took a risk. Plus if Masq was planning this elaborate claim and such, I'd expect at least one buddy to go along with it. Because otherwise what's the point? He claims vig and goes down anyway? Someone needs to give him the benefit of the doubt to give him some sort of foothold. I think Hoopla attempted to do that but everything backfired when Grendel claimed and Masq was stuck."}

And that is exactly what Hoopla did.

Also, in mylo, you need two town to vote another town, not one. While that doesn't take away from the thrust of your point, I think it mitigates it. I just find it hard to believe that with an inactive Masquerade who couldn't string together two town-looking posts to save her life, and been forced into claiming a role where her lynch is assured the next day, a very experienced and decently skilled player like Hoopla dives right in and defends her in a double-or-nothing play.<br><br>A large part of why I suspect you is that I find your reasoning for Hoopla-scum in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8159255#p8159255\">Post 1161</a> very weak.

I also don't get how you didn't realize that scum roleblocking Grendel is the smart move regardless of whether his target was town or scum. With an even number of players, if Grendel killed a townie that was widely suspected, it still benefits town.

Judging solely from her play this game I would say that Hoopla doesn't seem like the kind of scum player to be quick to bus her partners. So I could definitely see her hoping to salvage Mask at least one more day. I do think that that unvote was indicative of wanting to see if she could save Mask (Which makes more sense as scum since as you pointed out- Mask did not have two town posts to rub together), and she led the reasoning that Mask could use his shot to clear himself tomorrow. The thing about that is with Cmitc1 confirming there being a role blocker it seems like she would recant the plan to clear Mask via shooting right then and there since he would be blocked if he were a vigilante. Instead of moving back to interrogate Mask however, she jumped on me in post 1052. At that point Mask would no longer be confirmable, so why was she interested in trying to lynch a new target? I am not seeing the town intent from that. <br><br>I was unaware that scum had day talk. In the thread proper Hoopla still claimed Mask had a shot if he did not say anything otherwise, and Mask went along with it. I am not sure how you could see anything else from that???<br><br>I generally do not use set up speculation as a reason to scum read somebody, but considering how, and when things fell into place I could see definite scum motivation behind Hoopla's speculation. Is it could be a reasonable thing to speculate since multiple role blockers are not common when she talked me out of my role blocker counters. I'd say that being wrong here still falls into null. Then though, she introduced the idea of the role stopper in post 1094 which looked like diverting attention away from the role blocker threat. Which means she tried undermining the possibility of a role blocker twice, and the second time looks pretty scummy to me. <br><br>Yes, I am taking nieghborized BBmolla at face value right now. I have acknowledged a possibility that cmitc1 was both the factional kill target, and targeted scum, before. But I decided to keep myself from second guessing I would keep to what I predicted scum's play would be today, and assume that who ever Cmitc visited from his town pool would be town if hoopla, or whoever, tried theorizing that Cmitc visted mafia. If nobody pointed out that our neighborized player could be scum, (or at least later into the day), then I think it most likely that Cmitc1 had visted Scum and not town. But Hoopla's quickness in discrediting BBmolla makes her look like scum to me this day start. It was literally the second thought of the day she began pressing, and the first just being a question to me."}

Egg replaces into the game and makes a giant catchup post most of which are points against his buddy capping it off with a vote at the end.

I wouldn't mind having one less game to play. I want Grendel's input on Cmit's claim though.</div></blockquote><br><br>Egg mentioned that he played over 300 games (I'm not sure if that was in this game or in a game I was reading but I'm sure he'll confirm this). He's smart enough to know that suggesting a lynch on oneself is abundantly stupid. I don't think he would do it as town and if he has done it, he's welcome to show me a link. Besides that, having \"one less game to play\" is a ridiculously weak reason to suggest a lynch on himself and doesn't sound genuine at all. Town are much more likely to want to be lynched when they are frustrated by being scumread and have a strong scumread they want dead with the hope that when people see their townflip, they'll lynch their scumread. \"Lynch me, I'm overgamed\" is not something a guy with 300 games under his belt would do.<br><br>On the other hand, Egg has <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5242396#p5242396\" class=\"postlink\">self-voted</a> as scum before and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5247493#p5247493\" class=\"postlink\">called for his lynch.</a> <br><br>I think he threw out that little suggestion because he thought it would get him towncred. The fact that Egg is not above using fake towntells as scum is another reason I don't weigh his thinking you had a cop guilty on cmitc1 very strongly.

Here's the essence of how it went:<br><br><ul><li>Grendel asked a bunch of RQS questions three of which are \"what are your strengths,\" \"what are your weaknesses,\" and \"do your strengths and weaknesses change with alignment?\"</li><li>Masq responded to them in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8060404#p8060404\">Post 138</a> with \"I don't really know,\" \"I get emotional and it shows,\" and \"Sort of.\"</li><li>Eggs asks \" How do you know your strengths and weaknesses change without knowing what your strengths are?\" Right away, I find this a stretch. Masquerade could easily have been referring to just her weaknesses given she didn't really answer the \"strengths\" part.</li><li>Her response in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8065271#p8065271\">Post 265</a> confirms this and she explains that she gets more emotional as town because she's apparently the one being betrayed. Clearly, this changes with alignment.</li></ul>The entire Masq-case is Egg making a huge stretch out of Masq answering non-alignment indicative RQS questions about herself. Adding onto that, he uses a lot of dubious theory to back up his reasoning in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8063553#p8063553\">Post 227</a> to refute Robb's point that Masq may simply have not wanted to give away her scum meta regardless of her alignment. It reads like he knew what he was doing with the Masq-push and that he'd look good for it more than actually trying to read her.<br><br>After all this, he fades out and returns to say that he \"supported\" the Vedith pressure in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8076890#p8076890\">Post 421</a> and votes Vedith because \"deadline\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8097512#p8097512\">Post 816</a>. He never gives any reason for this at all. His only other mention of Vedith on D1 is all the way back in his first post where he calls Vedith town for his reaction to the Hoopla townblock. More notably, when he said \"deadline\" and voted Vedith, Blankface had five votes on him and Vedith had two, so if deadline was his reason, he would have voted Blankface. Instead, he gives off the indication that he had Blankface as an actual townread asking what the Blankface wagon was about. All this is on page 33. What reads as most disingenous here though is when he does another huge catchup at the beginning of D2, he starts agreeing with your continued case on Blankface and saying that he had too many townreads and Blankface wasn't one of them. So, if Blankface wasn't a townread, why would he vote Vedith who had only two votes over Blankface who had five with \"deadline\" as the reason?<br><br>His reasons for scumreading Hoopla over the Masq lynch makes no sense as he behaved similarly. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8140059#p8140059\">Post 994</a>, he states that he'll unvote if Masq claims to still have the shot which is basically Hoopla's position as well. Yet, he agrees with your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8169161#p8169161\">Post 1200</a> where you accuse Hoopla of doing pretty much the same thing Egg did like missing the obvious signs that Masq was lying, and voting other players (Egg had voted both Cmitc1 and Hoopla while the Masq claim shenanigans were happening). If he had similar doubts about Masq, why would he push on Hoopla for having them?<br><br>Finally, look at his latest play D3. After Hoopla claims, he waffles around the claim, and questions that it could be town yet keeps his vote on Hoopla while also being \"tempted\" to vote Blankface because of the replacement. Aside from it being dumb to vote someone for replacing out, he isn't actually doing anything to read and analyze either player. When I call him out, he gets beetlejuiced into the thread eight minutes after I post and when I don't respond, he disappears again. This is coasting scum who is very happy with the gamestate as is. He made a convincing bus D2 and is assured a mislynch today which will put the game at mylo and that's it.<br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:75%\"></div><br>This guy needs votes on him.

For town it was probably still pointless, but could have helped.<br><br>Your point:<br>Trying too hard to \"show work\"<br><br>My response:<br>You are apparently very familiar with my meta so it shouldn't surprise you that I tend to be very transparent as town and try to appear the same way as scum<br><br>Your point:<br>I was tying people to Masq when I voted Masq<br><br>My response:<br>Nah, if anything I tied Hoopla and Wake and then tied Hoopla to Masq after Masq's flip. I don't like to tunnel on just one person. I'm looking for the whole scum team or at least the scummiest players Days 1 and 2. Hoopla and Wake interacted in ways that looked scum/scum, but I was more confident Masq was scum so that's where I voted. You'll also notice I raised the point that Chaos was a weird kill but he suspected Masq and the rest of his reads were similar to mine. That still stands out to me and is a big reason why I haven't changed my reads much.<br><br>Your point:<br>My offer to be lynched isn't a towntell and looks like an emotional appeal<br><br>My response:<br>I concede that it's something I'd do as scum for a combination of town points and genuine dislike of mafia. However, I deal with real emotion all the time as town too. I really want to be in 0 games, but every time games end people ask me to join another and I suck at saying no. Not wanting to play has been a common theme for me for quite a while. Same with being too busy to play.<br><br>Your point:<br>I might be scum with Elyse<br><br>My response:<br>If I die, this becomes irrelevant. If Elyse dies and flips town, same thing. If Elyse dies and flips scum while I'm still alive, I'll address this. But for now, it's pointless.<br><br>Your point:<br>I had a townread on Elyse<br><br>My response:<br>True. PoE would probably be the only reason I'd see to vote Elyse. It crossed my mind when Hoopla claimed VT, but nothing in her play looks like scum to me. Her suspicion of BBMolla looked genuine too.<br><br>Your point:<br>I was passive and casual while voting Masq<br><br>My response:<br>I was busy and behind in all of my games. Null<br><br>Your point:<br>I bus as scum except when I don't<br><br>My response:<br>I'm right as town except when I'm not. Seriously the fact that I've bussed before doesn't mean that I'm scum every time I vote scum. To be fair though, you said the only thing it shows is that my Masq vote isn't a reason to town read me and I can't disagree with that. What I'd challenge people to do is read my ISO in that game just like you suggest and see how every chance I get I'm attacking Newbie. Every chance I get, I'm showing what obvscum my scumbuddy is. I didn't act that way towards Masq. I found a few points and stuck to them. My case, while right, wasn't nearly as strong as that one was. And if you open the scum PT from that game, you'll see that I replaced in and singlehandedly turned around a disaster of a game for scum (of course Titus helped later on too). Here, I think everyone will agree it would be shocking to see a similarity in any scum PT I'd be part of. My play there is almost exact opposite from here in almost every way except that I voted scum.<br><br>Your point:<br>Suggesting a lynch on myself is stupid<br><br>My response:<br>*shrug*. My intelligence has been insulted so many times on this site that maybe you're right and I'm just an idiot. But like I said, I don't enjoy this game anymore. I really don't. It was a selfish comment. I'll admit that. But sitting here arguing with people on my phone and hearing how dumb I am is a big part of why I want to have very little to do with this site. I like the fantasy football league, but that's about it. But if you think you're smarter than me, *shrug*, what can I say? Maybe you're right. If not, I don't even care frankly. I still intend to find a link by the way.<br><br>Your point:<br>Thinking Grendel had a guilty on cmit is faking a town tell<br><br>My response:<br>See, I'm not usually one to show why things I do are town. I usually let people figure that out on their own. But here, I'll make an exception because it feels obvious to me and you aren't seeing it (still not sure if it's intentional or not). I don't see any way I'd come up with that out of the blue as scum. I mean, I think it's obvious that \"looking for power roles\" is usually seen as scummy. I didn't expect town points for that. I didn't care how I was read for it and actually expected some suspicion. So, that in mind, it only makes sense to say it if I genuinely thought Grendel was a cop. And you can argue that I intended to NK him and that's why I went all \"tell me how confident you are\" and \"should I sheep you?\". Like it makes sense as scum rolefishing. But here's the catch. Me trying to determine whether Grendel has a guilty on cmit as scum requires cmit to actually be scum. Cmit was town. So why bother doing it as scum? It isn't something that looks town because it can come off as rolefishing (i've shown it obviously wasn't) so it's not for town points. And I can't be scum who thinks he has a guilty because cmit wasn't town. So why do it? And if your arguement is that it's to make this exact post, you think I'm psychic because I knew you'd replace in and question me on it all the way on Day 3 and I'd wait until then to address it.<br><br>Your point:<br>Following up on the previous one, you mentioned that I was apparently trying to appear uninformed on cmit's alignment<br><br>My response:<br>So we're going with the point that I'm psychic. Otherwise, why wasn't that brought up until now? You've got to realize this is a stretch<br><br>Your point:<br>My Masq push was bad<br><br>My response:<br>I disagree obviously.<br><br>Your point:<br>I should have voted Blank at deadline over Vedith<br><br>My response:<br>I asked for the Blank case. no one gave it. House even openly refused. So I voted Vedith so was actually scummy over Blank who I had no info on. You mention that it was 5-2 when I voted. I was unaware of the vote count if I'm remembering correctly.<br><br>Your point:<br>I'm uninvolved as scum<br><br>My response:<br>Nope. That depends on real life, not alignment. You appear to have picked and chosen games to fit your narrative.<br><br>Your point:<br>My being uninvolved here is different from adventure mafia because that was a bigger and faster game<br><br>My response:<br>Both this game and that one were going on at the same time. There, I was about to be lynched just for being busy so I put that game above this one on my priority list. So pages and pages building up in that game directly impacted my activity here.<br><br>Your point:<br>Hating mafia is different from not wanting to play it<br><br>My response:<br>Nuh-uh<br><br>Your point:<br>My calling you and hoopla is fake<br><br>My response:<br>No, I've been saying that for quite a while, not just when you voted me."}

You actually did tie Hoopla and Masquerade together pre-flip. This happened in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8122317#p8122317\">Post 901</a>. I also don't follow how Hoopla and Wake interacted in a way that looking scum-scum, simply by posting on the same page but not interacting with each other. Besides, that's not an original thought. You ripped it off of House.<br><br>2. The problem with your play around Grendel and cmit is that if you thought Grendel was a cop with a guilty, there was no reason to ask any questions or try to get further information if you are town. Masquerade was the most likely lynch and if Grendel truly was the cop, he would have claimed at some point to divert it to cmit. That he didn't claim in his first post of the day means that he was probably looking for interactive tells before he outed. There's no way a cop with a guilty doesn't eventually claim so nothing was needed from your end.<br><br>3. Your Masq push was bad because you were using perfectly null tells to paint her in a scummy light. Two instances of this are a) her answer \"sort of\" could easily have applied to just her weakness but you stretched it to mean that she had hidden strengths that she didn't want to talk about, and b) even if she wanted to hide her strengths as scum, it's perfectly acceptable to not want to reveal your scum meta regardless of alignment but you ignore that entirely and shoehorn it as her being scum which reads to me as inside knowledge that she is indeed scum.<br><br>4. Saying \"I hate mafia\" is perfectly acceptable outlet for frustration that doesn't interfere with your wincon. But self-voting or suggesting that you be lynched does, and while I can see newbies doing the latter as town, I have a hard time believing a player with your level of experience would make that suggestion. So, when you get a chance, I'd really appreciate seeing the links to where you did this as town.<br><br>With that said, you have me second-guessing my read on you with this response so I'm going to reset and try and re-read the game from a different perspective tomorrow."}

I hardly think I have a solid grasp on the game and this post sends all kinds of alarms especially since the entirety of your interaction with me has been cheerleading from the sidelines as opposed to offer any sort of opinions or content. Is this normal play for you as town? Can you link me to games where you were mislynched or were on the brink of being mislynched? I'd also like to see a game where you took the backseat and just went with the reads of another player who you thought had a better handle on the game.<br><br>2) I have a hard time buying that your townread on BBMolla at the end of D3 in fifty page long game with over five weeks of playtime amounts to \"he had an emotional meltdown\" on page seven a couple of days after the game started. You have stated paranoia of him for just coasting on the townread you gave him but it's concerning that you never followed up on that line of thought. On your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8167320#p8167320\">Post 1188</a>, there isn't much thought required to claim that he was neighborized and to summarize cmitc's posts in the neighborhood PT. That's a pretty weak reason for it to have assuaged your concerns about BBMolla's lack of scumhunting. Mind going over it in more detail so I can see if there's more depth to it?<br><br>3) If you are town here, I'd like to avoid mislynching but as it turns out, you are the concensus scumread and you not nothing has made me second-guess my townread on you considerably. Especially given you seem happy to post in the Open Setup Review thread which shows you have enough time to spare for mafia-related activities. This is also at odds with typical town behavior where players about to be lynched want to get as much information and reads out there as possible. In fact, it fits with the scum motivation of trying to minimize interactive tells and going down quietly once they see the writing on the wall. Assuming you are town, I really need something from you, hopefully a massive wall of content with in-depth and updated reads."}

As for whether this is normal for me or not, it's hard to say. I think it's slowly starting to become a pattern for me and a part of why I don't play mafia anymore -- I just cannot generate same amount of zeal and fire to crush games with brute force analysis like I once could, and it ends up with me being apathetic, because I know it takes a lot of energy to change people's minds and put the dots together in late game, and I just cannot do it and fall into an existential tailspin.

Judging solely from her play this game I would say that Hoopla doesn't seem like the kind of scum player to be quick to bus her partners. So I could definitely see her hoping to salvage Mask at least one more day. I do think that that unvote was indicative of wanting to see if she could save Mask (Which makes more sense as scum since as you pointed out- Mask did not have two town posts to rub together), and she led the reasoning that Mask could use his shot to clear himself tomorrow. The thing about that is with Cmitc1 confirming there being a role blocker it seems like she would recant the plan to clear Mask via shooting right then and there since he would be blocked if he were a vigilante. Instead of moving back to interrogate Mask however, she jumped on me in post 1052. At that point Mask would no longer be confirmable, so why was she interested in trying to lynch a new target?

The first game I looked at re-affirmed my suspicions that he was bussing Masquerade.

Egg replaces into the game and makes a giant catchup post most of which are points against his buddy capping it off with a vote at the end. Egg's partner wasn't under much pressure at all and the wagon was started by Egg. The stark similarity between that and his push on Masquerade here in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8063395#p8063395\">Post 208</a> should nullify the reasons anyone is townreading him.

In fact, his push on Masquerade was based on very nebulous reasoning and him winding up being right at the end fits much more with an informed perspective than town that genuinely found scum. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Solidly confident Egg is scum here and I'd like everyone to engage me on this read.</span> <br><br>Egg tying Hoopla to Masquerade pre-flip also makes more sense from scum tying his partner to the townie he wants to lynch next to set her up.

I normally hate bussing but in some games I have to do it. I don't think looking at one game is a strong enough reason to completely abandon my reason for townreading Egg. Hoopla's \"let's let Masq shoot and prove himself\" reads much more as what scum would do to me than Egg's early vote on Masq.<br><br>Re your points in 1323:<br><br>1. I understand what you're saying here. Egg was trying to push Masq-scum to make himself look good and used weak reasoning to do so. But for me the timing is still off. It was so early in the game and didn't lead to anything. He didn't get any credit for doing it. I just think the risks outweigh the benefits so early on.<br><br>2. This is a decent point if Egg is scum with BlankFace. But one major reason I personally stayed on Vedith was because he already claimed at that point and I thought it was unnecessary to force a claim out of BlankFace if I was fine with either of the two wagons.<br><br>3. Egg wanted to let Masq confirm his shot before Grendel claimed, so I don't have much of an issue with that. I also found it very town of him to vote for Hoopla when Hoopla and kts voted for Grendel right before deadline. Egg could have so easily went with them and said \"deadline\" but didn't. <br><br>4. Yeah his play today hasn't been spectacular. I agree there. But besides yours, no one's has. The game kind of went stale and I could see frustration being a reason for his \"tempted to lynch BlankFace\" post because it took even more momentum out of the game.<br><br>Why do you think it could be BB as Egg's partner now?

Therefore either Elyse and Hoopla are scum together or Elyse is confbiasing and looking for more to be convincing. <br><br>I don't see a world where Hoopla scum and Elyse town because then Hoopla would have countered saying he wasn't being scummy when Elyse brought up the point in 1200. <br><br>I think 1200 is pretty damning for Hoopla and Elyse.</div></blockquote><br>This is just ridiculous.<br><br>First of all why are you saying you're gonna vote Hoopla if you can't see Hoopla scum and me-town? <br><br>You keep bringing up 1200 and saying I should have brought up Hoopla's scumminess during the Masq lynch. Why would I do that before Masq flipped? I brought it up the very next day. So did Egg. So did Grendel. It seems as though your \"tells\" could point to all three of us.<br><br>In your mind, what's stopping an Egg/Hoopla team?<br><br>This looks to me like you're bussing Hoopla and trying to bring me down with her.<br><br>p-edit: so why not vote me?"}

If that's the scumteam, then Egg has done some very good distancing tying both his partners together. The reason I haven't ruled it out is that Egg's opportunistic tying of Wake (my slot) and Hoopla based simply on them posting on the same page and not interacting. House was the one who brought up that weak reasoning and Egg jumped on it. Regardless, it's a possibility that shouldn't be discounted as those are the sort of moves that win scumgames.<br><br>Haven't ruled out Hoopla/BBMolla either. Hoopla wagoning him up early game so he can fake a bit of ATE gives her an excuse to townread him which seemingly lasted for three whole game days. As for trying to unconfirm BBMolla as town, why wouldn't she? It's not like BBMolla absolutely needs the faux-confirmation from cmit in order to survive and Hoopla's play serves to solidly distance them so that if one flips, the other is assured a win. Hoopla also put in extra effort in trying to discredit Robb's BBMolla read by pointing out all the times that Robb was wrong, and in general making him look stupid. It didn't look like it served an in-game purpose but if Robb was onto Hoopla's partner, that would be a great way to undermine him.<br><br>BBMolla/Egg is plausible. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8141342#p8141342\">Post 1021</a> looks like one of those forced \"disagreements\" that scum have with each other and Hoopla pointed it out in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8141659#p8141659\">Post 1022</a>.

In <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=51&amp;t=66444\" class=\"postlink\">Open 638</a>, her partner BTD6_maker was lynched D1. She spent the entirety of the day defending her partner and was quicklynched D2 when he flipped. Another scumgame (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=67083\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1806</a>) actually had a lot of similarities to this one. For those interested, Masquerade's partner Dunnstral was wagoned several times in the game from D2 onwards but Masquerade always found a reason to vote his counterwagon or push elsewhere, conspicuously avoiding her partner's wagon.<br><br>That strengthens my earlier point that Blankface/Mathblade isn't a Masquerade partner. It makes zero sense for someone like Masquerade to make <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8092659#p8092659\">Post 806</a> and just cavalierly plop down a vote on a partner's wagon when she could have stayed on Vedith and pushed that mislynch through. Scum also tend to hate it when they feel like there's a mislynch in the bag and suddenly, the votes move toward their partner. Unless they are very experienced, it's hard to resist the temptation to stay away from the deadline wagon hoping it won't go through. That still leaves me with <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Egg/BBMolla/Hoopla</span> that I need to look into in-depth tonight and make my decision.

I suppose it's partly because I was confident in a Hoopla townread for a while and don't want to wind up being wrong there, especially given she's one of the people who's seeing things in a similar way to me. I realize if she were scum, she's morphing her reads around to appease me but on the off-chance I'm wrong, I'd obviously feel less bad about lynching a town-BBMolla than a town-Hoopla given the latter did next to nothing the whole game. Egg, I want to lynch because I'm so confident in his scumflip. Re-reading the part where he agreed with House's reasoning that Wake/Hoopla were a team takes away the doubts I had earlier.<br><br>Mind explaining your BBMolla townread for me? I don't see it at all. He had a meltdown early game and coasted through three days. He's not even trying at this point.<br><br>Hoopla/Elyse is actually very unlikely. Elyse and Hoopla are both active, decent players and I don't see them cross-bussing for no reason. They're the types I'd expect to endgame as scum. Comparing them to how you/MoI cross-bussed in Mini 1800 doesn't work because a) you and MoI both have antagonistic playstyles, b) you and MoI had significant playstyle clashes even in the scum PT, and c) you and MoI are both huge bussers. Your notion of a good bus is one that's entirely unconvincing. I don't think Elyse's push fit into that category. She was a driving force behind why Hoopla is on the brink of a lynch today.<br><br>I don't think you should be so quick to discount Egg/Hoopla though. Egg tying Masq to Hoopla could be a scum-gambit to completely clear him when they both flip. This post is the one I'm very confident is coming from an informed perspective:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8117011#p8117011\" class=\"postlink\">post 866</a>, Egg wrote:</cite>House makes a good point about Hoopla and Wake being on the same page and avoiding interaction. Wake not being in Hoopla's so called town bloc is interesting with that in mind. Throw in the fact that Hoopla seemed to randomly exclude Masquarade from the Blank vs Vedith wagon thing earlier, then again on this Page (Post 729), and this very well could be the scum team (Hoopla/Wake/Masquarade). As much as I don't like Blankface's refusal to give any reads, that's probably my best guess at this point. Oh, I keep forgetting cmit too because he hasn't said much lately. Guess my \"too many town reads\" problem isn't such a big deal anymore. Strong town reads on Grendel, House, and Elyse is probably a good thing then.</div></blockquote><br>His reason for my slot (Wake)/Hoopla being partners essentially amounts to being on the same page and not interacting. This makes no sense given a) people who are on the same page have less reason to interact given they don't have disagreements to hash out, b) whether players collaborate is entirely dependent on playstyle. That this wasn't original reasoning but he ripped it off of House just shows he's going along with arguments that he knows will resonate with town."}

I simply do not have the time/energy to do so at the moment, so I have been tending to gravitate towards those rare glimpses behind the curtain amid the wash of noise and aimless bickering. I originally townread cmitc based on a similarly specific moment in the game.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8219814#p8219814\" class=\"postlink\">post 1345</a>, Wingback wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">@Hoopla;</span></span></span> re: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8215534#p8215534\">Post 1326</a><br>2) I have a hard time buying that your townread on BBMolla at the end of D3 in fifty page long game with over five weeks of playtime amounts to \"he had an emotional meltdown\" on page seven a couple of days after the game started. You have stated paranoia of him for just coasting on the townread you gave him but it's concerning that you never followed up on that line of thought. On your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8167320#p8167320\">Post 1188</a>, there isn't much thought required to claim that he was neighborized and to summarize cmitc's posts in the neighborhood PT. That's a pretty weak reason for it to have assuaged your concerns about BBMolla's lack of scumhunting. Mind going over it in more detail so I can see if there's more depth to it?<br><br>3) If you are town here, I'd like to avoid mislynching but as it turns out, you are the concensus scumread and you not nothing has made me second-guess my townread on you considerably. Especially given you seem happy to post in the Open Setup Review thread which shows you have enough time to spare for mafia-related activities. This is also at odds with typical town behavior where players about to be lynched want to get as much information and reads out there as possible. In fact, it fits with the scum motivation of trying to minimize interactive tells and going down quietly once they see the writing on the wall. Assuming you are town, I really need something from you, hopefully a massive wall of content with in-depth and updated reads.</div></blockquote><br><br>You're welcome to use the template of \"typical town behaviour\" to determine my play here, and for the most part I'm not proud of it, and genuinely don't know how to identify and overcome the source of my malaise. But it really only hits me town. I showed you different flavours of apathy/sheeping that has arisen in a couple of my town games, and could probably find more if I dug, but you won't find that from me as scum, and I typically do all good townie things that make you look townie like posting massive walls of content and being the most active player in the game.<br><br>Perhaps this is why I am sympathetic to molla's body of work in this game, because I don't find general activity and 'scumhunting' to be meaningful towntells -- it is with certain players, but I think a more accurate snapshot of his motivations came out early in the game when he was being wagoned, as opposed to 50 pages of nothing that he could do as either alignment. <br><br>I don't know. I feel like the type of content and effort required to escape the noose either today or tomorrow is too far beyond my scope, and that doing the little that I can afford to won't change anything. It's pretty obvious to me that the writing is on the wall for me with how locked in Grendel and Elyse are on me, as well as Mathblade now and whoever else is scum. I feel like the best defense I can possibly offer is just being honest and showing you my garbage apathy as town that you won't get from me as scum."}

But Mathblade, I suggest looking at Egg's play in this game as a whole. He's detail oriented and his play has depth but he's never really IN the game. I find it very hard to believe that someone in perpetual catchup mode with one foot out the door so accurately pegged Masquerade based on weaksauce reasoning and then so accurately pegged Hoopla as partners with Masquerade. The likelihood of that is so much lower than scum pulling off a bus on Masquerade and tying people to her pre-flip so he can set up where to push later on. Regardless of what Hoopla flips, I still think Egg is scum so I'd rather hang him first."}

Judging solely from her play this game I would say that Hoopla doesn't seem like the kind of scum player to be quick to bus her partners. So I could definitely see her hoping to salvage Mask at least one more day. I do think that that unvote was indicative of wanting to see if she could save Mask (Which makes more sense as scum since as you pointed out- Mask did not have two town posts to rub together), and she led the reasoning that Mask could use his shot to clear himself tomorrow. The thing about that is with Cmitc1 confirming there being a role blocker it seems like she would recant the plan to clear Mask via shooting right then and there since he would be blocked if he were a vigilante. Instead of moving back to interrogate Mask however, she jumped on me in post 1052. At that point Mask would no longer be confirmable, so why was she interested in trying to lynch a new target?

Like you said his Masq push was early, earlier than I expect bussing scum to push, and a lot of his posts just jive with what I'm thinking about the game. I don't see him being buddies with Hoopla either which isn't a strong point since she hasn't flipped yet. But you think he's scum with me, and I know that's not the case.

The first game I looked at re-affirmed my suspicions that he was bussing Masquerade. For instance, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7591411&amp;user_select%5B%5D=14922#p7591411\" class=\"postlink\">take a look at his ISO here</a> and Ctrl+F \"Newbie\" who is one of his partners. Egg replaces into the game and makes a giant catchup post most of which are points against his buddy capping it off with a vote at the end. Egg's partner wasn't under much pressure at all and the wagon was started by Egg. The stark similarity between that and his push on Masquerade here in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8063395#p8063395\">Post 208</a> should nullify the reasons anyone is townreading him. Granted, he's also townread his partners in other games (his partner Beck in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=59638&amp;f=53&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=14922&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">this game</a>) but my point is that his posts in this game are scummy and his interactions with Masquerade shouldn't be a reason for a townread him as they fit very, very well into the range of how Egg interacts with his buddies. In fact, his push on Masquerade was based on very nebulous reasoning and him winding up being right at the end fits much more with an informed perspective than town that genuinely found scum. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Solidly confident Egg is scum here and I'd like everyone to engage me on this read.</span> <br><br>Egg tying Hoopla to Masquerade pre-flip also makes more sense from scum tying his partner to the townie he wants to lynch next to set her up. Not at all sure who Egg's buddy is at this point. Just don't think it's Hoopla.</div></blockquote><br>I don't rely on meta much at all, but there are some situations that call for bussing more than others. I normally hate bussing but in some games I have to do it. I don't think looking at one game is a strong enough reason to completely abandon my reason for townreading Egg. Hoopla's \"let's let Masq shoot and prove himself\" reads much more as what scum would do to me than Egg's early vote on Masq.<br><br>Re your points in 1323:<br><br>1. I understand what you're saying here. Egg was trying to push Masq-scum to make himself look good and used weak reasoning to do so. But for me the timing is still off. It was so early in the game and didn't lead to anything. He didn't get any credit for doing it. I just think the risks outweigh the benefits so early on.<br><br>2. This is a decent point if Egg is scum with BlankFace. But one major reason I personally stayed on Vedith was because he already claimed at that point and I thought it was unnecessary to force a claim out of BlankFace if I was fine with either of the two wagons.<br><br>3. Egg wanted to let Masq confirm his shot before Grendel claimed, so I don't have much of an issue with that. I also found it very town of him to vote for Hoopla when Hoopla and kts voted for Grendel right before deadline. Egg could have so easily went with them and said \"deadline\" but didn't. <br><br>4. Yeah his play today hasn't been spectacular. I agree there. But besides yours, no one's has. The game kind of went stale and I could see frustration being a reason for his \"tempted to lynch BlankFace\" post because it took even more momentum out of the game.<br><br>Why do you think it could be BB as Egg's partner now?

That lessens my scumread on Egg given that this would be the first time Masquerade would have voted a buddy. She has four completed scumgames and she never votes a partner.<br><br>Something that bugged me about Blankface was that his readslist in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8093539#p8093539\">Post 809</a> contained only four players and he never follows up and completes it. It has been on the back of mind but I never really thought about it until I decided to look through his past games to see what I find. I found <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8037045#p8037045\" class=\"postlink\">this neat little tidbit of info</a> in a Mafia PT of his where he explicitly says that he ignores some people in his re-read in case anyone checks to see who he has ignored. In his scumgame, he's also fairly inactive although he does make detailed catchups and survives to endgame and win whereas when he's town, he's invariably among the top posters. That kills my townread on Blankface/Mathblade. It's possible I'm reading way too much into a stray vote.<br><br>Interaction between BBMolla/Mathblade strongly point to Math-scum, Molla-town as they reek of the same thing Math did in Mini 1800 townreading a lynchbait player (JohnnyFarrar) for weak reasons, just insisting that they are town because of \"meta\" that Mathblade can't explain with any depth of thought. I'm not entirely townreading Molla though given the total lack of effort into the game.<br><br>I don't know how I did it but I went through <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=59772&amp;f=54&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=14922&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">Egg's ISO in the game he listed</a> and read all of his over 200 posts. There a couple of points where he falls behind but I don't see anywhere in his catchups where he just parrots other people's reasoning for their scumreads which is my biggest hangup with him.<br><br>Given that at least four players are tunneled in on Hoopla and I can't get any of the rest to agree to a lynch elsewhere, might be best to just go along with lynching Hoopla. If she's scum, that's great and my initial townread was wrong. If not, at least everyone can re-evaluate. I think I'm over-analyzing the game so seeing a couple of flips would help. If I'm not alive tomorrow, my final reads are that Grendel and Elyse are town and that I have a slight leaning townread on KTS that I'm not confident in.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Intent to hammer Hoopla in a few hours.</span>"}

Also casting doubt on BB. (Post 1157)<br>-Hoopla handled to mask wagon in a very strange manner. It seemed to Elyse that Hoopla was trying to salvage Mask before realizing it wouldn\u2019t work, and bussed him. (1182)<br>-Not seeing through Mask\u2019s awkward claim. (post 1200)<br>- For voting me, and Egg. Elyse feels the cause behind double vigilante claim falls on Hoopla as well. (post 1198) (post 1200)<br>-Keeping one pocket town read is classic scum move. (1203)<br>-If Mask were planning to make this claim it only makes sense that at least one scum buddy would play along with it. Otherwise there would be not point to the fake claim, and Mask would be lynched. Seeing that Hoopla went with it then she must be scum.  (1292)<br>- Hoopla is keeping her options open to find a mislynch. (1316) <br><br><span style=\"color: #BF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Most Elyse's points are valid. I didn't think much of \"The PR slip\", thought that was a bit silly. Also think that her points that -Hoopla is casting doubt on BB/Hoopla is keeping mislynch options open-, and keeping BB as pocket town read are a contradiction to each other. Really like post 1292.</span></span><br><br>Grendel<br>-Hoopla let Mask\u2019s scum read of a universally town read player slip through the cracks. Being the instigator of the D1 wagons you\u2019d think she noticed that vote for one of her town reads made by Mask.(1159) (1185)<br>- lamp shading. Hoopla was very quick to back of Mask when Mask remained suspect even after his claim. Also very quick to assume that Mask\u2019s claim was provable.  Introduced that idea of a role stopper, and tried diminishing the threat of a role blocker. I think that scum would claim that Cmitc1 visited scum last night to remove the threat of another confirmed town player. (1209)<br>-Mask wasn\u2019t in danger to being lynched after Egg unvoted so Hoopla had no reason to unvote too. And while I voted my vote alone wouldn\u2019t hammer so the fear of Mask vig getting lynch was kind of silly. Further elaboration on how I predicted scum would play, and how Hoopla fitted that expectation. (1296)<br>- Why was Hoopla interested in finding a new lynch target when Mask\u2019s claim was no longer confirmable? She also led the reasoning that Mask\u2019s shot would clear him. (1304)<br><span style=\"color: #BF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">I think my points are all valid... well I guess that the lamp shading is a bit of a stretch.</span></span><br>Egg<br>-Voted Blank despite reasoning that he was probably town at the start of D2. Hoopla wanted to let Mask live before the Grendel claimed. (1204)<br>-Egg has been town reading me pretty hard, and his push on Hoopla could be partly due to her push on me yesterday. (Inferred) <br>(Looks like I\u2019l have to step back a day to find more reasons)<br>-Vote count analysis. Hoopla didn\u2019t put Mask on the chopping block even though Mask was in a similar postion as Vedith/Blank face. Also, switching the wagon to Mask in VC 1.08 makes more sense than switching it to Blankface given that Mask had more votes at the time. (901)  <br><span style=\"color: #BF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Kind of bare bones, but I'm pretty sure he is town with a busy irl situation. So no problem here.

Busses his scumbuddies, his push on Mask refelects an informed perspective, Egg ties scum buddy to town (Mask to Hoopla) (1318)<br>-Egg\u2019s suggesting to be lynched looked fake. (1323)<br>-Egg second guessing his scum read on Hoopla but isn\u2019t talking it out with Hoopla. (1329)<br>-If Egg thought Grendel was a cop why was he trying to get further information from Grendel? An experienced player wouln\u2019t suggests that get themselves lynched as it hurts town win-con. Mask push was bad because Egg used \u201cnull tells\u201d. (1343)<br>- Egg\u2019s push on Mask came too early. (1364)<br><span style=\"color: #BF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">I personally feel that his intial interaction with Egg (1238) lead to a biased reading of the game. I disagree with most these points. Maybe the second guessing thing, and the Egg suggesting himself to be lynched I can kind of see. But that's it.</span></span><br><br>Hoopla<br>-Wingback disproved the main reason that Hoopla was town reading Egg.

Now with that mind, I re-read the entire game. Egg showing up when Blankface was at L-2, voting VEDITH who had two votes and asking everyone what the case was on blankface makes zero sense as a partner. I've read enough of his games now to know that he wouldn't be so blatant or allow himself to be caught out so easily.<br><br>Elyse on the other hand makes perfect sense as a Mathblade partner. She had Blankface as a backpocket read but always preferred to push Hoopla. Hoopla and Elyse also had this odd interaction where they accuse each other of being partnered with Mathblade but Elyse's number one push has always been Hoopla. Elyse's argument that Hoopla voted Blankface D1 but didn't actually want him lynched and was distancing smacks of an informed perspective (knowing Blankface was scum) because why would Hoopla risk a wagon on her partner so late when a mislynch was assured?<br><br>This is confirmed when Mathblade replaces in and makes the most ABSURD argument that the scumteam is Elyse and Hoopla. So, she's playing the same game Elyse is tying her partner to a townie. Both have insisted that the other is scum with Hoopla while pushing Hoopla which is absolutely hilarious. Besides read through Mathblade's logic on why she voted Hoopla over Elyse and it makes no sense at all.<br><br>Then there's Elyse's post to me when I made the case on Egg in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8222450#p8222450\">Post 1364</a>. That was actually my first gut-ping with Elyse. She seemed a bit too pleasant and receptive to my Egg scumread where as the last game I played with her, her interactions with me amounted to \"I'm not reading your posts, die scum.\" Her characterization of my game being spectacular also reeked of trying to manipulate me into voting Hoopla. There is no way she should have been reading my play as \"spectacular\" given I was derailed the lynch on her biggest scumread. Her read on me also makes no sense since she was scumreading my slot earlier but then started talking about how my read on Hoopla was \"off.\"<br><br>After seeing Hoopla's flip and Math's reaction to it, it all falls into place really well.

For one, players who are natural bussers as scum find it a bit difficult to move into strongly townreading their partners the way Mathblade did. Secondly, the way she offered zero good reasons but had a high-confidence read based on nearly nothing fits very well into how Mathblade treats townies when they are town. See <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=66833&amp;f=2&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=22566&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">Mathblade's ISO in the game I'm talking about (Mini 1800)</a> and Ctrl+F \"johnny\" who was the day one lynch and see Mathblade's comments on him. They continually defend him with no reasoning, just insisting that he was town. At one point, I felt like Mathblade was scum who knew that Johnny was town. I got the exact same feeling when Mathblade was defending BBMolla. <br><br>Obviously, there's going to be the argument of Mathblade manipulating her meta to trick me. The response to that is a) What I said above about players who bus. They tend to have an innate phobia of strongly townreading their partners because of how bad it might make them look, and b) The things I noticed about Mathblade are not behaviors that you can change on a whim.<br><br>Math/Elyse not only makes sense with Math's general meta, it fits with the general scum tactic of tying buddies to a townie. Both Mathblade and Elyse said that the other was scum with Hoopla but only wanted to lynch Hoopla. See Math's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8222410#p8222410\">Post 1363</a> and all the quotes inside it. She says she doesn't see a world where Hoopla is scum and Elyse is town. Meaning if Hoopla is scum, Elyse HAS to be. By that logic, she should be voting Elyse. She doesn't. She's set on Hoopla.<br><br>On Elyse's side, I see <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8147420#p8147420\">Post 1122</a> as early distancing/tying Hoopla to Blankface. \"No actual intent on getting Blankface lynched\" is the type of subtle setting-up language I see as more likely to come from scum. Saying that the point I made about you (Egg) voting Vedith over Blankface was a decent point if Blankface is scum is another subtle slip-up where I could see her setting up to turn on you after Blankface's flip (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8222450#p8222450\">Post 1364</a>). The thing is, what I pointed out about you voting Vedith over Blankface is one of the reasons I think you are town now given how obvious it is that Math is scum. In fact, that entire post reads as \"you are making some decent points about Egg but I'm not completely sold, convince me.\"<br><br>When it dawned on me that Mathblade/Elyse was the most likely team, the way I saw the game playing out was scum kill Grendel (they did) -&gt; we lynch Mathblade -&gt; scum kill BBMolla -&gt; we no lynch since we're in 4P mylo -&gt; scum kill KTS. That sets up an Elyse/Wingback/Egg LYLO with me and you going after each other and Elyse being the \"undecided\" trying to see both sides of our argument. Once we give in and vote, she'd hammer. Anyways, that was my prediction and is a large reason I started fighting so hard against no lynching earlier today. It was that post by Elyse that gave me a good idea what to expect. You really should read that post and notice how she treats my scumread on you. I also played with Elyse before and can say with conviction that she's not this receptive to discussing my reads nor does she have the \"I-see-where-you-are-coming-from-but-not-totally-sold-give-me-more\" vibe. <br><br>BBMolla was actually dead-on when he said it was Elyse/Blankface. I didn't take him seriously at the time because there were so many other avenues I hadn't explored yet and wasn't close to having any answers. I also think Elyse's \"Hoopla is scum for casting doubt on Molla\" is a transparent attempt to get BBMolla on her side. I don't see her being bold enough to make that statement about a partner and it would serve no purpose. I don't think she's a bad town player who was unable to see that BBMolla wasn't confirmed and that Hoopla made the right call. <br><br>Elyse digging her heels in for a Hoopla lynch over Mathblade confirms what I thought. While it isn't individually scummy to want to lynch their top scumread as opposed to their second scumread when given the choice, it's more the fact that she <span style=\"font-style: italic\">had</span> Hoopla at the top and Blankface as a backup. She was scumreading Blankface all the way from D1 but always found a way to lynch others (Vedith and Hoopla) over his slot. When Hoopla claimed VT, her interaction with you was to shut down Hoopla's claim as not meaning anything (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8194552#p8194552\">Post 1268</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8194587#p8194587\">Post 1270</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8195862#p8195862\">Post 1272</a>). She gives herself an out \"confbiasing\" but it's notable how she resists going after the guy she's been pushing since D1.<br><br>Some of this is circumstantial but we're both agreed it's not KTS, and BBMolla doesn't make sense as scum with either Elyse or Mathblade. The two of them together make a ton of sense given their slot's play and positions in the game."}

You can't judge my alignment based on one game of experience with me. That's just fucking bullshit. I was scumreading your slot in that game and your posts were extremely scummy to me. I was saying \"shut up, die scum\" because I didn't want you to actually influence town and weasel your way out of a lynch. Here I think you're probably town (ngl this has tripped me up a bit seeing as your last ditch \"Elyse can we lynch MathBlade instead\" looks extremely manipulative and tries to paint me in a bad light because you know Hoopla was my main scumread forever and I wouldn't flip - if you're scum with Math that was an excellent move) so I'm gonna be more receptive about what you have to say.<br><br>2. The \"spectacular\" comment was literally because this game was deceased, dead, in the ground, and you came in and posted novels and brought it back. That's it. And if I was scum and you were town and you were getting it right, I would be pissed. I wouldn't compliment you.<br><br>3. You say I was too receptive to your Egg scumread. Ummmmm???? I refuse to vote for him. Like idk what this argument even is. I listened to you and debates with you on a bunch of points but I've never really faltered with that townread. It's not like I pulled a Hoopla and started casting doubt on Egg. Just because I didn't put my fingers in my ears and yell doesn't mean I was agreeing with you.<br><br>4. The thing is - I'm very confident Math is scum. Yesterday they mixed up their reads by saying \"hiplop\" (Hoopla) and I were scum together or something. I have to go back and check cause I don't remember exactly. It reeks as fake reads they couldn't keep track of. But do you think they'd fuck up how they were pretending to read their own scumbuddy? I don't. I think Math knows he fucked up and the only option left is to bus and have Math take someone down with him. (The fact that you are willing to lynch me today is ridiculous btw) I'm coming around to you as his scumbuddy because this all seems very pre planned. You asking me to switch to Math when it wouldn't happen, Math tying me to Hoopla, you doing a complete 180 and saying you're willing to lynch me today when Math basically scum slipped. It seems awfully suspicious.<br><br>5. You say I always left Blank as a secondary scumread to Hoopla. This is correct. Me, Egg, and Grendel who is dead town all had Hoopla as our top scumread. The thing is though that once she was lynched, what was I going to do? Suddenly start scumreading someone else? Math is coming next anyway. So you can't argue me as scum for having Math as a secondary scumread because it makes sense for me to do as either alignment.<br><br>I'd rather vote Math than no lynch at this point tbh"}

I never said Mini 1800 meta doesn't apply. I said it was unlikely you were bussing Hoopla. Your posts with regards to Elyse actually do fit in with what you would do as scum, being adamant about lynching Hoopla but claiming Elyse as a second scumread.

When did this change?<br><br>2) If you are scum with Mathblade, then I wasn't getting it right given I was pushing Egg mostly so I don't see why you would have been pissed as scum. Even if you were pissed at me defending Hoopla, you are acting like if you were scum, you would have shown that rather than try to buddy me and get me to vote Hoopla. If you were so confident in your Hoopla scumread, it makes more sense to have viewed my defense as an annoyance rather than bringing a dead game back to life. I certainly don't care for someone's activity level if their primary contribution is to derail what I'm doing.<br><br>3) Hoopla was town so \"not pulling a Hoopla\" isn't exactly a point in your favor. I have a lot of trouble seeing BBMolla as scum with Mathblade and KTS leans decently town as well. The fact that you refuse to vote Egg reads more like you are buddying him than town with an incorrect townread. Besides, comparitively, based on interactions with Mathblade, you come off worse than Egg.<br><br>4) This point is a stretch. If Math is scum making up reads with holes in them, then there are inconsistencies in those reads regardless of whether it's talking about a partner or a townie. Math tying you to Hoopla only makes sense from an Elyse-town POV if Math and Hoopla are both scum. Since Hoopla flipped town, I'm guessing their tying you to Hoopla was because you and Math are scum. Math explicitly said that you and Hoopla are the same alignment and today, Math has excluded you from the lynch list. That doesn't seem like they are tying you to Hoopla. It seems like they are tying Hoopla to you so in case you flip, they can lynch Hoopla, and in case Hoopla flips, they don't have to push you. I don't think Math \"scum-slipped\" in the manner you said although I'm perfectly willing to lynch either of you today.<br><br>5) When Hoopla flipped town, who was your pick for a scumteam and why? How did the townflip affect your reads on Egg, KTS, BBMolla, and me before you saw me push you today. In other words, what were your reads during the night and how were you re-assessing?"}

Bottomline, I think your sole reason for townreading Egg is because he for the most part was townreading you only bringing up the possibility that you are scum today, and even now, not very much. The only significant reason you gave me yesterday for townreading Egg was that he was pushing Hoopla and that if you are wrong there, you need to re-evaluate. I'm guessing that's setting up for Egg and I to go after each other. But now that I turned on you, you basically have no option but to push back on me and forget that Egg re-evaluation entirely. I also think you ignoring Hoopla's departing post where she tells you to get it together and that she supports me on Egg/Mathblade is a minor scumtell."}

Here's where I'm at:<br><br>Still think Elyse's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8222450#p8222450\">Post 1364</a> was manipulative and not the kind of post I'd expect from someone like her. Also, found her \"trying to deconfirm BBMolla\" push on Hoopla to be very weak, and for all the talk about how Hoopla was trying to keep BBMolla in her pocket, I find that it applied to Elyse more, given she was pushing BBMolla as confirmed town and blaming Hoopla for checking all her bases. The point about Hoopla pushing Blankface/Vedith at deadline while ignoring Masquerade is a major point Elyse brought up but that falls apart entirely when you see that Elyse was arguing Blankface is partnered WITH Hoopla. Then, her complete lack of re-evaluating Egg today after her top reason for townreading him was his push on Hoopla who flipped town doesn't look to have town motivation. She's only re-evaluating the \"easy-to-lynch\" players like KTS while sticking with her townread on the player she needs as an ally. Finally, and this one's not a very strong point but her completely ignoring Hoopla's last post is something I find more likely to come from scum because that type of appeal creates a lot of awkwardness and uncertainty on how to respond but this is probably not as strong as my other reasons.<br><br>Mathblade's posting hasn't shown me any reason to think she's town either. Tying Elyse to Hoopla but only voting Hoopla, the odd townread of BBMolla which is exactly the kind of bizarre townreads that Mathblade fakes as scum, the overblown reaction to my hammer vote on Hoopla, and the completely ridiculous logic where she clears Elyse if Hoopla flips town. <br><br>Both Elyse and Mathblade have been posting elsewhere on site (although this also applies to Egg and is one reason I have faint misgivings about him). But Egg's playstyle issues that I initially found scummy seem to be consistent across games in that he does play in catchup mode a lot. Grendel's point about Egg thinking that Grendel had a guilty on cmit was actually a decently strong point, not to mention the other two points about a) Egg not so blatantly tying his partner to a townie like he tied Masq to Hoopla, and b) showing up to vote Vedith when Blankface was at L-2 which is a very risky move as scum. I don't like that he hasn't given any reads whatsoever today and is avoiding the thread and my post specifically telling him to move his no lynch vote.<br><br>At this point, I just have to make a call on which of the three I find towniest, and Egg comes off significantly better than both Elyse and Mathblade. I'm likely going to go for Elyse over Mathblade since a) I think Egg's townread on Elyse from the past days is the weak point of the game that scum can use to win if I'm not here tomorrow. But Mathblade likely doesn't have the same skill as Elyse to make it through regardless of the composition of players the following day. b) We've already got KTS on Elyse so easier to get consensus here. Elyse/Mathblade interactions also look like they are setting up for Elyse to go the distance.<br><br>I'll be voting Elyse at 5PM today which is 2 hours 15 minutes from now. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Last call to respond</span> before I put the game on the line."}

Math saying that you and me are scum and voting no lynch, and then out of nowhere, showing up to vote Elyse. Most of her play this game has been of the minimal \"caught-scum-trying-to-plant-false-leads\" type.

I don't like one bit of your play today. You've been sitting on the fence pretty hard in those last few posts of yours. The only reason I'm more confident on Elyse is that for some reason, she's ignoring all of that and just appealing to you like she doesn't give a damn about your alignment and just wants to suck up to you. I'm trying to dissuade her from doing that if she's town and encourage her to assess your alignment so I can solidify reads on both of you and feel more confident.<br>4) Your wanting to lynch Math contradicts your previous post of not wanting Elyse/Egg/Wingback lylo because that's exactly what will happen if we lynch Mathblade and no offense but I don't really trust any one person to make the right decision here, and you haven't given me any reason yet to think you'd be accurate.<br>5) This is mylo so it's absolutely essential that you give your reads. That post reads more like you want an excuse for not posting your reads. I don't care what it might tell scum.

While I think you certainly can get a feel for the kind of player someone is in just one game, things change over time that can affect a person's play. Even variables such as game size, playerlist, and type of game will affect play just as much if not more than a player's alignment. Bringing this up countered a big chunk of what you said in just one line. Again, does this make Elyse town? No, but it is a good way to respond to what you said.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Elyse wrote:</cite>2. The \"spectacular\" comment was literally because this game was deceased, dead, in the ground, and you came in and posted novels and brought it back. That's it. And if I was scum and you were town and you were getting it right, I would be pissed. I wouldn't compliment you.</div></blockquote><br><br>This is a good point to an extent. I see where she's coming from and I absolutely see where this makes sense in context. If Elyse is scum though, maybe her team was in trouble and needed a shake up, so again, not necessarily town. Just a good arguement.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Elyse wrote:</cite>3. You say I was too receptive to your Egg scumread. Ummmmm???? I refuse to vote for him</div></blockquote><br><br>I think this one is obvious. She showed where you were wrong (which scum can do too of course)<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Elyse wrote:</cite>4. The thing is - I'm very confident Math is scum. Yesterday they mixed up their reads by saying \"hiplop\" (Hoopla) and I were scum together or something. I have to go back and check cause I don't remember exactly. It reeks as fake reads they couldn't keep track of. But do you think they'd fuck up how they were pretending to read their own scumbuddy? I don't. I think Math knows he fucked up and the only option left is to bus and have Math take someone down with him. (The fact that you are willing to lynch me today is ridiculous btw) I'm coming around to you as his scumbuddy because this all seems very pre planned. You asking me to switch to Math when it wouldn't happen, Math tying me to Hoopla, you doing a complete 180 and saying you're willing to lynch me today when Math basically scum slipped. It seems awfully suspicious.</div></blockquote><br><br>States her choice for a lynch with reasoning. Everything here seems to make sense. Determining how genuine it is is another story and that's what I'd rather spend my time doing if we do end up in 3p with you, Elyse and myself like you mentioned. Stuff like this is pointless and a waste of time.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Elyse wrote:</cite>5. You say I always left Blank as a secondary scumread to Hoopla. This is correct. Me, Egg, and Grendel who is dead town all had Hoopla as our top scumread. The thing is though that once she was lynched, what was I going to do? Suddenly start scumreading someone else? Math is coming next anyway. So you can't argue me as scum for having Math as a secondary scumread because it makes sense for me to do as either alignment.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Again, self explanatory. Having more than one scum read happens for town and scum. It was pointless for you to bring it up and she did a good job of showing why whether she is town or scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Wing wrote:</cite>I think you are missing something. If Math is my partner, I'd just vote no lynch and kill one BBMolla/KTS so red flags don't fly. Then when the other votes Elyse, Math and I would hammer. I don't need you in any spot to win as scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>Your point was that you could no lynch today. That implies that someone is NK'd before we lynch anyone in your master plan.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Wing wrote:</cite>It's the way you are being on the fence. I'm here in the game, consistently trying to garner information out of the town and making my motivations clear. The fact that you avoided the game thread for a day after you put your vote down on no lynch doesn't make your motives very clear to me. I'm also confused about your reads and your reasons for your reads. Have you re-read this game, thought about it, and re-assessed?</div></blockquote><br><br>I \"avoided\" your walls yesterday and the day before because I was busy going for morning walks with my wife and son both days, visiting my grandparents, playing kickball basketball and poker, and just doing things that are more important in general. I do those things regardless of my alignment in games and when a game is wall after wall after wall or just page explosions, yeah I don't get around to reading it in the 15 or 20 minute breaks throughout the day where I'm looking at my phone. And no, I haven't re-read 60 pages. It's hard enough to keep up with the first time. I sure as hell don't hate myself enough to do it again.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Wing wrote:</cite>Every read matters. I need to know more so I can figure out whether you are town or scum.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>I'll open up either when I'm close to a lynch or when scum don't get any more NKs, whichever happens first. You've pried enough out of me already.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Wing wrote:</cite>\u00a0There's no difference between losing the game today and losing it tomorrow. So, I have to figure out which of you or Egg are scum today.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Nah, we make the hard decisions when we have more info. if you are considering bbmolla or killthestory as scum or an egg/elyse team, fine. But if you think math is the second scum regardless, vote there."}

If you're trying to decide which way you are leaning between me and Elyse, look at the amount of sheer man-hours I put into reading you. Calling you scum, then second-guessing my read based on your responses, scumreading you again for that claim to vote yourself, finding a scumgame where you did just that, then reading over two hundred posts of an ISO you linked me, seeing that the catchup mode and calling scumteams is a feature of your townplay, then re-assessing that and deducing that you a) wouldn't so blatantly tie your buddy Masq to a townie, and b) you wouldn't show up with Blank at five votes and ask what's the case on him if you were scum with him, and then finally coming down to you as town and Mathblade/Elyse as a scumteam. I doubt any scum player on site would be able to fake that level of read development. Even now, I had misgiving about your posting until I saw Elyse's response to me and concluded that it was Elyse/Mathblade.</div></blockquote><br><br>This is a fair point. You've done a shit ton of research and why bother as scum? I mean for town cred obviously, but still. That's a ton of work just for \"lol towncred\".<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Wing wrote:</cite>Contrast that with Elyse's read on you. <span class=\"noboldsig\">She's just reading you as town because she needs you as an ally.</span> When I posted my case on you, she pretended that I had some good points but kept townreading you encouraging me to bring up more points so it's set as a you vs me without Elyse committing to the argument. It's the easiest read ever.</div></blockquote><br><br>You tell me to be unbiased and then say things like the bolded...<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Wing wrote:</cite>Now, she's pointing out nonsensical stuff like \"scumslips\" when it was extremely obvious from context that I was trying to figure out which of was Mathblade's partner and that your non-hammer showed me that it was Elyse.</div></blockquote><br><br>Scumslip is a ridiculous phrase to use there. I don't disagree with that. But the point she was making is that the only person who should see me as confirmed town is Elyse if she's even town. So saying you know I'm town is hyperbole and she matched it with hyperbole of her own. That's why I'm so frustrated. One of you (hell possibly both) is probably town and using manipulative persuasion techniques and can't own up to it. I mean it's too late now but if one of you had been like \"yeah that's what I was doing, sorry\", I'd probably town read that.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Elyse wrote:</cite>If you are so sure that MathBlade is scum and BB/kts are town that you're willing to consider Egg conftown by not hammering me, you should've been voting MathBlade this entire day.</div></blockquote><br><br>^this. 100% this. Like if you (Wing) were a cop and came in with a guilty and were like \"but let's lynch someone else\", everyone would tell you you're bat shit crazy. Well, that seems to be about the level of confidence you are claiming with your mathblade read and yet you want to lynch Elyse.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Elyse wrote:</cite>@EggI am willing to lynch MathBlade over Wingback today BUT Wingback scumslipped and there's a 1% chance it could be like BB or something.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>I don't know. I haven't ruled out you being scum yet and I think bbmolla has more than the 1% chance you mention. Is no lynching still worth it? I feel like there's still info to be gained as much as Wing is trying to make sure there isn't (whether intentional or not). At the very least, I feel like you and I are on the same page with how late game should be played and no lynch is very standard here. I'd rather have the extra info to work with than lose the game because whoever is town in this mess can't get organized and work together.<br><br>Wait. I just realized something skimming those meta links. Were none of those games where Elyse was town? Has she not been to LYLO as town or did Wing specifically pull scum games?<br><br>To Wing's 1531:<br>1) Nah, you're trying too hard to fit your narrative here. It's hard to say for sure because I wasn't there, but the \"one game\" arguement sounds better than your \"meta match\" arguement. Either way though, I didn't say Elyse was town for this. Simply that I felt she was winning the arguement. And the only reason we're discussing this is because you said you needed it to read me so it's even more pointless now than it was then.<br>2) All semantics and as pointless as point 1.<br>3) Oh, ok, yeah. I get you now. But you're assuming you know what killthestory would do which I still don't like. But you seem to believe it enough that maybe you're being honest here. Hmm... If our disagreement is strictly playstyle, which I'm not ruling out, you really need to convince me of that. Don't use hyperbole or talk to me like I'm dumb because I don't want to mislynch you for the loss just because we can't see eye to eye. It's not an easy decision. Don't pretend it is.<br><br>I don't like anything about Wing's interactions with killthestory on page 62 for what it's worth. Predicting where killthestory will vote sounds like scum mindset and the \"blacklist\" arguement is more semantics. Even when killthestory votes Wing, the reaction to the vote is very caught off guard and it feels like scum who thought they were in control until then.<br><br>Wing, I think everyone knows what you are saying as far as lynching Elyse before Math. What Elyse, myself, and now killthestory are trying to figure out is why the hell you think it's a good idea and can't comprehend that it's not.<br><br>Killthestory's 1562 is actually a very good point. Why would mathblade make that post as scum with Elyse? I also agree with 1564 that 1563 makes no sense. And the obvious answer to 1565 is that scum opportunism exists and momentum matters.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Wing wrote:</cite>I'm equally certain Elyse and Mathblade are scum.

Or was it just masq and cmit. If it was just the two, cmit being blocked does actually make some sense, especially if he said something that made it obvious he's a power role. It feels like this was all months ago for some reason and I'm very fuzzy on it.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Wing wrote:</cite>Talk to me about your read on Elyse.</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm not willing to lynch Elyse at this time.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Wing wrote:</cite>Hoopla'a premise of a rolestopper may not be completely wrong (in which case Math would have to be that rolestopper given it would have been used on Elyse N1).

It's hard to say for sure because I wasn't there, but the \"one game\" arguement sounds better than your \"meta match\" arguement.</div></blockquote><br>Meta is probably the most abused tool in mafia. If used correctly, it gets results, if used incorrectly, it gives bad results.<br><br>My read on you was probably a perfect example of poor and good usage of meta. At first, when I was reading your games, I drew the conclusion that your scumplay was similar to this. Your push on Newbie matching your push on Masq was an example of incorrect meta. But I got past that to see what you are like as a scum player. Your persona in general, etc. Reading your scumgames was what helped me understand how you think as scum. With that understanding, I predicted that you'd never so blatantly tie Hoopla to Masq and that you wouldn't show up and ask for a case on Blank when he was at L-2. You are not the type to take unnecessary risks or going for all-or-nothing plays. You're careful, and methodical which allowed me to deduce that your play here doesn't fit your scumplay because the moves you made are not ones you would make as scum.<br><br>I have a similar read on Elyse. I caught a glimpse of her personality and how she generally reacts to in-thread events by playing with and interacting with her briefly when we were both town. Elyse as town is a to-the-point, no-nonsense type player who has little patience for someone derailing a lynch on her biggest scumread. She's not going to go call their play spectacular.<br><br>That's how I use meta and that's when I've been most accurate with it. Meta is like scumhunting and I won't claim every read I make is right just like every scumread I have won't be right. But when I have an in-depth read and a full understanding of a player's range of behaviors, I can predict fairly accurately how they would behave as either alignment. The important part about your meta (being methodical and scum and covering your bases) overrides superficial aspects like similarity to Newbie push and Masq push. I sometimes look at meta superficially but if I'm playing well, I often manage to replace that with deep enough reads.<br><br>I'm pointing all this out because I want you to see what I see with Elyse as scum, and if I'm not clear enough, I can possibly rephrase what I'm saying. I no longer need to read you of course but that doesn't make this point meaningless because my objective now is to show you what I see with regards to Elyse.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8249880#p8249880\" class=\"postlink\">post 1596</a>, Egg wrote:</cite>3) Oh, ok, yeah.

Better to do this at this point when I'm not conf-biased. This is going to be in absurd mind-numbing detail so if you hate walls, feel free to read the tl;dr version. But I'm town and on the suspect list of at least two other townies so I'm hoping this will both a) show you why Elyse is scum, and b) help you get a read on me by seeing my internal thought processes.<br><br>The first ping I got from Elyse when I replaced in and started catching up was her reaction to Vedith when she backs off of her initial BBMolla push. The push itself was weak but I want to focus more on the back-off in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8061899#p8061899\">Post 181</a>. I thought it was odd but not necessarily scum-motivated. Vedith correctly questions it and there was nothing at all scummy about his post but Elyse has a ridiculously overblown reaction (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8063080#p8063080\">Post 197</a>) to a completely innocuous post and scumreads Vedith for it. It looked to me like her awkward back-off was bait to see if anyone pushed her on it. Oftentimes, scum players who can hold their own in an argument try to get scumread by weaker town players so that those town players get overconfident in their pushes and alienate the rest of the town in a way that they don't get followed on their read. In effect, she's making Vedith <span style=\"font-style: italic\">more</span> certain about his scumread on her to the point where he can't rationally explain it to the rest of the town. Once no one understands what you are ranting about, that makes you a much easier lynch which is exactly what happened with Vedith. It would be a fairly advanced scum strategy to pull off successfully but what makes great scumplay isn't posting convincing cases to mislynch players but baiting them into playing in a way that'll get them scumread by other townies.<br><br>Next look at the confidence in her Blankface read (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8073379#p8073379\">Post 385</a> + <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8074314#p8074314\">Post 392</a>). Given that, it stands out that most of her play around the Blankface/Vedith wagons was to shoot down the momentum on Blankface based on the reasoning that she doesn't want to out another role (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8097715#p8097715\">Post 824</a>). But more importantly, come D2, she completely forgets both the Blankface and BBMolla reads and goes for Hoopla instead. The \"Masq is a good vote\" statement looks like perfunctory distancing from a partner while laying down suspicion there so she can smoothly bus if the need arises. I initially townread her push on Hoopla because it seemed like she showed initiative in attacking one of the stronger players in this game and is a large part of why I reversed my scumread on her. But closer examination shows that Hoopla was the first to start getting suspicious of Elyse (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8089911#p8089911\">Post 767</a>) so I see this more as Elyse taking the pro-active stance to put Hoopla on the backfoot before the latter can start attacking. Regardless of your alignment, when you are the aggressor and your argument makes sense, you come off a lot more convincing than the person who's reacting to you.<br><br>Coming to Elyse's actual scumread on Hoopla (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8120507#p8120507\">Post 885</a>), it literally comes down to \"Hoopla didn't push Blankface hard enough.\" That's it and nothing else. The entire wall makes this single point. Elyse is careful to not tie them together but it comes off as a post that is setting up the stage to push Hoopla should Blankface ever flip. If Blankface were town, there's no reason a scum-Hoopla wouldn't push harder since she can out an additional role. In fact this was Elyse's biggest reason for wanting Vedith dead over Blankface. So, this case heavily implies scum-to-scum association between Hoopla/Blankface. But then she does a little 3-card monte trick and pushes Blankface out of her primary reads (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8138812#p8138812\">Post 985</a>) because of the double-stalled wagons on D1 which is the same reasoning Hoopla used to read Blankface as town earlier (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8113800#p8113800\">Post 857</a>). So, now she's arguing that Blankface is town which completely undermines her Hoopla scumread because it basically amounted to \"Hoopla didn't push Blankface hard enough.\" It's also odd that from here until Hoopla's lynch, Hoopla is always Elyse's top scumread when logic dictates that her Hoopla read was dependent on Blankface flipping scum. Besides Blankface quickly got voted up to L-2 so what was Hoopla supposed to do here exactly to push him harder?<br><br>When Masq starts getting wagoned, Elyse starts tying Hoopla to Masq instead re-inforcing Egg's thoughts about them being a potential team (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8122199#p8122199\">Post 899</a>). Switches to Masq when Masq's wagon picks up while making sure to tie Hoopla to Masq (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8124234#p8124234\">Post 913</a>).<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8147420#p8147420\">Post 1122</a> is the most interesting post where it's apparent that Elyse is making up reads. She explicitly implies that Hoopla/Blank are a scumteam by pairing them together and saying that Hoopla had no intention of getting Blank lynched. It doesn't make any sense from a town-Blank standpoint because to a scum-Hoopla, it's all the same whether Vedith or Blank get lynched but in Blank's case, she outs a PR. Following through with this logic, she offers two potential scumteams (Masq/Blank/Hoopla or Masq/Blank/BBMolla) at the end of day two. Two things to note here: 1) Blank is scum in both scenarios, Hoopla is only scum in one. 2) Her scumread on Hoopla is dependent on Blank flipping scum. Based on this, it's incredibly scummy that she only wants Hoopla-blood all of D3. Her play upon Hoopla's claim (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8194552#p8194552\">Post 1268</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8194587#p8194587\">Post 1270</a>) mirrors her play on Vedith's claim (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8091756#p8091756\">Post 788</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8092566#p8092566\">Post 800</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8097715#p8097715\">Post 824</a>). Both times Blankface was the opposing wagon, both times Elyse clearly supported the counterwagon to Blank. This despite Elyse's scumread on Blank.<br><br>Also, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8158675#p8158675\">Post 1157</a> contradicts <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8169326#p8169326\">Post 1203</a>. Is Hoopla-scum keeping BBMolla in her pocket or casting shade on him? Elyse just uses whichever argument fits her agenda. Then the solid Blank scumread fades away for no reason and it becomes Hoopla/Blank or Hoopla/Wingback. Then suddenly, that changes to saying that my read on Hoopla was \"off\" where she's treating me as town rather than say \"obvscum defending his partner.\" Then there's her big post where she calls my play spectacular and I've pointed out every scummy thing she's done since then."}

I think blaming everyone else for the Hoopla lynch might not be entirely accurate and is partly my frustration speaking. I think if I had the game figured out on D3, I could have gotten Grendel to sway his vote to Mathblade at the end and we'd have lynched Elyse today. So, this is on me for not solving the game soon enough. We can still win though because I solved it now but the gamestate changed to where I now have to convince everyone that I'm not scum.<br><br>I think I was outplayed by Elyse this day phase and it's not something I'd admit readily because I have a lot of confidence in my ability as a town player. Elyse not answering my questions seemed like baiting me to vote her so she could 1v1 analogous to her Vedith push. She saw that I was pretty set in scumreading her and decided that I'm the one she needs to push to win the game.<br><br>I keep hearing from Egg that Elyse is winning her argument with me and I literally don't know how to better explain it in a way that persuades you. You say that my meta read is trash and based on one game, that Elyse's dissonance in calling my play spectacular makes sense, that her ATE is town, and so on and so forth. I feel like whatever argument I bring up is shot down because apparently Elyse's arguments are all better, and every alignment-indicative thing I point out is deemed not null or worse, completely ignored.<br><br>I can accept losing to Elyse as she played so well but I'd hate it if we don't lynch Mathblade given she not only was obvious scum but cleared a townie I had doubts about (BBMolla) and made her partner really obvious, and I'm not losing to Math if I can help it.<br><br>I don't know what to do about Elyse. I got frustrated with you shooting down every post I made interpreting it in the worst possible manner, and not investigating how Elyse's fake-read on you contrasts with my genuine one. I'm putting all of my heart and soul out there hoping you guys see that I'm town here and if that's not enough, I got outplayed worse than I've ever been before and I'm hitting the limit of my ability. I could accept losing because I didn't figure out the scumteam out earlier on D3 and pushed Math over Hoopla and it's that little time lag that was the difference between winning and losing because if Math was gone and we still had Hoopla, I literally cannot see a scenario where we lose in that hypothetical.<br><br>I don't know how you are interpreting Elyse's arguments as better. Perhaps it's charisma, perhaps she's skilled at figuring out what people are thinking and playing to her audience. Perhaps she's good at tailoring her arguments to her audience (clearly I'm terrible at it given I wrote a massive wall to convince KTS, BBMolla, and Egg). Whatever she's doing she's doing it well and I'm completely lost here as to how I can make you see that I'm town but I really am town and as much as I hate to admit it, I feel like I've been thoroughly beaten."}

Mathblade's play all of yesterday reeks of trying to hide who their partner is. Town does not claim that you and me are partners and then suddenly out of nowhere vote Elyse in mylo.

I linked you to the post where mylo starts. Key points: 1. I've repeatedly pushed for a no lynch given I genuinely believe it helps scum. 2. I played well enough to survive and win the game but what's missing is the crazy amount of motivation I have to read players. I posted \"cases\" and pushed townies but never did I try as hard to read anyone as I tried here to read you. I don't even play like this in all my towngames but I think this one game is the one I gave it everything I got and I'm really hoping you don't let this blow up in my face. Not once in that game did I get as frustrated as I am here and that's something that's fundamentally absent from my scumgame. I'm calm and composed and always have a plan. I can be quite calm as town too but here, I've gone so far outside the range of what is possible for me as scum that even a cursory glance should tell you I'm town here. I'm frustrated because I'm pouring it all out there. You say it wasn't easy to tell whether it's me or Elyse. Well, it wasn't exactly easy to figure out that you were town and Elyse was scum either.

For one, players who are natural bussers as scum find it a bit difficult to move into strongly townreading their partners the way Mathblade did. Secondly, the way she offered zero good reasons but had a high-confidence read based on nearly nothing fits very well into how Mathblade treats townies when they are town. See <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=66833&amp;f=2&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=22566&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">Mathblade's ISO in the game I'm talking about (Mini 1800)</a> and Ctrl+F \"johnny\" who was the day one lynch and see Mathblade's comments on him. They continually defend him with no reasoning, just insisting that he was town. At one point, I felt like Mathblade was scum who knew that Johnny was town. I got the exact same feeling when Mathblade was defending BBMolla. <br><br>Obviously, there's going to be the argument of Mathblade manipulating her meta to trick me. The response to that is a) What I said above about players who bus. They tend to have an innate phobia of strongly townreading their partners because of how bad it might make them look, and b) The things I noticed about Mathblade are not behaviors that you can change on a whim.<br><br>Math/Elyse not only makes sense with Math's general meta, it fits with the general scum tactic of tying buddies to a townie. Both Mathblade and Elyse said that the other was scum with Hoopla but only wanted to lynch Hoopla. See Math's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8222410#p8222410\">Post 1363</a> and all the quotes inside it. She says she doesn't see a world where Hoopla is scum and Elyse is town. Meaning if Hoopla is scum, Elyse HAS to be. By that logic, she should be voting Elyse. She doesn't. She's set on Hoopla.</div></blockquote><br>Perhaps I'm being rather impatient here given the day has only opened a few hours earlier. But most of it is pent-up impatience from the past ten days of trying to get either one of the scum lynched and everyone sitting around on their hands and winding up no-lynching.

For one, players who are natural bussers as scum find it a bit difficult to move into strongly townreading their partners the way Mathblade did. Secondly, the way she offered zero good reasons but had a high-confidence read based on nearly nothing fits very well into how Mathblade treats townies when they are town. See <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=66833&amp;f=2&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=22566&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">Mathblade's ISO in the game I'm talking about (Mini 1800)</a> and Ctrl+F \"johnny\" who was the day one lynch and see Mathblade's comments on him. They continually defend him with no reasoning, just insisting that he was town. At one point, I felt like Mathblade was scum who knew that Johnny was town. I got the exact same feeling when Mathblade was defending BBMolla. <br><br>Obviously, there's going to be the argument of Mathblade manipulating her meta to trick me. The response to that is a) What I said above about players who bus. They tend to have an innate phobia of strongly townreading their partners because of how bad it might make them look, and b) The things I noticed about Mathblade are not behaviors that you can change on a whim.<br><br>Math/Elyse not only makes sense with Math's general meta, it fits with the general scum tactic of tying buddies to a townie. Both Mathblade and Elyse said that the other was scum with Hoopla but only wanted to lynch Hoopla. See Math's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8222410#p8222410\">Post 1363</a> and all the quotes inside it. She says she doesn't see a world where Hoopla is scum and Elyse is town. Meaning if Hoopla is scum, Elyse HAS to be. By that logic, she should be voting Elyse. She doesn't. She's set on Hoopla.</div></blockquote><br>Perhaps I'm being rather impatient here given the day has only opened a few hours earlier. But most of it is pent-up impatience from the past ten days of trying to get either one of the scum lynched and everyone sitting around on their hands and winding up no-lynching. If it's THAT important for you to hear Mathblade out, wait for them I guess. But to me, it seems very cut and dry. I can understand why it isn't so cut and dry to you if you haven't played with Mathblade before or have personal experience with them.

It's cool though because we reached the same conclusion. Elyse is the safest lynch to me but I'll go for either her or Mathblade."}

It's that for some goddamn reason, you are eating up everything Elyse is spewing when she's so obviously scum it's not funny. I explained this in depth.

I don't see how you think I've played badly. We've lynched one scum and I voted masq from the very beginning. I had to twist your arm to make a standard play and no lynch at 6p LYLO. Now we have a very good chance to hit scum today and my vote is there and yours isn't.

Then you suggest I'm cocky because I think I'm right in my reads. Well, if I didn't play the way I did forcing the interactions I did, we'd all probably be wondering if it was Egg/Expedience or Egg/Elyse or whatever the case until some derp votes town and scum quickhammer for the win as I've seen in countless lylos that have happened before.

This game went on a bit long, but I hope that it was worthwhile despite the difficulties.<br>Also, I'd like to apologize to all players for the D1 difficulties. The Mod PT contains a bit of information on what was going on behind the scenes, for those who are interested. For the record, since some players were asking me to justify my decisions in real time, I'll say that it's rare that a decision can be fully explained in real time (since that might require discussion of other players' alignments, ongoing games, and such). However, I'll always document my decisions in a Mod PT for public review later.<br>I did make a conscious decision to be judicious with replacing players for inactivity in this game. In hindsight, I think that I should have replaced players like BlankFace and BBmolla earlier, since they ended up needing replacements anyway. At the time, my logic was that, if a fourth or fifth prod would get them posting, then it was worth it to try a prod rather than immediately jumping to a replacement (even though it goes past the usual threshold of three prods). My goal was to keep the game running without interruptions, but perhaps the health of the game would have been better maintained by replacing inactive players.<br>As far as play goes, I was particularly impressed with Hoopla and Seraphim, who seemed to get the game back on track D2 and onward. The Mafia team also played a good game throughout, and until things coalesced at the end, it looked likely that at least one of them would sneak by to victory.<br>Overall I think that this game was not quite balanced, as the Mafia Ascetic Roleblocker was too powerful for the existing Town PR. The Weak Neighborizer role was the one that I was most excited to implement, but it didn't get much play here, which was unfortunate. It's perhaps worth noting that the 1-Shot Vigilante was originally a Jack Of All Trades (with Vigilante, Cop, and Doctor shots); I don't think that this would have been terribly unbalanced, but a better fix would probably be to adjust the Roleblocker (something like Ascetic Goon would perhaps have been fine).<br><br>PT links:<br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=90&amp;t=67180\" class=\"postlink\">Mod PT</a><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=90&amp;t=67407\" class=\"postlink\">Dead PT</a><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=90&amp;t=67182\" class=\"postlink\">Mafia PT</a><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=90&amp;t=67183\" class=\"postlink\">Neighborhood PT</a>"}
