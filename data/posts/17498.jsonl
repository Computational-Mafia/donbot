This game goes by Natural Action Resolution.<br><br>2.) This is a game, which is supposed to be fun and engaging.  So let\u2019s keep it as such eh? Keep it civil, no personal attacks please.  That doesn\u2019t make a game fun for anyone~<br><br>3.) Day phases will last 3 weeks, and Night phase no more than 3 days.  <br><br>4.) Expected posting is at least once every 72 hours.  If you don\u2019t post in that amount of time, you\u2019ll get prodded, and have no more than 48 hours to pick it up and post, before being replaced.  3 prods and you will get forcibly replaced.  <br><br>5-A.) Voting is done like this:  <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Midnight</span>.   Unvotes are nice, but certainly not required.  I do not count votes unless they are bolded, btw.  Sorry.<br><br>5-B)  Lynches take half the players living, plus one. Rounded down when needed.  If this does not occur by deadline, then a No-Lynch occurs.  Sorry.<br><br>6.) You quote the mod, you get pummeled to dust. Any questions?   <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br><br>7.) No outside discussion of this game with players or non-players, or get pummeled to dust as a result.<br><br>8.) Once dead, by whatever means, stop posting beyond the single bah post.  If you continue to post, you get turned to \u2018Neutral Survivor\u2019, therefore making it an automatic loss for you, regardless if your team goes on to win.<br><br>9.) <span style=\"color: #000040\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Bold Dark Blue</span></span></span> is my color.  Use it, and get pummeled to dust.   <br><br>10.) I will make vote counts as much as I can, probably at least once every two pages. <br><br>11.) If I make a mistake, like a wrong vote count or something, please tell me, and I will try to fix it as best I can.  If it\u2019s a more serious problem, please keep it to PM, and I will try to sort it to the best of my ability.  <br><br>12.)  Flavor- if there is any- has absolutely nothing to do with the game other than being there\u2026  but you knew that already, didn\u2019t you?<br><br>13.)  Any of the basic/general MafiaScum site rules I may have missed still apply.<br><br>14.)  I reserve the right to change/add a rule.  In the event that happens, I will inform you in-game.<br><br>===================================================================================================================<br><br>Sample role:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Welcome to Mini *insert number here*!  <br><br>You are a <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanilla Townie</span>.  <br><br>Your only power is your mind, voice, and vote.

The only reason a player who was wagoned in rvs will get lynched is if he responds badly under pressure.<br>2) Generalization. I can point to a game where the town wagoned me to l-1 in the confirmation stages and I was scum. Your chance of hitting on a truly random vote are 3/13 right now (again, assuming 3 man team, blah blah).<br>3) I don't know where you come from (no offence, you may have different mafia customs...) but people never really believe in early game reads.

The only reason a player who was wagoned in rvs will get lynched is if he responds badly under pressure.<br>2) Generalization. I can point to a game where the town wagoned me to l-1 in the confirmation stages and I was scum. Your chance of hitting on a truly random vote are 3/13 right now (again, assuming 3 man team, blah blah).<br>3) I don't know where you come from (no offence, you may have different mafia customs...) but people never really believe in early game reads. They will tell you otherwise to shake up the wagonee in order to get reaction.</div></blockquote><br>1) To be honest, I feel lost and confused on day one &gt;_&gt; I really don\u2019t know what goes on it it.

But have you ever thought about where that information comes from? How do we have more information on d-1 then d-2? Well because people talk and bandwagon people that's why.

Most likely you come from a place that has very short deadlines and where scum hunting isn't as encouraged.  The the advice of the guy with 3d glasses on darthvader, play a good portion of a \"noob\" (trust me they are just as competitive as normals) game and read the wiki and you should be fine.<br>2)generalizations hurt the town. This is because they discourage discussion, scum hunting, etc. But it is a minor point.<br>3)I'm having some difficulty with your point #3. But from my understand you are saying that we should build up wagons correct? Well that's the point of rvs. And actually someone going over the top to defend a really silly point is a \"Scum tell\" so yeah...<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>The point is I usually see no one as scum, but I most likely will since the day is longer.</div></blockquote><br>Again, you don't have to see anyone as scum to use your vote for town purposes. This may seem counter intuitive, but when you start to think about it it makes more sense. And naturally you will accumulate more reads later on.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>*sweat drops* &gt;_&gt; I know I know.. I really do need to change my ways.</div></blockquote><br>Its not a matter of changing your ways, its more about making the logical choice and thinking about the repercussions of your actions. This will improve over time. Look up any one of my games (this is CooLDoG) and you will see that I really suck (Go to mafia disscussion/forum 62 and ask anybody, except for a very select few).

Kalofer, I'd like you to explain your vote on The Kool. A real explanation, not just boredom.<br><br>Espeonage is also a liability to the town, saying that he's not even going to scum hunt today. He's going to town hunt. Great, it's not like the mafia are trying to look like town. If you look for town attributes, you're going to find them in everyone. If you look for the tiny slip-ups that make people scum, you're doing more good for the town. Also, it makes me uncomfortable that you claimed that The Kool was the next person that needed to justify themselves, without any real reason why. Explain why you think The Kool is scummy, please."}

Bandwagoning, if you use the world properly, is when someone just votes for someone based on other peoples' reasoning, or for no reason at all except to get a lynch.  Having people use their own reasoning is heavily encouraged, which makes bandwagoning inherently slightly scummy, expecially now that some people, at least, are completely and fully out of RVS.<br>2.

Otherwise Esp needs to be lynched right now as a liability to the town.  And you next, for thinking nothing wrong of it.<br>3. A good place to start with.

Mod killed for claiming something different? What the hell.<br><br>@espy/kool/espy town hunting thing. Okay where to start?<br>Town hunting is a perfectly valid strategy. Lets just say that right here and now. Vi wrote something about this that really hits the nail on the head (its on the wiki @ <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://mafiascum.net/wiki/index.php?title=A_Beginner%27s_Guide_to_Being_Awesome_At_Mafia#One_size_does_not_fit_all\">http://mafiascum.net/wiki/index.php?tit ... ot_fit_all</a><!-- m -->). By the process of elimination if you find all the townies then you automatically know the scum. I personally don't like doing that, but what ever works for you/him is best. So from Vi:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Vi wrote:</cite>scumhunting is hyped up pretty well, but being able to Townhunt is fairly close behind in terms of importance. For obvious reasons, you don't want to lynch someone you have identified as Town. In addition, as you accumulate Town reads you can begin to lynch and argue from process of elimination. As long as your Town reads are accurate, process of elimination is one of the scariest things you can do to scum - now they not only have to look Town (which is already difficult for them), but they have to look more Town than others in order to evade your suspicion.<br><br>Of course, this leaves the question of how to identify Townies. This comes with the same experience described earlier when scumhunting was discussed. </div></blockquote><br>I don't find town hunting in itself to be scummy.<br><br>I'm kinda getting why my other head likes kool as scum now, yet I'm still not convinced, I'm going to prod him to get in here and post his thoughts so far. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@mod, mind pming the people who have yet to confirm?</span>"}

I'm actually getting concerned about so many people throwing around 'X is confirmed [alignment]'.  Also, that's twice now you've voted for someone immediately after they voted you; it's not giving me any indication that my vote's in the wrong place.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Kalofer wrote:</cite>1) At the time everyone was either voting for elfen or trying to explain why elfen was scum, and a few weren't even in the game yet. Espeonage I saw as town, because he actually decided to go do something (townhunt with which I see nothing wrong) while everyone was too busy talking about elfen who I think is town. I didn't think it could lead to anything, it certainly couldn't have lead to a lynch that early and at best we would have gotten more info from reactions and taking our minds off of elfen.<br>2) Yes but he said it soon after and that only served to further illustrate my point. It may not be \"no mercy\" but it is intolerance and it got town bogged down in irrelevance, what was the point of having 5 votes on a person without it being decided whether he was going to be lynched or not? Waste of votes is what I'm trying to say I guess.<br>3) I don't think scum would give in to pressure after 2 votes during RVS and start telling us why they hate RVS.<br>4) There is no such thing as sure. I am null on chronos but he appears town.<br>5) This sentiment applies to everyone, who said it doesn't?</div></blockquote>What you keep doing is making statements about one player's alignment based on other player's alignments.  You don't have anything substantial.<br><br>1) So you thought Espeonage was town ... since he wasn't attacking Elfen, who you thought was town.  Apart from wondering how you came so quickly to the conclusion that Elfen was town, why does <span style=\"font-style: italic\">not</span> focussing on him make a player town?<br>2) Pressure, often given by multiple votes, leads to (generally) more talking and better reads.  We are not limited in how we can use our votes, so it's silly to talk of 'wasting' a vote.<br>3) Why not? Hating RVS would be non-indicative of alignment, so why would <span style=\"font-style: italic\">saying</span> that you hate RVS be a town-motivated action?<br>4) So you immediately changed your vote solely on his suggestion ... why?<br>5) You implied it doesn't when you implied {Espeonage, Elfen} are town yet Elfen 'could be scum for all I know' and are happy to lynch him, wheras Espeonage seemingly could not be scum and you were happy to follow him.<br><br><br>I am mostly in agreement  with charter's post 297 and CooLskins' #299.  The main exception is that I think Kalofer is scummier than both The Kool and SleepyKrew.  I tend to think it would be beneficial to allow Elfen and The Kool to 'find their feet'; so we can separate early-game 'newb-null' play from later-game 'regular-alignment-indicative' play.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Panzerjager wrote:</cite>I think they two scummiest people here are Kal and Sleepy to be honest with you.

Someone <span class=\"noboldsig\">on the wagon</span> and <span class=\"noboldsig\">willing to hammer</span> can ask for a claim, then we go from there.

Have your previous three votes been solely for pressure/reactions? On a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being 'I knew that would happen' and 10 being 'gives up playing Mafia for being so wrong', how suprised would you be for each of your town reads to flip scum?"}

His following of Espy, who is, as far as I have seen, the only person he is following.  His \"He looks town to me\" read on Espy with no explanation.  His insistence that Elf is town, and while maintaining this stance, still willing to turn and vote for him (#215-#220).  His apparent belief that we have to lynch people to confirm that they are town, which is kinda pointless to me, not even trying to confirm them other ways.<br><br>I would vote Kal, but I am already doing so.<br><br>I also used to be pretty sure of Sleepy's reasoning, but now I'm not so sure, and he's feeling scummy.  But as I can now hear the birds outside my window, read will be tomorrow.</div></blockquote><br><br>You could have just said: \"I think he's scum based on everything everyone else said\" but even if you had I wouldn't have accepted it this time.  I'm not even going to bother to explain how many of the things I've said you've misunderstood completely in an effort to make me look scummier."}

I'm really interested in this elfen/sleepykrew argument, especially with Necessary Evil's quick interjections. I understand trying to stir the pot, but he could be more specific.</div></blockquote><br>In the second post, he was doing the EXACT SAME THING he was getting on my case about with the first.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Quinnster wrote:</cite>However, where I differ is that I believe Elfen to be unreadable at this point. If he had more experience and was playing this way, I'd call him scum right off, but right now he seems desperate. It's really hard to get a read on a desperate person, as they're grasping for straws in the same way scum without valid reasoning do. We've backed him into a corner and seen that he caves a bit under pressure. Good, now we know, let's move on.</div></blockquote><br>It seems he was one of the ones to really advocate the backing off of Elfen, though oddly enough this was AFTER people had already backed off, and he didn't even say he was town.  All he said was \"He's desperate, okay, move on,\" as if mafia aren't far more likely to get desperate than townies.  And then people moved on, and have forever since called Elfen town, mostly based on variations of that reasoning right there.  Of course, this could mean he's right, but I get a bad vibe from it, so I'm including it.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Quinnster wrote:</cite>Oh I have my own town reads right now. I think Sleepykrew is town, based on the fact that he's been on the same train of thought I have. What I don't agree with is townhunting as an alternative to scumhunting. We need to be doing both, all the time.</div></blockquote><br>That's a BS reason to think someone is town.  Anybody can come up with the same reasons that people have already said, especially mafia.  Thinking he is town because you agree with his reasoning is total BS, and makes you look scummy alongside him.<br><br>He has also gotten REALLY snarky at times, especially #247.  This doesn't in itself mean he's mafia, but it's not helpful to the town.  While getting rid of him because he isn't going to be helpful isn't valid anymore, because he was rep[laced, it still indicates that he didn't have a very pro-town mindset, which indicates that he didn't have a pro-town role.<br><br>#284, he instantly comes out trying to ingratiate himself with me with assurances that he's on my side, FAR more than he had ever done with anyone previously, or in fact than anyone else had done.  He then tried to use this... lemme quote again.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Quinnster wrote:</cite>Okay, The Kool. Here's what it comes down to. I was asked why I find you so pro-town, so I went back and read your ISO. You're playing really scummy, and I honestly can't blame people for finding you suspicious. However, I don't want to waste today's lynch on someone I believe so strongly to be pro-town. I want you to claim. I suspect that you've been breadcrumbing, and that's the only reason I have for finding you pro-town. If you're a PR, claim now so we don't lose a townie today and another tonight.</div></blockquote><br>Everything about this post is all wrong.  He says he find me town, but that he can't find any reason for it, and I look totally scummy, but he still believes beyond a doubt that I am town.  He then tries to get my role, especially if I have a PR, for BOGUS reasoning!  According to his earlier statements about bandwagons, he has no need to be concerned that I'm going to get lynched, and having me claim a power role, if I am one, only assures that the mafia will be able to kill a power role tonight, instead of having to guess.<br><br>He then comes back, when called on this post, to say he can't defend himself, and he isn't even going to try, and plays the stupid card.  He says his actions were inexcusable.  He then says that he is willing to die for this mistake.  That is something townies sometimes are, but in my experience, only the stupid or the mafia ever say, as a last resort to make people think they really are town.  Either case, if they really are willing to die, we might as well oblige them.<br><br>When asked for a read, he comes back with less than half a dozen posts of reference (#335).<br><br>We then get no further read on him, because he seeks a replacement, and Ear refuses to vouch for him.  Ear plays better town, but he's asking us to ignore Quinn and all his mistakes and slip-ups, in the hope that he can do things better.<br><br>Honestly, this is a far stronger read than I ever had on Kalofer, but that doesn't mean I suspect Kal any less.  If we start voting for Ear, I'll vote for him too at first opportunity, but right now my vote is on Kal with the rest of the majority.  Better him then me, right?  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">"}

Apparently I do... So you voted him because he was <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>After you for a while</div></blockquote> and because he didn't answer questions. <br><br>The second reason is legitimate, not answering questions isn't pro-town and stops the town from gaining information. <br><br>The first reason is out right [insert your favorite slightly offensive derogatory term]. So you wanted to lynch charter (who flipped town I might add) simply because he was suspicious of you? I have suspicions of you, why don't you want to lynch me? I have been after you for a while now, why don't you want to lynch me? I have a feeling that the second reason is just to cover up your real motive for wanting charter (and using the same logic, <strike>me</strike> us [damn hydra] lynched). Your real motive for wanting charter lynched is to get rid of people who suspect you. <br><br>And you should never vote for someone just because your wagon failed, you should always be voting for your number 1 read, unless deadline/special mechanics would make it unwise for you to do so. And farther more, no one was going to lynch charter. There is/was even less support for a charter lynch then for a kal lynch. So even your point about kal's wagon fizzling out makes no logical sense. <br><br>Ohh, and we must add this in as well while we are at this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>SleepyKrew wrote:</cite>If I don't die, that is.

He was real strong in going after Quinn/Ear, and tried to get him to hammer himself.  This alone isn't enough for a scum read, so I'm thinking Null read, but lynching him is either a good idea or a bad idea, no middle ground in his case.  However, lately he has been jumping around quite a bit, and can't stick to a single vote...  Null read, leaning scum pretty heavily.<br><br>LordChronos: Also lurking, but with sensible reasons that were not excuses after the fact.  He also actually puts forth an opinion and there is substance in what posts he has made, unlike our other lurker.  However(and this is a bit of meta), his record shows that he is pretty good as scum, so I'm inclined to keep a closer eye on him.  Null read, leaning town."}

But some reason they think the person is scum :/ That is why, on most of the games, I don't vote on the first day, it is way easer to find scum on the second day, looking back on what people have said and all. That is my style, waiting for information to pass by then go at it, not try to strive for it when I know I won't able to get it. I dont give a flying shit if other people vote for other people, that is fine by me, it gives me a chance to see why and what was the consequences in the action they had.

It doesnt clear him, but it lowers the chances</div></blockquote><br>Did I say I wanted to lynch a townie? No I said that defending other people isn't pro town. This is especially true in the early game when you have no real reads. From what I read so far today (pages 5-13) people were defending each other right and left when they really had no basis for their town reads. It is one thing to say \"I don't like that particular lynch because of x\" and another to say, \"X can't possibly be scum because he is so obv town for these reasons.\" One is arguing that their are better lynches out their (my scum reads) the other is arguing that a player is town...<br><br>Now that was probably poorly worded so let me explain farther.<br><br>Pressure is always good. Putting somebody under pressure is always a good thing. The town always gets information out of it (the game is in fact the uninformed minority verses the informed minority). Somebody else defending another player lessens that pressure and hurts the town. It also allows for the person being questioned to say \"ohh yeah, exactly what he said\". That doesn't give the town any information does it? It doesn't even give the town a hint of a motive. It is also a way for scum buddies to help each other from getting lynched. <br><br>Lets take this example.<br><br>A noob scum player comes into a game and makes a bad post. Somebody questions him about it and he answer poorly. The same person attacks him on his answers. The noob's scum bud comes in and answer for him and defends his actions. Noob says, \"he hit the nail on the head lets go home\". <br><br>Put simply you should never need to defend another player. You should be persuade the town to your specific scum suspect and have them lynch him. You should use all of your energy to get the people you think are scum lynched under all circumstances PERIOD. Defending people simply distract you and the town from that goal. <br><br>from the wiki:<br><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://mafiascum.net/wiki/index.php?title=Albert_B._Rampage%27s_Guide_to_Focusing_on_Scum_and_Getting_them_Lynched\">http://mafiascum.net/wiki/index.php?tit ... em_Lynched</a><!-- m --><br><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://mafiascum.net/wiki/index.php?title=Basic_Attack_Maneuvers\">http://mafiascum.net/wiki/index.php?tit ... _Maneuvers</a><!-- m --><br>and if it can be considered valid:<br><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://mafiascum.net/wiki/index.php?title=ReaperCharlie%27s_SCUM_Manifesto\">http://mafiascum.net/wiki/index.php?tit ... _Manifesto</a><!-- m --><br><br>All of these suggest that attacking your target is the best approach for town.

Also his read on Elfen as newbtown, with no evidence to differentiate between that and clever mafia.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Also because I desire for there to be a lynch soon.</span>  This is and isn't a bandwagon.  I have indeed presented reasoning above, which makes it, at least, less scummy than Kal's bandwagoning.  He has presented some redeeming logic, but anyone can be logical, even mafia.  I may go read through a few more people, but for now, I'll vote for him.</div></blockquote><br>We have sooo much time to make up our minds. Why should we lynch soon when we can wait a bit to make a better read? You aren't suggesting that we quick lynch day 1 are you? And why is lynching now better for the town then lynching later?<br><br>Right now I'm fully convinced that kool should be today's lynch. He also never seemed to defend (at least to my satisfaction) his sheeping and going with the flow. <br><br>In other news, I need to really arse my hydra partner to post more.</div></blockquote><br>not to quote myself but I still have the exact same reactions to that kool post...<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>The Kool 286 wrote:</cite>Yay, thank you, my head hurts less now.<br><br>As for the 'posting just to post', that is precisely what it is.

Seems like you're asking me questions to try and understand my logic but I'm starting to think you're purposely misunderstanding it.

If, however, you claimed at l-1 you wouldn't have given the scum the information as early as you would have when you claimed at l-3.

But we can't really find that out unless we lynch one. But if we lynch somebody and they flip town then we lose the game. Basically we can lynch today and win or lose the game, or we can no lynch and hope that hip's/panzer's jk blocks the scum kill and then we lynch them the next day. However, the later is flawed because both hip and confirmed town espy have said that they have been role-blocked. This means that the scum will role block the person that they know is the real jk (ether panzer or hip). <br><br>So in essence right now we have a 50/50 on our hands. Both hip and panzer can't be town. One of them is scum. Now is the time that we go back and dig up voting records and the claims that both have made in order to make an informed decision and tip the odds on that 50/50. <br><br><br>Bub has a draft saved here that has some reads that aren't finished yet, so expect those from him later.

If a skilled cop gets a guilty on someone, he makes a case on them, he doesn't say \"hey guys, I'm the cop and here's the guilty\" Gives scum too much info. And yes, I would have lynched scum but giving the scum infor in return. They would know both info role(Espeon and Charter), known what is most likely the only protective role(me), and known that in order to protect Espeon I'd have to block him.

CO had virtually no connects to anybody, and while he was the SK, his lynch didn't get as any closer to finding scum at all.<br><br>At any rate, the issue we have right now is either Panzer or hip. We have confirmed scum in one of them. While we could go anywhere else, I don't think we'd have as good a shot as 50%+. For that reason, I've re-read Panzer response to hip's claim, to see if it is consistent with him being a jailer. After Hip posted his claim that SK didn't have a killing role, Panzer was on him, and then off him.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Panzer wrote:</cite>Sudden epiphany:I'd be willing to bet Hipplop is lying, Seems weird that he would vote Sleepy after getting a result on him with gunsmith. Also SK's are generally considered not to have guns so He wouldn't sense the SK(they carry knives in most games here)</div></blockquote><br><br>He seems to weakly think that Hiplop is lying (if he strongly felt that way, he would have voted for him). This is interesting, because at this point it is assumed that Hip is a gunsmith. This could be town-panzer saying \"Hmmm, could there really be a watcher, tracker, gunsmith, Jailer, and three scum in a 13 player game?\" while also make a point about hiplop's voting, which brings further questions to his claim. He's on his case for a few more posts and then he drops him when the hoopla dies down a little. <br><br>However he gets back onto hip later for getting onto the Kool wagon too fast. After that, Hiplop claimes jailkeeper, and Panzer responds with this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Panzer wrote:</cite>Bullshit<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote:Hiplop</span></div></blockquote><br><br>And then later:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Panzer wrote:</cite>No, You can't mistake what he is claiming to have mistook. Every vote on someone that is voting on you isn't OMGUS<br><br>Unless the Mod took some serious liberties with the way the role PM was written(or the English language), there is no way you could have missed the fact that Jailkeeping someone roleblocks them. Also, that's essentially the main way to play jailkeeper, is use it as an RB role.<br><br>The actions and the claim do not add up. Either this is a lying scum or a lying SK. But one way or another, Hiplop is not a jailkeeper.</div></blockquote><br><br>I view both of these as strong evidence that Panzer is telling the truth. You would expect him to instantly get onto Hip, like a switch had been flipped, once Hip claimed jailkeeper. The assertation that he wasn't the jailkeeper was strong, and IMO, not supported by the evidence he presented. This leads me to belive that he was the jailer himself.<br><br>He keeps on pushing hard on hip, insisting that he's scum. However, he relents a little when he sees the hiplop wagon going nowhere and gets onto the CO wagon. Overall, I see a generally consistent view from Panzer, and exactly what I would expect from the real town jailkeeper in that circumstance. When hiplop claims jailer, Panzer flips and starts attacking him all out like never before. While he does relent in the end, I feel like this was after he realized that the wagon wasn't going anywhere and he consents to a CO lynch. After that, he knows he's got to get hiplop lynched because he knows that hip is scum (and it's MYLO) so he comes out and counter-claims.<br><br>This is much better than Hiplop's kind of wishy-washy claim. Looking back, it looks more like a botched attempt to either protect a possible scumbud (SK) or gain some town cred. Either way, Hip is scum. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: Hiplop</span><br><br>Panzer claim is much more consistent and believable than hip's, thus making hip the liar (and the scum).<br><br>I also really don't like this most recent post by Hip.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Hiplop wrote:</cite>nice find chronos. Explain why keeping the SK alive is a good thing Coolskins. now</div></blockquote><br><br>This doesn't add anything the discussion. All it serves to do is to try and deflect attention away from himself. This is trademark caught scum."}

In adition to having more information we would also have a confirmed townie going into lylo. <br>This may take some time, but I'm going to show you guys the different situations we can come into depending on a sleepy lynch, or a CO lynch.<br>This might also be a little bit confusing, but it is essential.

(6/3)<br>Flip: Town<br>SK kill: town<br>Mafia kill: town<br>Day 3,<br>5/3 with 1 confirmed town so essentially that's a 4/3, with connections, and with a JK result.<br>Now with this info we have to play a little bit farther to see what the sk will do (vote with town or with scum)<br>Lynch: town (who that would be I do not know)<br>Scum kill: town<br>SK kill: town<br>day 4,<br>2/3, resulting in an sk loss.<br><br>(go back to day 3)<br><br>Day3, 5/3<br>Lynch: town<br>SK kill: has to be scum or a loss will insue<br>scum kill: town<br>day 4<br>3/2<br>At this point we should have a buddy connect, like the panzer/kool one that we have now. So we should have a logical next lynch set-up. But lets go hypothetical<br>lynch: town<br>Sk kill: (again has to be scum or loss)<br>scum kill town (yes, I will go back and see what cross kills will look like)<br>day 5: 1/1/1 SK/scum win.<br><br>(go back to day 3)<br><br>Day 3 5/3 (sleepy has still flipped town, so in essence we lost the coin flip that we are going through right now)<br>lynch: scum (This should happen. A kool/panzer lynch would have had the most motivation back there and we know for sure that panzer would have flipped scum, and kool is heavily connected to him.)<br>Sk kill: town<br>Scum kill: town<br>day 4 3/2<br>lynch: will be connected scum<br>SK kill: (3 on 1. SK actually might no kill here. He has to hit scum in order to have a chance. [end up 1/1 draw, is that what he wants? Would the sk win in that circumstance? If yes, he would just kill away]) town <br>scum kill town, game over draw/sk win<br><br>(go back to day 3)<br><br>day3 5/3 (okay, this is getting a bit old, I will now cover the most probable outcome)<br>lynch: Scum (kool. He had the most support for a lynch and would have gotten my vote. He would flip scum because of the panzer connection)<br>1/3 chance of killing scum rb and getting a jk result.<br>sk kill: town (why not? He doesn't want a 3/1/1 does he?)<br>scum kill: town<br>day4 we are at a 3/2/1 <br>lynch Scum (panzer, need I say more?)<br>50/50 on rb.<br>so now its a 3/1/1 <br>SK: kill town<br>Scum kill town<br>1/1/1 - draw sk win<br><br>The only modification here would be if the sk killed scum.

Actually its a bit closer to 100% but that another story.<br>SK kill: town<br>scum kill town <br>2/1/1 <br>This would have been a very interesting situation. Scum actually have motivation to work with the town to avoid  sk draw-win (2x cross kill would be very funny wouldn't it?). But the town have to lynch scum to avoid a loss (scum kill town, 1/1 draw, possible loss depending on mod). SO we would have a potential hold out from the two townies if they realized the situation. Get a no lynch and then scum have to kill the sk (at this point you are just throwing up your hands and hoping that scum hit sk and sk hits scum. Because otherwise you are going to run into a draw/loss)<br>correct lynch here is no lynch. Then you put your faith in the remaining scum to kill the sk. Then you have a 2/1 lylo. <br><br>My conclusion is as follows. IF we lynched sk instead of CO we would have had a hell of a lot more time to make reads and prepare for lylo. Its still essentially a coin flip (as we know it is right now. Hindsight works here because that is what my comment was made in), and it would have been a hell of a lot better going into lylo with only 1 scum instead of 3 (this is a pretty big assumption). But natuarlly killing the sk early will allow us a road to victory if we can lynch 3 scum in a row. All in all It would all still rest on a 50/50 coin flip (ether on sk/panzr/hip yeas due to the connections...). And arguably the town have a chance at winning here, and in most other cases (where no cross kills happen) the town draw-loses. But the fact remains we have to lynch 3 scum in a row on a basic 50/50. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">mod, prod the shit out of kal</span>"}

I'm not going to give up/vote myself as i find that pretty lame but since none of you seem to realize the obvious trickery, Panzer, this was some good play, good perfect-scum victory on your part. Your play today was ingenious, and using coolskins to put it over was a smart move. Sorry town, i just couldnt convince you well enough, i suppose this was a great scum team, so if we were to lose to anybody, im glad it was those three. Looking forward to future games with all of you, though i hope id be on the same side next time (to panzer, and coolskins).  I hope you all learn from this for future play and stuff."}
