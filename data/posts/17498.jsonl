Mafia wins!</div></div><br>\n<br>\n===================================================================================================================<br>\n<br>\nRules:<br>\n<br>\n1.) This game goes by Natural Action Resolution.<br>\n<br>\n2.) This is a game, which is supposed to be fun and engaging.  So let&#8217;s keep it as such eh? Keep it civil, no personal attacks please.  That doesn&#8217;t make a game fun for anyone~<br>\n<br>\n3.) Day phases will last 3 weeks, and Night phase no more than 3 days.  <br>\n<br>\n4.) Expected posting is at least once every 72 hours.  If you don&#8217;t post in that amount of time, you&#8217;ll get prodded, and have no more than 48 hours to pick it up and post, before being replaced.  3 prods and you will get forcibly replaced.  <br>\n<br>\n5-A.) Voting is done like this:  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Midnight</div>.   Unvotes are nice, but certainly not required.  I do not count votes unless they are bolded, btw.  Sorry.<br>\n<br>\n5-B)  Lynches take half the players living, plus one. Rounded down when needed.  If this does not occur by deadline, then a No-Lynch occurs.  Sorry.<br>\n<br>\n6.) You quote the mod, you get pummeled to dust. Any questions?   <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br>\n<br>\n7.) No outside discussion of this game with players or non-players, or get pummeled to dust as a result.<br>\n<br>\n8.) Once dead, by whatever means, stop posting beyond the single bah post.  If you continue to post, you get turned to &#8216;Neutral Survivor&#8217;, therefore making it an automatic loss for you, regardless if your team goes on to win.<br>\n<br>\n9.) <div style=\"display:inline;color:#000040\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Bold Dark Blue</div></div> is my color.  Use it, and get pummeled to dust.   <br>\n<br>\n10.) I will make vote counts as much as I can, probably at least once every two pages. <br>\n<br>\n11.) If I make a mistake, like a wrong vote count or something, please tell me, and I will try to fix it as best I can.  If it&#8217;s a more serious problem, please keep it to PM, and I will try to sort it to the best of my ability.  <br>\n<br>\n12.)  Flavor- if there is any- has absolutely nothing to do with the game other than being there&#8230;  but you knew that already, didn&#8217;t you?<br>\n<br>\n13.)  Any of the basic/general MafiaScum site rules I may have missed still apply.<br>\n<br>\n14.)  I reserve the right to change/add a rule.  In the event that happens, I will inform you in-game.<br>\n<br>\n===================================================================================================================<br>\n<br>\nSample role:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Welcome to Mini *insert number here*!  <br>\n<br>\nYou are a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vanilla Townie</div>.  <br>\n<br>\nYour only power is your mind, voice, and vote.

But, you also have to get a bandwagon on guy to l-1 without people noticing, which is a very very difficult. I just don't see (and have never seen) how an rvs wagon could go to a lynch or get out of control.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Elfen wrote:</cite>Well one, I did use Random.org ._.</div></blockquote><br>\nWhy do you have to justify your vote? And why are RVS bandwagons bad. Correct me if I am wrong, but isn't that the reason for RVS?

I would be more inclined to believe that your reasons are/were legitimate if you came out and said, \"Look guys, Its rvs and the whole reason for rvs is to get a bandwagon going so we can get information, vote: largest wagon\". But no, you have to seemingly hide your vote off of random.com (which was <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">not</div> mentioned in your orginal post). So my question is:<br>\nDo you or do you not support the idea of an rvs? And why. I don't care if your answer is scummy as hell, all I want is your real answer, not hiding behind random.com and \"past games\".

Most likely you come from a place that has very short deadlines and where scum hunting isn't as encouraged.  The the advice of the guy with 3d glasses on darthvader, play a good portion of a \"noob\" (trust me they are just as competitive as normals) game and read the wiki and you should be fine.<br>\n2)generalizations hurt the town.

Thorough, calling people out on shit that needs to be called out, and putting the pressure pretty much where I'd like to see it put. However, where I differ is that I believe Elfen to be unreadable at this point. If he had more experience and was playing this way, I'd call him scum right off, but right now he seems desperate. It's really hard to get a read on a desperate person, as they're grasping for straws in the same way scum without valid reasoning do.

He's going to town hunt. Great, it's not like the mafia are trying to look like town. If you look for town attributes, you're going to find them in everyone. If you look for the tiny slip-ups that make people scum, you're doing more good for the town.

Bandwagoning, if you use the world properly, is when someone just votes for someone based on other peoples' reasoning, or for no reason at all except to get a lynch.

For obvious reasons, you don't want to lynch someone you have identified as Town. In addition, as you accumulate Town reads you can begin to lynch and argue from process of elimination. As long as your Town reads are accurate, process of elimination is one of the scariest things you can do to scum - now they not only have to look Town (which is already difficult for them), but they have to look more Town than others in order to evade your suspicion.<br>\n<br>\nOf course, this leaves the question of how to identify Townies.

I'm actually getting concerned about so many people throwing around 'X is confirmed [alignment]'.  Also, that's twice now you've voted for someone immediately after they voted you; it's not giving me any indication that my vote's in the wrong place.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Kalofer wrote:</cite>1) At the time everyone was either voting for elfen or trying to explain why elfen was scum, and a few weren't even in the game yet. Espeonage I saw as town, because he actually decided to go do something (townhunt with which I see nothing wrong) while everyone was too busy talking about elfen who I think is town. I didn't think it could lead to anything, it certainly couldn't have lead to a lynch that early and at best we would have gotten more info from reactions and taking our minds off of elfen.<br>\n2) Yes but he said it soon after and that only served to further illustrate my point. It may not be \"no mercy\" but it is intolerance and it got town bogged down in irrelevance, what was the point of having 5 votes on a person without it being decided whether he was going to be lynched or not? Waste of votes is what I'm trying to say I guess.<br>\n3) I don't think scum would give in to pressure after 2 votes during RVS and start telling us why they hate RVS.<br>\n4) There is no such thing as sure. I am null on chronos but he appears town.<br>\n5) This sentiment applies to everyone, who said it doesn't?</div></blockquote>What you keep doing is making statements about one player's alignment based on other player's alignments.  You don't have anything substantial.<br>\n<br>\n1) So you thought Espeonage was town ... since he wasn't attacking Elfen, who you thought was town.  Apart from wondering how you came so quickly to the conclusion that Elfen was town, why does <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">not</div> focussing on him make a player town?<br>\n2) Pressure, often given by multiple votes, leads to (generally) more talking and better reads.  We are not limited in how we can use our votes, so it's silly to talk of 'wasting' a vote.<br>\n3) Why not? Hating RVS would be non-indicative of alignment, so why would <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">saying</div> that you hate RVS be a town-motivated action?<br>\n4) So you immediately changed your vote solely on his suggestion ... why?<br>\n5) You implied it doesn't when you implied {Espeonage, Elfen} are town yet Elfen 'could be scum for all I know' and are happy to lynch him, wheras Espeonage seemingly could not be scum and you were happy to follow him.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI am mostly in agreement  with charter's post 297 and CooLskins' #299.  The main exception is that I think Kalofer is scummier than both The Kool and SleepyKrew.

I didn't think it could lead to anything, it certainly couldn't have lead to a lynch that early and at best we would have gotten more info from reactions and taking our minds off of elfen.<br>\n2) Yes but he said it soon after and that only served to further illustrate my point. It may not be \"no mercy\" but it is intolerance and it got town bogged down in irrelevance, what was the point of having 5 votes on a person without it being decided whether he was going to be lynched or not? Waste of votes is what I'm trying to say I guess.<br>\n3) I don't think scum would give in to pressure after 2 votes during RVS and start telling us why they hate RVS.<br>\n4) There is no such thing as sure.

I looked at my options but clearly didn't think things through. I understand being lynched today if it's in the town's best interests. I simply couldn't make a Pro-Kool game when asked to, and resorted to the only shred of proof I have. In my defense, I have seen it done on the site before. I still believe Kalofer and Esp to be scum, but understand completely what my actions may have caused.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhy do you think they are scum?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Panzerjager wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote:Quinnster</div> That's a cardinal sin in my book. Between blatant rolefishing and being over defensive of another player(buddying), I really think you're today's lynch and if you flip scum, we'd be certain kool is town(because why would scum rolefish a scum buddy).<br>\n<br>\nI highly recommend this because it gives us a ton more information then a Kool or Kalofer does at this point.<br>\n<br>\n@Supreme, I've been playing this game for a long time and I feel fairly confident in my ability to accurately read players as new as Elfen and Kool, mostly because they are being rather obvious. If Quinnster pops scum, I would have to eat my words on Kool, but I'm absolutely positive Elfen is town and I'm not sure there's much that could change my opinion(to the point if Quinn rolefished Elfen I would be calling for his lynch even more fervantly). I do agree with you that I shouldn't speak in absolutes during a game of mafia.</div></blockquote><br>\nAgreed, why would another person try to get a persons role(if they have a PR) unless they weren&#8217;t scum?? And Kool wasn&#8217;t even near a lynch&#8230; <br>\n<br>\nAlso, as for now(page 14) I think Kal may be leaning town-ish.

What good do you think it does to tell a doc to protect SK and for SK to kill Kool, even if he is a vig?<br>\n<br>\nElfen and cloudocean, just off the top of your head, who (2-3 people) strikes you as scummiest?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nSo far, SK, and quin<br>\n<br>\nsomewhat leaning scum but not there yet, kool kal<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Kalofer wrote:</cite>Oh btw if anyone's interested these are my reads:<br>\n<br>\n1) Charter - town, maybe he's going slightly overboard with trying to lynch SK but he is logical and consistent and his motivations seem town.<br>\n<br>\n2) Elfen - town, seems consistent with his newbiness at the very least. And although he's not doing very much I see no reason not to believe his \"OMG it's making my head explode!\" excuse. And at least he hasn't been silently creeping onto wagons like kool.<br>\n<br>\n3) CoolSkins - town, has been asking really good questions, really good cases and brought up really good points. <br>\n<br>\n4) LordChronos - town, consistent and seems town motivated, could be scum lying low and posting at opportune moments to try and look like town, but I wouldn't bet on it.<br>\n<br>\n5) Cloudocean - null/town, doesn't say much (townie efficiency or scum laying low), but is consistent and seems to have town motivations.<br>\n<br>\n6) The Kool - scum, plays the newb card, fair enough. But actions before that and need to justify vote for me as \"not just simple bandwagoning\" without providing adequate reasons looks scummy.<br>\n<br>\n7) Supreme Overlord - null/scum, asks unimportant questions to make himself look like he's town and trying to scumhunt. Seems like you're asking me questions to try and understand my logic but I'm starting to think you're purposely misunderstanding it. Enough people think I'm scum already, those who aren't voting for me aren't because they think other people are scummier, you are spending the majority of your time trying to make me look even scummier instead of actually scumhunting. <br>\n<br>\n8) SleepyKrew - null, could be an overly aggressive townie, could be overly aggressive scum trying to look like an overly aggressive townie, could be vig. <br>\n<br>\n9) Quinnster - null/scum, his defense could be a result of scum quickly giving in to pressure after realising what he did was wrong, or town honestly saying he's sorry after realising what he did was wrong. Still, his random conviction that kool was town along with the rolefishing are scummy enough moves by themselves.<br>\n<br>\n10) Espeonage - null, too secretive.<br>\n<br>\n11) Panzerjager - null, isn't really being scummy but seems too naive to be definite town to me.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n1) Yeah, I think he is leaning town, good reasonings.. But kind of bold to hastily vote SK, like you said.<br>\n<br>\n2) Umm, you tell me?<br>\n<br>\n3) Pfft, obtown, been  scum hunting, asking questions, basically leading the town.<br>\n<br>\n4) Umm, out of all of us (except that one dude) he has been rather lurking or hiding low if you say so to me. Not much out of his post (in the ISO 14 posts.) soo yeah. Any other thoughts on LC??<br>\n<br>\n5) Same of what Kal put.<br>\n<br>\n6) I really don&#8217;t know with this dude&#8230; acting just like me o-o<br>\n<br>\n7) I really don&#8217;t know on him.<br>\n<br>\n8) Yeah, I don&#8217;t like aggressive and his post have been to forward and to me, he has been doing odd things. Wanting to lynch a person right then and there and so forth.<br>\n<br>\n9)The role fishing thing was just absurd.. <br>\n<br>\n10) I am confused with his post @_@<br>\n<br>\n11) Neutral, plain and simple.<br>\n<br>\nAlso @ocean cloud.

I'm really interested in this elfen/sleepykrew argument, especially with Necessary Evil's quick interjections. I understand trying to stir the pot, but he could be more specific.</div></blockquote><br>\nIn the second post, he was doing the EXACT SAME THING he was getting on my case about with the first.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Quinnster wrote:</cite>However, where I differ is that I believe Elfen to be unreadable at this point. If he had more experience and was playing this way, I'd call him scum right off, but right now he seems desperate. It's really hard to get a read on a desperate person, as they're grasping for straws in the same way scum without valid reasoning do. We've backed him into a corner and seen that he caves a bit under pressure. Good, now we know, let's move on.</div></blockquote><br>\nIt seems he was one of the ones to really advocate the backing off of Elfen, though oddly enough this was AFTER people had already backed off, and he didn't even say he was town.  All he said was \"He's desperate, okay, move on,\" as if mafia aren't far more likely to get desperate than townies.  And then people moved on, and have forever since called Elfen town, mostly based on variations of that reasoning right there.  Of course, this could mean he's right, but I get a bad vibe from it, so I'm including it.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Quinnster wrote:</cite>Oh I have my own town reads right now. I think Sleepykrew is town, based on the fact that he's been on the same train of thought I have. What I don't agree with is townhunting as an alternative to scumhunting. We need to be doing both, all the time.</div></blockquote><br>\nThat's a BS reason to think someone is town.  Anybody can come up with the same reasons that people have already said, especially mafia.  Thinking he is town because you agree with his reasoning is total BS, and makes you look scummy alongside him.<br>\n<br>\nHe has also gotten REALLY snarky at times, especially #247.  This doesn't in itself mean he's mafia, but it's not helpful to the town.  While getting rid of him because he isn't going to be helpful isn't valid anymore, because he was rep[laced, it still indicates that he didn't have a very pro-town mindset, which indicates that he didn't have a pro-town role.<br>\n<br>\n#284, he instantly comes out trying to ingratiate himself with me with assurances that he's on my side, FAR more than he had ever done with anyone previously, or in fact than anyone else had done.  He then tried to use this... lemme quote again.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Quinnster wrote:</cite>Okay, The Kool. Here's what it comes down to. I was asked why I find you so pro-town, so I went back and read your ISO. You're playing really scummy, and I honestly can't blame people for finding you suspicious. However, I don't want to waste today's lynch on someone I believe so strongly to be pro-town. I want you to claim. I suspect that you've been breadcrumbing, and that's the only reason I have for finding you pro-town. If you're a PR, claim now so we don't lose a townie today and another tonight.</div></blockquote><br>\nEverything about this post is all wrong.  He says he find me town, but that he can't find any reason for it, and I look totally scummy, but he still believes beyond a doubt that I am town.  He then tries to get my role, especially if I have a PR, for BOGUS reasoning!  According to his earlier statements about bandwagons, he has no need to be concerned that I'm going to get lynched, and having me claim a power role, if I am one, only assures that the mafia will be able to kill a power role tonight, instead of having to guess.<br>\n<br>\nHe then comes back, when called on this post, to say he can't defend himself, and he isn't even going to try, and plays the stupid card.  He says his actions were inexcusable.  He then says that he is willing to die for this mistake.  That is something townies sometimes are, but in my experience, only the stupid or the mafia ever say, as a last resort to make people think they really are town.  Either case, if they really are willing to die, we might as well oblige them.<br>\n<br>\nWhen asked for a read, he comes back with less than half a dozen posts of reference (#335).<br>\n<br>\nWe then get no further read on him, because he seeks a replacement, and Ear refuses to vouch for him.  Ear plays better town, but he's asking us to ignore Quinn and all his mistakes and slip-ups, in the hope that he can do things better.<br>\n<br>\nHonestly, this is a far stronger read than I ever had on Kalofer, but that doesn't mean I suspect Kal any less.  If we start voting for Ear, I'll vote for him too at first opportunity, but right now my vote is on Kal with the rest of the majority.  Better him then me, right?  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">", "time": "Mon May 23, 2011 4:31 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17498&start=450", "forum": "53", "thread": "17498"}

So you wanted to lynch charter (who flipped town I might add) simply because he was suspicious of you? I have suspicions of you, why don't you want to lynch me? I have been after you for a while now, why don't you want to lynch me? I have a feeling that the second reason is just to cover up your real motive for wanting charter (and using the same logic, <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">me</div> us [damn hydra] lynched). Your real motive for wanting charter lynched is to get rid of people who suspect you. <br>\n<br>\nAnd you should never vote for someone just because your wagon failed, you should always be voting for your number 1 read, unless deadline/special mechanics would make it unwise for you to do so. And farther more, no one was going to lynch charter. There is/was even less support for a charter lynch then for a kal lynch.

They don't have to listen if they don't want to.<br>\n<br>\ninb4 \"LOL WOW ITS SO OBVIOUS WHY DONT U GET IT\"</div></blockquote><br>\nDirecting power roles is something Mafia can easily do in order to protect their fellow mafia from vigkills, or to direct cops away from them, all while trying to seem like town.  It is not a very good idea to accept direction from anyone you don't know is town, if you are a PR.<br>\n<br>\nIn other news, CooLskins is presenting some solid logic, in addition to previously presented logic, to which I have nothing to add, other than that my poorly put together read on Kalofer still stands, thanks to my gut.  The interaction between SK and Kal could be some serious distancing, but I doubt it.  If SK flips scum as I suspect, then I'll believe Kal isn't mafia, at about an 8 on the aforementioned scale.  Doesn't mean he couldn't be serial killer, but I don't believe he is working with SK.<br>\n<br>\nOn another note, it would be deliciously ironic if SleepyKrew were a Serial Killer.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: SleepyKrew</span><br>\n<br>\nThat said, why are you so firm on Panzer, Esp?

You are blindly lynching people without anilzing their posts to try to gain town credit. </div></blockquote><br>\nAnd what's even more, I have looked, and not seen one post of yours after this that explained your dead-set attitude to lynching him.  Closest it came was so:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Espeonage wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote, vote: Panzer</div><br>\n<br>\nReread what you have read in the last page and make a nice little case on why you aren't scum and if I like I won't try and derail Ear's wagon.</div></blockquote><br>\nNow, do us all a favor and actually explain your case, if you even have one?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">FoS: Espeonage</div><br>\n<br>\nAlso, hiplop, as much as I hate to suspect you for voting for the same guy as me, that sounds a heluva lot like sheeping.

That is my style, waiting for information to pass by then go at it, not try to strive for it when I know I won't able to get it. I dont give a flying shit if other people vote for other people, that is fine by me, it gives me a chance to see why and what was the consequences in the action they had. I just don't want people to say that I am scum cause I don't vote and all. But for some reason they do.<br>\n<br>\nDoes that answer some of it?? If not Tell my what else I need to explain further</div></blockquote><br>\nSo you're willing to just sit back and let a townie get lynched on day 1?  You're not even going to try to find scum?  T<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">hat may not be inherently scummy</div>, but it sure ain't pro-town.</div></blockquote><br>\nThis just got my attention right off the bat. Getting townies lynched is the essence of playing scum. Could this be a \"theory point\" to justify later actions? Probably not, but I still find it interesting that Kool doesn't think lynching townies is scummy.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Espeonage 129 wrote:</cite>Btw.

This is especially true in the early game when you have no real reads. From what I read so far today (pages 5-13) people were defending each other right and left when they really had no basis for their town reads. It is one thing to say \"I don't like that particular lynch because of x\" and another to say, \"X can't possibly be scum because he is so obv town for these reasons.\" One is arguing that their are better lynches out their (my scum reads) the other is arguing that a player is town...<br>\n<br>\nNow that was probably poorly worded so let me explain farther.<br>\n<br>\nPressure is always good. Putting somebody under pressure is always a good thing. The town always gets information out of it (the game is in fact the uninformed minority verses the informed minority). Somebody else defending another player lessens that pressure and hurts the town. It also allows for the person being questioned to say \"ohh yeah, exactly what he said\". That doesn't give the town any information does it? It doesn't even give the town a hint of a motive. It is also a way for scum buddies to help each other from getting lynched. <br>\n<br>\nLets take this example.<br>\n<br>\nA noob scum player comes into a game and makes a bad post. Somebody questions him about it and he answer poorly. The same person attacks him on his answers. The noob's scum bud comes in and answer for him and defends his actions.

Out of 3 scum only one makes a kill. So you have a 33% chance of blocking scum's kill. Why are you clearing Sleepy over a 33% chance? On top of this, in you 903 you essentially agree that Sleepy isn't cleared and you should have never said he was, yet still say \"good job reading your post\" like you did the right thing, you didn't. You unvoted someone that still had a 66% chance of being scum given your result. To be honest with you, the post you agreed with in 903, is most of my arguement why you are scum.<br>\n<br>\nC. Actually you didn't. Both me and Chronos unvoted and voted elsewhere.<br>\n<br>\nD. Where? <br>\n<br>\nE. No I'm coming at you because you're lying about a PR<br>\n<br>\nF. Ad Hom(again reeks of OMGUS). Also, what breadcrumbs? The ones where you confuse half of us by making us think you were an info role? The one where you say Sleepy is cleared when he isn't? The one where you then say that you aren't an info role but he's cleared still? <br>\n<br>\nG. What? You realize that most of Day 1 I was all over both sleepy and Kalofer, right? Just as everyone else, I've mentioned CO as lurkerscum. I really don't see how this statement of your is true. Essentially while accusing me of twisting your words, You have (on several occasions) accused me of things that are just plain untrue. Further evidence that it is you that is voting me to cover up your piss poor play.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n@Cloudocean's last post: okay it's not a compelling case, but your play is indicative of scum.

But we can't really find that out unless we lynch one. But if we lynch somebody and they flip town then we lose the game. Basically we can lynch today and win or lose the game, or we can no lynch and hope that hip's/panzer's jk blocks the scum kill and then we lynch them the next day. However, the later is flawed because both hip and confirmed town espy have said that they have been role-blocked. This means that the scum will role block the person that they know is the real jk (ether panzer or hip). <br>\n<br>\nSo in essence right now we have a 50/50 on our hands. Both hip and panzer can't be town. One of them is scum. Now is the time that we go back and dig up voting records and the claims that both have made in order to make an informed decision and tip the odds on that 50/50. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nBub has a draft saved here that has some reads that aren't finished yet, so expect those from him later.

{"number": 1015, "id": "3127903", "user": "CooLskins", "user_id": "14502", "content": "I think what CooLDoG was saying, was that we would have gained much more information from an SK flip rather than what we got. CO had virtually no connects to anybody, and while he was the SK, his lynch didn't get as any closer to finding scum at all.<br>\n<br>\nAt any rate, the issue we have right now is either Panzer or hip. We have confirmed scum in one of them. While we could go anywhere else, I don't think we'd have as good a shot as 50%+. For that reason, I've re-read Panzer response to hip's claim, to see if it is consistent with him being a jailer. After Hip posted his claim that SK didn't have a killing role, Panzer was on him, and then off him.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Panzer wrote:</cite>Sudden epiphany:I'd be willing to bet Hipplop is lying, Seems weird that he would vote Sleepy after getting a result on him with gunsmith. Also SK's are generally considered not to have guns so He wouldn't sense the SK(they carry knives in most games here)</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nHe seems to weakly think that Hiplop is lying (if he strongly felt that way, he would have voted for him). This is interesting, because at this point it is assumed that Hip is a gunsmith. This could be town-panzer saying \"Hmmm, could there really be a watcher, tracker, gunsmith, Jailer, and three scum in a 13 player game?\" while also make a point about hiplop's voting, which brings further questions to his claim. He's on his case for a few more posts and then he drops him when the hoopla dies down a little. <br>\n<br>\nHowever he gets back onto hip later for getting onto the Kool wagon too fast. After that, Hiplop claimes jailkeeper, and Panzer responds with this:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Panzer wrote:</cite>Bullshit<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote:Hiplop</div></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAnd then later:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Panzer wrote:</cite>No, You can't mistake what he is claiming to have mistook. Every vote on someone that is voting on you isn't OMGUS<br>\n<br>\nUnless the Mod took some serious liberties with the way the role PM was written(or the English language), there is no way you could have missed the fact that Jailkeeping someone roleblocks them. Also, that's essentially the main way to play jailkeeper, is use it as an RB role.<br>\n<br>\nThe actions and the claim do not add up. Either this is a lying scum or a lying SK. But one way or another, Hiplop is not a jailkeeper.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI view both of these as strong evidence that Panzer is telling the truth. You would expect him to instantly get onto Hip, like a switch had been flipped, once Hip claimed jailkeeper. The assertation that he wasn't the jailkeeper was strong, and IMO, not supported by the evidence he presented. This leads me to belive that he was the jailer himself.<br>\n<br>\nHe keeps on pushing hard on hip, insisting that he's scum. However, he relents a little when he sees the hiplop wagon going nowhere and gets onto the CO wagon. Overall, I see a generally consistent view from Panzer, and exactly what I would expect from the real town jailkeeper in that circumstance. When hiplop claims jailer, Panzer flips and starts attacking him all out like never before. While he does relent in the end, I feel like this was after he realized that the wagon wasn't going anywhere and he consents to a CO lynch. After that, he knows he's got to get hiplop lynched because he knows that hip is scum (and it's MYLO) so he comes out and counter-claims.<br>\n<br>\nThis is much better than Hiplop's kind of wishy-washy claim. Looking back, it looks more like a botched attempt to either protect a possible scumbud (SK) or gain some town cred. Either way, Hip is scum. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote: Hiplop</div><br>\n<br>\nPanzer claim is much more consistent and believable than hip's, thus making hip the liar (and the scum).<br>\n<br>\nI also really don't like this most recent post by Hip.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Hiplop wrote:</cite>nice find chronos.

Actually its a bit closer to 100% but that another story.<br>\nSK kill: town<br>\nscum kill town <br>\n2/1/1 <br>\nThis would have been a very interesting situation. Scum actually have motivation to work with the town to avoid  sk draw-win (2x cross kill would be very funny wouldn't it?). But the town have to lynch scum to avoid a loss (scum kill town, 1/1 draw, possible loss depending on mod). SO we would have a potential hold out from the two townies if they realized the situation. Get a no lynch and then scum have to kill the sk (at this point you are just throwing up your hands and hoping that scum hit sk and sk hits scum. Because otherwise you are going to run into a draw/loss)<br>\ncorrect lynch here is no lynch. Then you put your faith in the remaining scum to kill the sk. Then you have a 2/1 lylo. <br>\n<br>\nMy conclusion is as follows. IF we lynched sk instead of CO we would have had a hell of a lot more time to make reads and prepare for lylo. Its still essentially a coin flip (as we know it is right now. Hindsight works here because that is what my comment was made in), and it would have been a hell of a lot better going into lylo with only 1 scum instead of 3 (this is a pretty big assumption). But natuarlly killing the sk early will allow us a road to victory if we can lynch 3 scum in a row. All in all It would all still rest on a 50/50 coin flip (ether on sk/panzr/hip yeas due to the connections...). And arguably the town have a chance at winning here, and in most other cases (where no cross kills happen) the town draw-loses. But the fact remains we have to lynch 3 scum in a row on a basic 50/50. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">mod, prod the shit out of kal</div>", "time": "Tue Jun 14, 2011 2:42 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17498&start=1000", "forum": "53", "thread": "17498"}

Looking forward to future games with all of you, though i hope id be on the same side next time (to panzer, and coolskins).  I hope you all learn from this for future play and stuff.", "time": "Tue Jun 14, 2011 10:15 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17498&start=1025", "forum": "53", "thread": "17498"}
