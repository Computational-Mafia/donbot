{"forum": "53", "thread": "23262", "pagelink": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23262&start=0", "number": "1", "timestamp": "Mon Sep 03, 2012 4:00 pm", "user": "LlamaFluff", "content": "Rules<br><br>[01] VOTING METHOD: Votes must be in bold. example: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: LlamaFluff</span> If you do not bold your vote, it will not be counted. You do not have to <span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote </span>before casting another vote, but it would be appreciated.<br><br>[02] LYNCH: Lynching will require a simple majority of votes. Once a player has reached the necessary majority, any attempts to unvote will be unheeded. <br><br>[03] NO LYNCH: You may <span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: no lynch </span>\u2013 unless it is deadline, majority votes of this kind are necessary to end the day without a death.<br><br>[04] DEADLINE: This game will have mandatory deadlines of, at most, 2 weeks. As the game whittles down its living membership deadlines may grow shorter. If I deem it necessary a player being replaced may extend the deadline. <br><br>[05] DEADLINE LYNCH RULES: At deadline, a person will be lynched if they have a majority of voters voting for them. That means you can be lynched with just one vote if only one person is voting. If no one has a majority of the votes cast, it is a no-lynch. <br><br>[06] NIGHT CHOICES: Night choices will be expected within 48 hours. If you do not inform me of a night choice you will forfiet it. <br><br>[07] LURKING AND NOT POSTING: Lurking is not an acceptable strategy in this game. Anyone who goes more than 48 hours without posting, without advance warning, will be prodded. Failure to post in the 48 hours following a prod will result in a player being replaced. Mafia is a social contract. Everyone is expected to give information and comment to be analysed. If this is uncomfortable for you, consider taking up solitaire instead.<br><br>[08] OUT OF THREAD COMMUNICATION: The game is not to be discussed outside the thread unless your role specifically states that you may do so \u2013 and then only in the manner stated in your role PM. Don\u2019t quote any out-of-thread communications regarding this game in the thread, this includes role PMs. <br><br>[09] BAH POSTS ARE ALLOWED: Once your death scene has been posted, you\u2019re dead. However, since I love Bah posts you may absolutely make one \"Bah\" post. It should be short and should contain absolutely no game related opinion or information. <br><br>[10] TOO CLEVER BY HALF RULE: No small or hidden text or obscure codes. Don\u2019t edit/delete previously submitted posts either. <br><br>[11] VACATION? LIMITED ACCESS? If you anticipate being unavailable for more than a 48-hour period, please post a notice to that effect in this game thread. Treat this game as a commitment. Be considerate \u2013 don\u2019t leave us hanging. <br><br>[12] FALLIBILITY CLAUSE: Unlike other mods I am fallible. Please point out any mistakes I make gently. In particular, if I post a vote count that does not accurately reflect your vote, it is your responsibility to correct me -- otherwise your vote may be treated as it appears in the vote count. <br><br>[13] QUESTIONS: If you have any questions at all, please PM me or post the question in the thread. <br><br>[14] HUSH NOW, QUIET NOW: Excessive use of CAPS POSTING or spamming posts will not be allowed and may result in replacement without warning.<br><br>[15] GAMBLERS ANON: No bets, deals, promises, etc are allowed. Depending on the severity of one you may be modkilled or forceably replaced.<br><br>[16] IF IT QUACKS LIKE A DUCK: If you fake breaking a rule, it will result in the same punishment as actually breaking the rule.<br><br>[17] FUN: Remember, it\u2019s a game and it\u2019s supposed to be fun. Be nice to your fellow players and your mod. I have very low tolerance for abusive posts. <br><br>[18]<span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"> I've reserved this color for any purposes I might choose.

And my buddying accusation was admittedly \"slightly better than random.\"  This post feels like you are either trying to make it into a more serious attack than it actually was, or were just going through the posts and finding whatever to throw into a post, so that you could post while putting in minimal effort (the FoS of Hoopla leads me to believe the latter).  <br></div></blockquote><br>This post set off some bells. I think it seems like a bit of an overreaction, but at this point I can't decide if its knee-jerk omgus or just overly explaining your vote logic.

That right there is enough reason to not take it as a declaration of guilt. It may be scummy, or anti-town, but that's really far off from scum outing themselves. Additionally, a town-aligned player shouldn't be concerned with \"catching shit\". In fact, catching shit early is a great way to get the game moving, and I've seen self-votes employed by good and bad players, scum and town alike, for this purpose. <br><br>\"I love when scum gives up day 1, never seen it done this quickly though.\"<br>\"I've seen town do it, including myself\"<br>You're definitely not adding up here.

I wasn't really \"pushing\" Elias's \"case\", I was just saying I agreed with his observation of the tone of Starbuckles post. If you must know, I am a little suspicious of Starbuckles who happened to be my RVS vote, but as for having strong reads I like giving people the benefit of the doubt because you know the majority of us <span style=\"font-style: italic\">are</span> town, and I really believe games are won as much on shared town reads and town listening to each other as anything else. I'm generally a lot more inactive in RVS than this game, but its the only game I'm in and I may as well try to break that habit of laziness. Also not sure why you would lol at me keeping my RVS vote, if I wasn't still voting Starbuckles, I'd be voting no one. I think the \"vote so and so for a reaction\" as a way to start every game is superficial and fruitless most of the time anyways. I do think we got some reactions from CO2 that make him more likely to be town, but meh. Also, the wagon on Hoopla is kinda meh. As people said, she's been around the block a time or two on here, so not sure what we are expecting running her up to L-1/L-2, did we really get any useful info? I know I didn't -___-. And I tend to be a more cautious townie especially in terms of my vote. I don't vote flippantly past RVS. Sooo...yea. <br><br>CO2, you should still contribute. I understand not wanting to draw all the attention to yourself, but you don't need to completely lay in the weeds."}

When I make my first change out of RVS it will be a serious \"I think this person is scum and actually want them lynched\" vote.

I feel like I was kind of attributing a lot of my town read on him to some newbie tells in regards to lingo/buddying. But the more I think about it, that's not really alignment revealing, he very well could be not familiar with lingo and still be scum. There are some of his posts that generally feel town to me, but I had him as a town-lock earlier and I'm questioning that read to an extent.<br><br>As for Hoopla, maybe I'm expecting too much from her, but the whole self-vote and the way the wagon fizzled out just feels a bit off to me. I still stand by that the wagon on her was kinda silly at the time, but I don't know, I know it may be \"obvious\" as to why she was self-voting to her, but I don't know part of being town is being seen as town by other townies and she seems kind of closed off to explaining her full motives. I'd like it if she just kind of let us know what she was thinking completely, because as far as I'm concerned, its possible she's scum. Plus, I know this might be hypocritical coming from me, but I would have expected Hoopla to come in here with a reads post by now.<br><br>My scum read on Starbuckles is mostly gut. Nothing about her play is blatantly scummy, but I kind of sense that at times she's holding back a bit. Completely gut, no proof, not my top choice for a lynch today, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if she were scum.<br><br>Demoncore's vote on me is a safe vote. In that, it's easily explainable (omg fencesitting). I feel out of the people who do want to lynch me, demon is the vote that seems the sketchiest, its seems like a bandwagon vote and unlike scooby (or even dun) I don't get the feeling that he is legitimately suspicious of me. I don't know, I could be wrong, but not liking his vote at all., especially the way he was trying to gain support for a lynch wagon on me. If you are asking other people to join the wagon you are on, you would think he would have more conviction in terms of his vote on me and all I see as a reason is that I'm \"fencesitting\" which I feel I have been over multiple times in terms of what to expect as far as a contribution from me.<br><br>Ranmaru asked me @Scumhunter: Opinions on Mcstab, Nadro, and CarbonDioxide? Since we are almost 10 pages in, would you consider voting Mcstab? I think they are all town, it felt to me that he could be trying to gain support for whichever one of these wagons would be the easiest mislynch. I had thought my vote would be going for him when I was reviewing at first, but I find Demon Core's vote on me and his feel towards my wagon to be a lot more sketch to me. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote, vote Demon Core</span>"}

I did think it was odd that he posted everything sketchy about Hoopla down to petty details, but I mean he was just reviewing the people voting him and it looked to me like he was thinking outloud in terms of looking at the people voting him and trying to see if there was anything sketchy about them.

Also, I think towns #1 job is to appear town to the rest of the town (even more so than catching scum!), so I think at times it could look like I'm overly concerned with making sure that people have a town read on me, and I probably do focus on that more than most people do as town, but whatever. Not asking you to trust me 100%, but I am asking for a little faith in terms of not lynching me today and at least considering I could be town and lynching elsewhere.

I still don't really see much of a case on me beyond the original one or two points, some gutfeels that go unexplained, some pressure votes to get me to pickup content despite people like Hoopla still never posting good content, and now I'm getting flak for targeting people on my wagon. I've explained myself to as many of these points as possible. I could jump on a DemonCore wagon, and if it was him or me a Scumhunter wagon, but I would much much prefer a Hoopla wagon forming; her lack of content is problematic and her self-voting was a bad joke at best, a smart move to disintegrate her wagon at worst.<br><br>When's deadline?"}

Here is what I think is happening:<br><br>I think there is one scum on the Mcstab Wagon, and one off the wagon. Who do I think that is? None other than Dumhamhammer! (I realized this a while ago [when he said stop voting mcstab] and was waiting for him to answer my questions to announce my read change, but deadline is near and I'm putting my thoughts out NOW) Now try to remember back early in D1, tell me your thoughts on his push on Starbuckles. What was his reason again? Oh yeah, he noticed that Starbuckles had been 'focusing' too hard on Mcstab. <br><br><span style=\"color: #FF4000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Nice, your case against me amounts to a false active lurking accusation and an associative link prior to any flips.

That's why I get a scum vibe from Dumhamhammer, since he also stopped his 'analysis' to vote me for giving a list of reads.

From his original post I see the reasoning he explained. Why do you agree with McStab's 2nd point when you disagree with his first? You even go as far as answering for Val. I can understand that it is odd he would clarify the vote as pressure, but the reasoning is still there in my opinion.<br><br>Rob's forceful suspicion of the people in the game, Hoopla, then nad, then scooby looks to be town. Given the pressure Elias is giving him, and his interaction by continuing to answer Elias along with his vote pattern, I do not think Rob is mafia.

It's at least somewhat understandable to lynch a town read over yourself at deadline (especially if you are a town powerrole). I think him saying that makes sense and would be a pretty easy point for you to try and attack as scum. Your posts are zinging my scumdar some :3. I mean you say there are better options other than DemonCore...but then you don't really give any other options?? I feel your comments towards me and McStab have a little zing to them in that they are latently aggressive but I still can't tell if you think either of us are scum or what you are thinking. I'm pretty okay with seeing Starbuckles be lynched right now.<br><br>@Dunham, the post you quoted of Starbuckles hit my scumdar as well and I think its LOL that you think whatever it is I've done is scummier than that. The original suspicion on me as far as I can tell was for not providing reads right away and being a fencesitter/passive. I was pretty damn straightforward about my play even before I was suspected that it takes time for me to jump into the game and that I'm careful with votes. And yea, it did take me time to get into the game but I feel like my play has been pretty darn straightforward in that I've pretty much followed through on what I've been saying the whole time.

Hoopla's statement has no visible context and serves as a soft statement of calling nad town. Her statement is so unusual, so uncalled for, that I think it has malicious intent. Hoopla has been pressured a fairly decent amount at this point in the game. It stands there is a likely chance that she will be lynched. Should she be lynched at that point, and she flips scum, the town will have very little to go off. Except for the odd comments that she makes. I am of the opinion that she is saying these statements to tie herself to potential mislynches in the future.<br><br>However, I do not understand why Hoopla as scum would not simply start ... contributing.

As scum, I feel it would be easier for him to simply lurk, as he claims he does it anyway and let the Hoopla pressure continue. He is inserting himself into the middle of Rob v. Hoopla which I do not think a scum member would want. The only reasonable explanation I can create is that Scumhunter wants credit from Hoopla or in other words a nonverbal agreement with her about his supposed alignment.<br><br>I know that makes no sense after reading it.

One point in particular that he points is that she did not look at this activity across the site as whole as a possible explanation for his lack of activity in this game. The attack comes from annoyance and anger toward Starbuckles for focusing on him and solely him. I feel that McStab is experienced enough to realize that his type of reaction, attacking the person attacking him, will only make people look at him. He puts himself in the spot light. He acts without regard for the spotlight, a common act that I think scum fail to realize separates their town play and their scum play. Of course, then they overcompensate and go in for the kill much too early. <br><br>McStab's post is pro town. The only issue I have is that McStab says all of these things about Starbuckles but does not follow through with a vote on her. Instead targetting Hoopla in his next post. This somewhat undermines my previous opinion as that does show some acknowledgement of how his actions will be perceived and some care for what others will think of him. I know that he says he does not think scum will have the gall to do what Starbuckles did, but did she not say she is new?<br><br>McStab, if you would, how many times have you been mafia on this site? Were you given advice on how to play scum by your partners in those games?<br><br>Starbuckles, why did you feel the need to respond to scooby's comment about himself in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4335076#p4335076\" class=\"postlink\">this post?</a> <br><br>And what do you mean by <span style=\"font-style: italic\">both</span> scum? Also, would you have not seen scooby's post in the preview ability of this forum? This part is referencing your final line of thought.<br><br>Scooby's supposed guilty is attention grabbing, and as I have said before an act that scum are unlikely to do. I am withholding complete judgment of his action given the situational relevance of the guilty until I have finished my read through. Sorry I am so slow guys. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"><br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4335468#p4335468\" class=\"postlink\">Ranmaru's play</a> reminds me of myself.

However, your tone in the statements addressing him is not accusatory or suspicious. Why? I know this may not be easy to answer and is probably a personality thing but it is something I felt worth mentioning.<br><br>We have many aggressive players in my opinion. BT notices the odd comment that Starbuckles made about \"both\" scum. His push against the other players in the <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4335584#p4335584\" class=\"postlink\">post</a> displays his intent to examine the game and most likely a derives itself from a town mindset.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4336154#p4336154\" class=\"postlink\">How do you know this Kingdom?</a><br><br>Reminder to myself to go back and reread BT's case and Elias response to Ranmaru.

I mean feel free to look through my other games though too if you'd like.  With regards to Hoopla-scum lining up theoretical mislynches...its why I wouldn't read too much into what conf-scum say after they flip. I think its a lot better to look at other people's reactions towards the conf-scum as opposed to vice versa. Lynched scum have less to lose in a way and more of an incentive to distance since they know they won't actually have to follow through on the distancing with lynching their partner(s) because they will be dead by then...<br><br>Oh and I wouldn't really call my play passive. That's kind of unfair. I have decent results and I mean I like to think I'm thoughtful and careful but I'm not afraid to push a lynch if I think I'm right. I take time to get involved and its because I don't like getting involved in early day 1 bickering, thats pretty much it. It tears towns apart all too often. And I am paranoid that I'm wrong all the time. But overthinking is better than underthinking any day in my book.<br><br>Cartographer, I'd suggest you review Starbuckles because I do think her scumhunting is pretty weak and a lot of her posts are aimed at taking potshots at people as opposed to really being concerned with finding scum. Plus I do think it could be a slip when she said \"both\" of the scum was was pointed out. 2 scum + SK would make a lot of sense given 12 players really, plus that would also explain not having a lot of firm scum reads as a SK would be able to scumhunt pretty naturally at least in the beginning. Maybe too much setup speculation, but maybe not. I really think Starbuckles is the best lynch right now though.<br><br>Scooby, anytime you want to get over your confirmation bias, review the thread, and start using your brain, feel free."}

(It was my fault due to only reading the first line). His joke towards Kingdom felt like weak justification to get on Hoopla, and to connect himself to Kingdom. I felt there may have been a chance of Kingdom and him being buddies because I also found Kingdom scummy for some of his statements.<br><br>Now then.

I don't think I really say it like that, I just feel it's implied from my push on him. The only time I try to re-inforce the \"he's scum\" thing is when asking Scooby to vote him for me.

Its primary use would be to act as a pseudo-Role Cop, but if most of the town is vanilla, why give it to scum? If the claim is true (which I think it is), I actually think its likelier that it's coming from a town player, as there is more overall value to the role as it can track other town PR's or scum, as opposed to 1 or 2 town PR's.

I'd be surprised if there's more than one scum on buckles' wagon.  It's fairly sure there's at least one on there but I'm thinking two at most... assuming there are more than two scum.  If there's &gt;2 scum on Starbuckle's wagon then they just greatly reduced their odds of being found by killing BT.<br><br>I'm going back to analyse those that <span class=\"noboldsig\">didn't</span> vote for Starbuckles and are probably sitting in a puddle of self congratulation right now: scooby; Hoopla and the non-voting Elias_the_thief &amp; KingdomAces."}

I'll caveat it by saying this game is showing a glaring difference between my newbie game(s).  Playing with a host of more experienced players is certainly leaving me more in the dark!<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">On the wagon</span><br><br>Let's start with those on the 'buckles wagon: BT, Scumhunter, McStab, Ranmaru, Carbondioxide, Dunhumganger, Cartographer.<br><br>We can discount BT (dead) and me (guess what Kingdom... I say I'm Town...  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_surprised2.gif\" alt=\":o\" title=\"Surprised\"> )<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Scumhunter</span> \u2014 personally I haven't seen anything which has set my scum-dar pinging... other than the general fence-sitting.  If McStab <span class=\"noboldsig\">is</span> a Town 1-shot tracker and Scumhunter did stay home... I'm not sure what that tells us.  If he's scum he sent Goons killing.  If he's town, he's probably vanilla.  50/50 call.  In hindsight <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4350287#p4350287\" class=\"postlink\">post 357</a> expressing lots of confidence in the 'buckles wagon looks bad... but by that point 'buckles was pretty much screwed anyway so why, as scum, post to say that?<br><br>Also, he posts a <span class=\"noboldsig\">lot</span>.  Way more than anyone else and for someone who, by their own admission 'takes a while to warm up' this seems odd and out of character.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">McStab</span> \u2014 I voted for him early on but his claim put me (and others off).  If he's scum that was smart.  The 1-shot tracker thing could be a magical bluff and now he's tracked Scumhunter and reported back he must be nailed on Town, right?  I dunno... something still doesn't sit quite right there.  That said, if Scumhunter's a PR and McStab took a wild guess, hoping he was right... hmmm.  I'm prepared to give McStab the benefit of the doubt for now.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Ranmaru</span> \u2014 hasn't posted for a long, long while... which, given they replaced in and hadn't had much time to post before doesn't help me a great deal with a read on them. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4342134#p4342134\" class=\"postlink\">post #283</a> still strikes me as odd but has otherwise posted some fairly helpful scum-reads.  Again, benefit of the doubt for now.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Dunhumganger</span> \u2014 might just be a playing style thing but has this whole \"I'm so clever\" thing going on which, whilst possibly Town isn't that helpful Town... certainly not to me, as a comparative newbie.  Votes along the lines of \"voting x is also fine\" like he's the unappointed Town spokesperson/King is just odd.  I mean, most of his posts make me laugh but they're not overly helpful.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Cartographer</span> \u2014 has gone to Town on the analysis too, which gives me Townie-tingles.  Dropping the hammer on Starbuckles, confusingly, strengthens my town-read on him.  Given the deadline was looming Starbuckle's would have died anyway... so why drop the hammer and put a big scum mark on your head if you were scum... totally unnecessary, so therefore motivations more likely to be Town.<br><br>-----<br>So, by my own logic (above) at least one of those must be scum.  At this point I haven't got a strong scum-read on any of them.  If I had a gun to my head I'd order them: Scumhunter; Dunham; Ranmaru; McStab; Cartographer.  <br><br>On to those not on the wagon: scooby; Hoopla; and (more glaringly by not voting at all): Elias_the_thief &amp; KingdomAces.<br><br>Maybe this is newbiely simplistic of me but if I were scum I'd think: \"Way to avoid suspicion and even omgus attention... I won't vote at all! Mwa-ha-ha-haaaa!\" \u2014 that makes me look at Elias and Kingdom first:<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Elias</span> \u2014 has gone awful quiet of late too, which is pretty unhelpful.  However, recent posts pointing out Town-reads, in the absence of waving fingers of suspicion at scum-reads, strikes me as townie behaviour.  Something scum tend to do is subtly get wagons rolling on the next Town player.  Granted, a good way to do this might be steer wagons away from their scum-buddies but I get a townie read from it.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Kingdom</span> \u2014 looks fishier to me.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4351319#p4351319\" class=\"postlink\">post #369</a> he says Starbuckles is the \"best lynch\", dangles his \"intent to hammer\"; posts twice subsequently <span class=\"noboldsig\">without</span> hammering and instead Cartographer does the deed.  Why, if you think someone is the \"best lynch\", would you avoid dropping the hammer?  Perhaps to avoid looking scummy?<br><br>Meh... even I'm not happy with that analysis.  I certainly don't feel happy enough with it to vote on it.  I need to do some more reading/thinking.<br><br>(Kingdom, I just saw your reply whilst I was typing all this... I'll respond in a separate post)."}

I was trying to guess at how many scum are on there. 1-in-6; 2-in-6? 3-in-6?

Why would you throw away that position as scum? Being read as innocent in a town full of apathetic lurkers is a recipe for success as scum. The only caveat is Rob possibly being one of those players that values the integrity and social aspect of the game so highly, that he'd throw away a winning position if he felt he wasn't being challenged in a fair way. I don't think that's impossible, but it's way more likely that he was just an extremely frustrated townie - I'd be willing to stake the game on that read.<br><br>The roles we've had flipped and claimed (Doctor and 1-shot Tracker) gel perfectly with a 2:10 setup - these are exactly the sort of roles you'd likely see, and with a lack of second nightkill, I find it unlikely we've got a Serial Killer. Unless several other PR's get claimed/flipped, we're probably playing in a 2:10 setup, which will turn this into a game of process of elimination rather than trying to catch scum via association. <br><br>I'm tempted to do a little bandwagon analysis, given the makeup of the final D1 wagon is quite unusual:<br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote Count</span><br><br><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Starbuckles</span></span> (7) - <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">BT</span></span>, Scumhunter, McStab, Ranmaru, Carbondioxide, <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Dunhumganger</span></span>, Cartographer<br>Scumhunter (1) - scooby<br>Ranmaru (1) - <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Hoopla</span></span><br><br>Not Voting (3) - Elias_the_thief, <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Starbuckles</span></span>, KingdomAces</fieldset><br><br>From my perspective, McStab is quite likely to be a 1-Shot Tracker. I think unless he was dealt this role as scum and trueclaimed, he'd fakeclaim something with more upside to keeping him alive, like a full Tracker perhaps. Given the nature of the setup, if he really is a 1-Shot Tracker, then it is likelier he is on the town's side as it seems somewhat pointless to give this role to scum when there is likely going to be little town power to track. <br><br>This should make it reasonably likely that Scumhunter is town too, as such an investigation would catch Scumhunter ~50% of the time. Admittedly, scum would likely kill with their towniest looking player, which Scumhunter probably wouldn't have been, as a few people thought he was suspect yesterday, which slightly reduces the value of this investigation, but I believe it still has merit, and to even consider lynching Scumhunter we ought to <span style=\"font-style: italic\">very</span> suspicious of him - I'm not going to lynch Scumhunter on a mild scum read, when we have a result half-clearing him.<br><br>It also begs the question: if McStab is town, why did scum opt to leave him alive, particularly when they (presumably) don't have a Roleblocker? Doc-fear and the fact the PR expires after N1 might be an answer. They could have believed that they had a townie enough looking player to evade the track. They also could have believed that McStab's claim was still seen as sketchy and could be used as mislynch fodder deeper in the game if left alive. Regardless, I think there are enough reasons to keep him alive that it shouldn't detract from his claim being likely town. I don't expect everyone to fully agree with me here, given I'm basing this on setup speculation more so than anything else, but I'm moderately confident in this read, and subsequently Scumhunter's innocence.<br><br>Following on from this, this is how I see the lynch wagon with that information factored in:<br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote Count</span><br><br><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Starbuckles</span></span> (7) - <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">BT</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Scumhunter, McStab</span></span>, Ranmaru, Carbondioxide, <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Dunhumganger</span></span>, Cartographer<br><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Scumhunter</span></span> (1) - scooby<br>Ranmaru (1) - <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Hoopla</span></span><br><br>Not Voting (3) - Elias_the_thief, <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Starbuckles</span></span>, KingdomAces</fieldset><br><br>For me, I find it weird that all my town reads and prob-townies based on PoE are all on the Starbuckle wagon. It wouldn't surprise me if any of Ranmaru, CO2 or Cartographer are scum, but I think it's a trap to read too deeply into this snapshot alone. The thing I find with trying to pick out scum on a wagon, is that it's highly dependent on how much pressure scum under during the day;<br><br>If no scum has been wagoned or is looking like a likely candidate throughout the day, scum have little to no incentive to push through a lynch on a townie - all this achieves is blood on their own hands, when a townie could have been lynched without them anyway, giving them an easy high ground to cast potshots at L-1, hammer votes, or the wagon in general.<br><br>If scum has come under pressure at some point, and especially if competing wagons between two or three players features one scum, you tend to get a higher ratio of scum on the townie's wagons due to perceived pressure. This usually triggers scum to commit to a bus or push the town wagon harder. <br><br>The (likely) lower ratio of scum in this game initially made me hesitant to do some bandwagon analysis, as scum have less influence on wagons overall (and I don't often do wagon analysis as early as D2), but because we have a lot of likely townies all appearing on one wagon, I think this is enough flips/likely flips to eke out some conclusions. Here is what I think:<br><br>The collapse of the McStab wagon as we were approaching deadline gave us some interesting information. We were in limbo, with as many as five possible people who could have been lynched. Here is how the votes stood:<br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote Count</span><br><br>Cartographer (2) - KingdomAces, <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">McStab</span></span><br><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Scumhunter </span></span>(2) - scooby, Cartographer<br><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Starbuckles</span></span> (2) - <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">BT</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Scumhunter</span></span><br>Ranmaru (2) - <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Hoopla, Dunhamganger</span></span><br><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Hoopla </span></span>(1) - Carbondioxide<br><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">McStab</span></span> (1) - Ranmaru<br><br>Not Voting (2) - Elias_the_thief, Starbuckles</fieldset><br><br>Other than McStab, any of those players could have been lynched, including myself. From my perspective, most of the options would have resulted in a town mislynch. After a brief lull, McStab broke the deadlock and voted Starbuckles, which was immediately followed by Ranmaru shifting onto the wagon with little other reasoning than it nearing deadline. This could merely be self-preservation as either alignment, but it's mildly scummy, as scum-Ranmaru has much more to lose in this situation than town-Ranmaru.<br><br>CO2 jumps on the Starbuckles wagon immediately after Ranmaru citing the same slip as everyone else. If anything, I find this vote to be likelier town than Ranmaru's, purely because Starbuckles' wagon was essentially locked in at this stage (or very close to it), so there was no need to jump on the wagon - the only reason to as scum would be to indirectly protect against another wagon collecting votes (his own or his buddy). Given CO2 had no votes, and every other competing wagon except Ranmaru/Cartographer was scum, CO2 would have to be scum with either of those players - and I don't see him being scum with Ranmaru, immediately following him onto a mislynch using the same \"slip\" reasoning as him - it's too obvious, and new players tend to subconsciously steer clear of that. I don't really think CO2 is scum because of this, and if we are to lynch from the wagon it should be Ranmaru or Cartographer.<br><br>Now, onto Cartographer. He was particularly active around deadline and was proactive with hammering Starbuckles, which I always interpret as town behaviour. Since replacing into Demon Core's slot, he was been pretty proactive in general which is a positive sign, but I also get a gut read that Demon Core was town based on how that wagon collapsed - it was largely due to natural causes, without any obvious indirect pushes occurring on other wagons. The only defenses Demon Core got were obvious ones, with scooby and Dunham both saying Demon Core was obv-town. I find that if scooby is scum, he's much likelier to say such a thing about a townie than his (only) buddy. If both defenders are town, then the defenses don't matter, and means the wagon wasn't being defended by scum.<br><br>I find the lack of \"pushing\" during the crucial deadlock (where five candidates existed), implies that there is at most one scum there. If Cartographer/Ranmaru was scum, I'd expect more aggression when the McStab wagon was nearing its close, and when it collapsed. The game being quiet when there are two possible scum that could be suddenly flash-wagoned makes no sense, which is why I rule out Ranmaru/Cartographer as a team also. At most, I see one scum in Ranmaru/CO2/Cartographer, with mild town reads on the last two. If any on the Starbuckles wagon is scum, it is likely to be Ranmaru, in my opinion.<br><br>We also need to consider which player(s) off the wagon make sense as scum too. Of scooby/Elias/Kingdom, I'm inclined towards scooby, solely on the basis that Elias/Kingdom make less sense as a scumpartner for Ranmaru, but I'll make a separate analysis post on those three independent of Ranmaru's alignment. <br><br>For the time being, I'd like to vote Ranmaru:<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Ranmaru</span>"}

I don't know why you keep clinging on to the replacement tell. I'll take it as null because I never know why people really replace out.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">2</span>. Underlined, I see the possiblity of Mcstab faking the claim. I also see it as closer to vanilla, and his actions at night don't actually line up with a town mindset to me. His track doesn't really give any info to the town. You are really giving Mcstab's play leniency only due to his claim and I find you really aren't trying to find scum because of that. In fact, now that he used up his shot, he is now semi-clear as Scumhunter is, and I believe is still an option. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">3</span>. Not going into that. Waste of time to think of it due to night kill wifom, and I feel you are bringing this up to cover why Mcstab may still be town while not being killed over night. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">4</span>. You state that most of your town reads and town poe reads are on the wagon, but it had to be this way because to get a lynch you'd need majority, and of course it'll include more than scum numbers, meaning there has to be town on it. I find this statement odd because it seems you are trying to say this to paint your left over reads as possible scum reads. Think of it like this \"I find it weird my town reads are on this wagon and not Ranmaru/CO2/Cartographer, even though there has to be town on a wagon for there to be a majority in the first place\". See? It seems redundant, and I don't see any legit reason for you to say that.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">5</span>. Underlined, I feel you contributed to the crash of the Mcstab wagon. Here is something you forgot to mention: In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4324964#p4324964\" class=\"postlink\">Post #88</a> you vote Mcstab, with an eye roll smiley.

I feel this was because you were 'on his wagon' yet when it built up, you got off for a weak reason, because you didn't have enough town reads on it. I would also like to mention that you also <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4314836#p4314836\" class=\"postlink\">voted CO2</a> early d1, without giving a reason, and I asked you about it and you didn't answer. I find this to be scummy, because I feel CO2 may have been your buddy and you took the early opportunity to vote him when he had pressure going on him, yet once he was called town for being 'confused', you layed off him and I don't recall you ever giving a reason as to why you got off it. It shows you weren't trying to find his alignment there. You also didn't really answer much of my questions, and just conversed with others. This shows you are being one sided with your scumread on me, and aren't really trying to find my alignment.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">6</span>. Underlined, I was in no way voting for survival. I was not going to be lynched, so I don't see why you see it like that. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">7</span>. Underlined, you start to narrow down the 'not town reads', and show that CO2's vote is townier than me. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">8</span>. You narrow it down further, and to me. I find this convenient for you (as scum), in that you don't really vote me for suspicious reasons, but only because you narrowed it down from a batch of your town reads, because you had weak reasons to suspect me in the first place. I just find it odd that you try to PoE a wagon, instead of looking for scum intent from it.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4363986#p4363986\" class=\"postlink\">post 454</a>, Hoopla wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4363968#p4363968\" class=\"postlink\">post 452</a>, Elias_the_thief wrote:</cite>@Hoopla: Ranmaru isn't even close to scummy in my book.

My posts were elaborating on a question Cartographer had asked me, and that was about my Elias scumread, and once I read back to that I remembered that his earlier posts (his responses to Starbuckles) seemed like distancing, if Starbuckles would have flipped scum. Posting those quotes near deadline would definetly have been helpful if Starbuckles would have flipped scum, because people would surely remember those quotes, and most likely look at Elias with more scrutiny. I find that you didn't even consider this a possibility, a scumtell. Rather I feel you are trying to make it seem like I was trying to over-justify a weak vote, when all the vote was, was just a deadline vote. (When in reality, I was just trying to make sure the town remembered that Elias may have been scum with Starbuckles, which is deff a town mindset, something that I don't think you considered)<br><br>Bold, you make a contradiction here. I'll show you, from your <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4363521#p4363521\" class=\"postlink\">Post #447</a>:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>which was immediately followed by Ranmaru <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">shifting onto the wagon with little other reasoning than it nearing deadline</span></span></span>. <span class=\"noboldsig\">This could merely be self-preservation as either alignment, but it's mildly scummy</span>, as scum-Ranmaru has much more to lose in this situation than town-Ranmaru</div></blockquote><br><br>Here, you state that I was following along with little other reason than deadline. Here is the kicker: You state that it is mildly scummy for me to do so, because it's possible I was doing it for survival, yet when responding to Elias above, you stated that my vote wasn't actually a crime, and still try to connect scumminess to it. So the question is, was my vote near deadline a crime you, or not? Now, in the red, you state that the deadline reasoning would have sufficed, yet in the quote below, you state that my little to no reason vote near deadline, was midly scummy, since it would be me trying to survive. Yet, you didn't include the reasoning about my following posts. So, in conclusion, you were trying to fake your way to the conclusion of me voting for survival, even though you said the reasoning would have sufficed in the first quote. This is inconsistent, and it shows that you are trying to fake reasons to paint me as scum. Still confused? Think of it like this: \"Well, he could have just left it at that, that it was just a deadline vote, because to me, his following posts made it seem like he was trying to survive, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">yet I'd still think of it as a survival vote either way</span>.\" That (Is not something someone would say, but it's the only way I can express to people why it is a suspicious angle to me), is the reason why I find the two different quotes inconsistent, and fake. This solidly earns my vote on you:<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Hoopla</span>"}

I think it makes a lot more sense that he's town and suspects something is up, rather than he's trying to spin this situation into his favour somehow as scum. My view on this is partially influenced by his recent thread in MD - I never really knew anything about Ranmaru, so I was surprised to see how he responded. If I can posit a small side-theory that may be true on some level: I suspect it's possible he may be allured by the prospect of catching out a marquee player (I apparently have a good reputation as scum), which may be why he was of a mindset susceptible to interpreting my post on him as sketchy. <br><br>It just seems really weird that he'd respond to me like that, and I can't see him doing it as scum. I think I probably took a cavalier approach to my interpretation of the deadline play - I made bold assertions about Ranmaru's motivations to which he's provided decent counterpoints.

After that you comment that Hoopla hasn't explained her self vote, and you thought that it was a reaction test, yet even though you clearly went though Hoopla's ISO.

That in itself isn't scummy in that town does this quite frequently (going into a read/ISO with a predetermine bias towards the person's slot) but I do question your intent in doing so. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4342121#p4342121\" class=\"postlink\">post 280</a>, scooby wrote:</cite>Wait, Demon Core is like painfully town, Hoopla what the fuck are yoiu doing</div></blockquote><br><br>Granted you are right about my slot, but how exactly could you come to the conclusion that Demon Core was town when he had so little posts? <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4343089#p4343089\" class=\"postlink\">post 292</a>, McStab wrote:</cite>Well it looks like I need to claim to avoid being lynched, deadline's coming in.<br><br>I'm a one-shot tracker.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4314899#p4314899\" class=\"postlink\">post 21</a>, McStab wrote:</cite>I'm having trouble keeping <span class=\"noboldsig\">track</span> of all these chemistry terms</div></blockquote><br><br>Breadcrumb.<br><br><br>Some doc protection tonight would be nice.</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm innately suspicious of one-shot abilities, especially when they are claimed to prevent a lynch.  The biggest thing that bothers me here is that the request for the doc protect can have scum motive; scum now knows where doc is going to be, so while they might not be able to hit doc that Night they can guarantee that the doc will not block their kill.

Thinking about it, if we are in a 2:10 game, then it's quite likely we have few PR's (1-2 probably, maybe 3 weak ones), that it doesn't make a lot of sense from a design perspective to include a Tracker for scum. Its primary use would be to act as a pseudo-Role Cop, but if most of the town is vanilla, why give it to scum? If the claim is true (which I think it is), I actually think its likelier that it's coming from a town player, as there is more overall value to the role as it can track other town PR's or scum, as opposed to 1 or 2 town PR's.

Unfortunately the time crunch of the deadline makes it harder to tell who hopped on the wagon for legitimate reasons, who did it for a pro-town reason of making sure a lynch went through, and who was scum trying to get a town mislynch.  I remember Scumhunter having a legit reason for getting on the wagon, and Ranmaru and CO2 are strong town reads for me.  The scummiest person on that wagon for me is by far Dunhumganger, and I'm still keeping an eye on McStab.  Scooby, Elias, and KingdomAces, all non-voters, are also places I think are important to look, and of those Elias gives me a vibe of not caring about town and not demonstrating town intent through scum hunting.  Scooby and KingdomAces keep popping in with input but not leaving a strong town intent in my mind; Scooby strikes me as less coherent and I'm slightly more suspicious of him than KingdomAces, who I don't feel has been very active but when he is I find him for the most part rational and presenting an interesting opinion on what is going on in the thread.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4363363#p4363363\" class=\"postlink\">post 430</a>, Scumhunter wrote:</cite>Dunham, what the hell is the logic for voting me?

The only reason why I talked about that was because I was answering Cartographer's question to me, and I happened to remember those quotes. So I gave a possible link in the chance of a Buckle scumflip. I don't see how it would seem I was trying to justify my vote there.

I think I explained why me talking about a possible connection doesn't imply I'm trying to justify a deadline vote.

It's clear he is a thinking player, and I suspect he is at the level when he realises there is a real chance that if he fires back with a case, it could easily degenerate into a mutual tunneling on each other (increasing his own chances of being lynched over a regulation defense), and setting aside modesty, I think I have an image that would deter a player like Ranmaru from doing this so overtly as scum. I think it makes a lot more sense that he's town and suspects something is up, rather than he's trying to spin this situation into his favour somehow as scum. <span class=\"noboldsig\">My view on this is partially influenced by his recent thread in MD - I never really knew anything about Ranmaru, so I was surprised to see how he responded. If I can posit a small side-theory that may be true on some level: I suspect it's possible he may be allured by the prospect of catching out a marquee player (I apparently have a good reputation as scum), which may be why he was of a mindset susceptible to interpreting my post on him as sketchy</span>.</div></blockquote> <br><br>My thread has nothing to do with trying to catch better players than I, but players closer to my level. So I don't see why you saw it like that. My point is, I will put out my reads however I see them, regardless of the person's experience.

Whether I'm lying or not is for others to decide, not me.<br><br>As for \"scum off the wagon\" the way the wagon formed (after others built up and ebbed away) it didn't feel like there was a particular push (which I would have attributed to scum) or indeed any particular bandwagon jumping.  In all it felt a bit like everyone was \"Meh... dunno... this wagon will do.\" for lack of alternatives.  That made me think that scum were pretty happy with letting things take their course, without having to do any pushing or vote switching themselves.<br><br>Lastly, McStabb our '1-shot-tracker-honest' \u2014 I'm leaning towards scummy on him.  The 1-shot thing and choosing, in my opinion, a not-so-great target (scumhunter may have been on my list, but not top of it) it just all seems too convenient.  He's now (as far as PR goes) useless to the Town but supposedly utterly vindicated and 100% Town.  If he's scum you could put a bow on it \u2014 it's just too perfect.<br><br>However, I can understand why he'd use his 1-shotness on night 1... if I had a 1-shot PR I'd be tempted to use it right away (it's kinda like a new toy, yet to be unwrapped, no?) especially as he was made to claim (better unwrap that toy before you die)... so that's what's confusing my slightly-scummy-but-could-be-Town read on him.<br><br>As for my vote on Dunham, it was meant to pressure him into bringing more to the table for the Town.  Since my vote he has posted once... with nine words (oh and a rolly-eye face).  It's this kinda insightful, helpful contribution that almost makes me want to lynch him whether he's Town or not!"}

Do you still believe there was scum on the wagon, and if so, who do you believe that is now?</div></blockquote><br><br>I'll answer this since it's relevant to what's happening now. <br><br>I think there might still be scum on the wagon, but I think your rebuttal of my interpretation of your vote was fair, which was a key component in how I was reading the deadline play. If you're town, then it's highly likely no scum was under pressure at all during the deadline (and prior to it), which makes the base of the lynch wagon and off it completely suspicious, as players in tilt votes and actually forwarding the game tend not to scum. <br><br>To give an example of this, in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3609365#p3609365\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1272</a>, there were competing wagons on townies all day, with scum under zero pressure. This produced this set of votes:<br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Lady Lambdadelta</span></span> (7) - <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">implosion, Scumhunter, Katsuki, Hoopla, Amrun, Samuel L Jackson, Fate</span></span><br><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Katsuki </span></span>(4) - <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">redtail896</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Juls, Lady Lambdadelta</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Mist Beauty</span></span><br><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">implosion</span></span> (1) - <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">PeregrineV</span></span><br><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">redtail896</span></span> (1) - <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Quilford</span></span><br><br>Not Voting (0)</fieldset><br><br>You'll note zero scum being on the wagon, and with redtail and Peregrine, they sat on their votes the majority of the day - they had no real reason to jump on the LLD wagon or make big statements about anything in general. However, if Katsuki was scum, it is much more likely we would have seen LLD's wagon feature one or two scum in the middle of the wagon powering it ahead before katsuki's wagon can be a threat OR later on the LLD wagon if Katsuki's wagon is stronger (once a certain tipping point reaches, it opens up bussing decisions for scum too). <br><br>But since scum were under zero pressure, they don't move votes or make controversial moves. It's much easier to maintain the status quo. This is why you see scum in early positions on the lynch wagon OR not on the lynch wagon at all when there is no pressure. You can see the votecount of this game paints that picture. I've collected data, skimmed, read or played in hundreds of games and have seen this general pattern occur over and over again. Lack of pressure equals lack of risks taken, and you can generally deduce the risk of a vote by position or context in a game.<br><br>To apply this logic to the game we're playing now: If you're town, then it's highly likely scum were under little to no pressure throughout the majority of D1, which means we should expect players off the wagon or at the base of the lynch wagon (away from the riskier/more proactive votes). So, looking at our D1 wagon:<br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote Count</span><br><br><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Starbuckles</span></span> (7) - <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">BT</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Scumhunter, McStab</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Ranmaru</span></span>, Carbondioxide, <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Dunhumganger</span></span>, Cartographer<br><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Scumhunter</span></span> (1) - scooby<br>Ranmaru (1) - <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Hoopla</span></span><br><br>Not Voting (3) - Elias_the_thief, <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Starbuckles</span></span>, KingdomAces</fieldset><br><br>You can see the base of Starbuckles wagon is largely town, so we realistically should be looking at those OFF the wagon. The reason why I was going after you (Ranmaru) earlier was because you being scum makes sense from the perspective of why that vote is being made. If your wagon was a viable option around deadline (something I believed), your vote on Starbuckles isn't a risky/proactive vote - it's one of self-preservation. I've since come to believe your wagon wasn't as much of an option as I remembered, which is why I'm eliminating self-preservation as your primary motivation, which gives your vote more credibility. <br><br>It's possible we have a zero scum lynch wagon if you are in fact town, which if true, incriminates Elias/Kingdom/scooby and me (from a neutral perspective). At the moment, I'm voting Kingdom on gut from that pool, because I trust scooby right now, and haven't decided on Elias yet."}

That doesn't mean I accept that his claim is legit, but I don't think the way he used his pr shows inherently scummy intent.  <br><br>Agreed on the fact that CO2 didn't look at himself when analyzing wagons is a null tell; it's not necessary to state your own alignment because you know your own alignment (or if you are scum what your alignment is supposed to be).<br><br>Your points about CO2 not analyzing everyone on the wagon and only looking at Scooby and Hoopla are good in drawing attention to his oversight, but once again I feel like you are stretching this point to far to find it scummy.  I think he should provide his analysis on Hoopla and Scooby but I don't think his overlooking them shows scum intent, it seems to me that he had a predisposition and already developed suspicion of Elias and Kingdom which made him look at them first and focus on them.  <br><br>Your points back and forth with Hoopla are honestly hard for me to read through and pay attention.  I agree that by no means does replacing out make Robb/Durham town, and that writing him off as town for that is a bad move.  I think that 1-shot tracker isn't impossible for him to have but that it is suspect; a large part of me thinks that the claim was motivated by self-preservation and that it could really be a fake claim.  McStab's play overall however has only raised a few red flags for me and I'd prefer a Durham lynch toDay.  Hoopla's point about being suspicious that all her PoE town reads and prob-town reads makes sense to me in that a D1 wagon almost always has scum on it somewhere, so being cautious in analyzing the wagon is good, although I think it shouldn't be a driving factor in finding someone scummy, although she seems to have avoided doing that anyways.  Points 5 and 6 away from McStab and onto Starbuckles seem overly cautious to me, and the assertion that it could have been self-preservation just doesn't seem to adequately describe the situation.  There were not only multiple wagons, there was no clear consensus on where to go and there was a rapidly approaching deadline.  I think McStab taking control of the situation and leading an end-of-the-Day wagon onto Starbuckles and then the following of people over to that wagon is typical in a crunch situation where one lynch is not the clear choice.  I find some of Hoopla's logic exactly counter to my own, such as that someone who is extremely active and helping hammer around the deadline being more likely town, I've seen it a lot from scum as well in order to achieve a mislynch so I don't like Hoopla's criteria for analyzing the wagon.  This seems like a difference in playstyle rather than scum intent or false scumhunting to me though.  <br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4376747#p4376747\" class=\"postlink\">post 507</a>, Ranmaru wrote:</cite>Talk to me about CO2 possibly being scum.

I agree that by no means does replacing out make Robb/Durham town, and that writing him off as town for that is a bad move.

I find some of Hoopla's logic exactly counter to my own, such as that someone who is extremely active and helping hammer around the deadline being more likely town, I've seen it a lot from scum as well in order to achieve a mislynch so I don't like Hoopla's criteria for analyzing the wagon. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">This seems like a difference in playstyle rather than scum intent or false scumhunting to me though</span>.</div></blockquote> <br> <br>Bold, I respect you pushing for Dumhammer, yet I want to know, do you think it may also be part of his playstyle? How does this compare to your statement in the underlined?<br><br><span style=\"color: #FF40BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">It feels different between Hoopla and Durham; Hoopla's playstyle is succinct and minimalist in a lot of ways but she still seems to be trying to provide content and analyzing instead of just providing information.  My issues with Durham aren't with his playstyle, it's with robb's scummy, opportunistic  use of \"tells\" to justify all his reads and then Durham showing a lack of interest in scumhunting until recently, which was only when he became a target for lynch.</span></span><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I don't find CO2 scummy, I think he's been demonstrating town intent in his posts.

Is that anti-town? Of course, but it doesn't mean she was scummy.  In terms of the bolded, that's mostly just a vibe that when she's doing these wagon analyses and trying to break down the set-up, she's doing it with genuine town intent.  I get that feeling because she's not doing IIoA, she's actually analyzing the information as well and using it to help define her scumpicks.</span></span><br><br>Underlined, how exactly does 'over-reaction' mean scum intent?

A mafia tracker would be about as useful as a rolecop, since it tells who is a PR as well as who they are targeting with said PR, even if they don't know exactly what role it is. Scumhunter seemed to be softclaiming a lot D1, so he would be the natural scum information role target, who also just happens to have been a natural town information role target as well.<br><br>In terms of setup, would really just one doctor be enough to justify starting off on evens?

He came to my defense at a time when I was taking a lot of heat at the beginning of the day yesterday...I didn't think it would make much sense for him to come to my defense there if he were scum. It would be much easier to just bandwagon the suspicions on me, no? Also I found it odd the way Hoopla reasoned \"McStab is probably a 1-shot tracker regardless of alignment\" yesterday. Didn't really follow the logic there, and I think Hoopla-scum knowing that McStab is in-fact a 1-shot tracker giving his real result pointed it out as a way to look helpful in thread?? Idk. I kind of wrote McStab off because I didn't think scum would defend me at that point in the game. I guess McStab was also under a lot of heat and I fully believe that he did track me night 1. I kind of soft claimed like I was a power role on day 1 when there was some pressure on me which made me a logical check for the scum, and it kind of worked out because ya know, I was tracked instead of someone with a role with more utility than just a VT.<br><br>Going to think over the game. Also, apologize for large batches of inactivity yesterday was busy IRL and pretty much site flaking in general and I'm planning on taking a break after this game, but will be doing my very best to keep up.<br><br>Yeap. I could see Hoopla-scum or scooby-scum, would need to relook over CO2. McStab flipping scum kind of shakes up my view on the game so going to pretty much have to go back to the drawing board for the remaining scum, but we lynched scum at least, that's always good."}

Something that did cross my mind is that the result McStab got may not necessarily have been \"stayed in\"... perhaps in some sort of cloak and dagger, nudge-nudge, \"I know you're a PR\" way did McStab out Scumhunter as Town, thereby 'saving' a Town PR, to make himself look even more Town in SH's eyes.

That immediately connected the two player slots in a way that after McStab's flip looks a lot like distancing.

While the number of scum isn't actually random, with the information available to us at the present time it could be either, and with no reason why it could be one over the other it could be treated as random. If Hoopla and Scooby/Snake are about equally as scummy, and there is a pseudo-random element which would cause Hoopla not to be scum without such an element for Scooby/Snake, then probability-wise, Hoopla would be less likely to be scum.

Sorry for the misunderstanding. I do want to ask why you didn't just say \"It doesn't make sense from a scum perspective, as I have explained here: [link]\". I am not fine with leaving Hoopla in endgame, especially if you find her hard to read. You are saying \"If there are two, then we can leave her, but if there are three, then we should look at her\", yet there isn't any way to know which of the two are true. So it's a bit of a reach and wishful thinking in your end. Basically, you are saying you feel it's useless to push on her because her playstyle seems like it is null, but there is always intent in how a player plays. I feel she has strong connections to Mcstab, so I don't see how her playstyle always being null just makes her not scum, even though she has connections to him, and him to her. <br><br>Kingdom, I also want you to really re-evaluate your read on Dumham. Today, we are lynching Hoopla. You say that you want to keep her to end-game since you'll have more information to look at, but here is the thing. We already have enough information to catch scum. You are saying you don't find Dumham scum because he is being anti-town, but you have to erase the mindset that people being anti-town = not scum. Scum can be anti-town. You also have to look at the intent in Dumham's posts, and not just the surface [Them being anti-town]. I also do want you to talk to me about your Snake read. I want you to talk about what options you will want to go through tommorow. Give me a concise reason as to why you feel Snake is most likely scum.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Carbon Dioxide</span>: <br><br>You make a good point on the smiley just being \"Fine I'll unvote myself\". Yet, she did vote Mcstab for some unknown reason. I felt she might have voted him due to something Valiray said. Yet she never explained her reasoning, so I can't know for sure. I just don't know what else is relevant to both the timing of her vote, and the place. So that is why I assume Vali's response has something to do with it (and Mcstab not responding to it at all).<br><br>I feel Scooby wouldn't be attacking Scumhunter that hard if Scooby was scum. Do you think Scooby may have been hardbussing Scumhunter? Scooby was active D1, less so on D2. He didn't have alot of content, he was more of a one liner.<br><br>Simple. The intent is different. Hoopla was trying to clear Mcstab, yet succumbed to voting him at the end of day while expressing it was dumb. What was the intent here? To have some towncred. (Hoopla nor Dumham get town points for being so late on the wagon) Now look at Scumhunter. He was being very stubborn with his read on Mcstab, and was wtf frustrated at the hammer on Mcstab. It shows that his read on Mcstab wasn't faked. Rather, he believed that Mcstab was town, so I find it slightly townie that he was going wtf at him being hammered. It's not simply \"She called scum town, so that's why she is scum\". It's more than that. You have to look at WHY she called him town.<br><br>Yes, most likely. Also consider Kingdom was the counter wagon to Mcstab. (And Hoopla was also for the Kingdom wagon) He is defending Hoopla but I am giving him the benefit of the doubt here, I just believe he truly believes Hoopla has been playing like her other game so to him, and that we are wasting our time in his pov (which I strongly disagree with). Now back to KA being a counter wagon, do you think scum would try to lynch another scumbuddy over McstabSCUM? I think not. <br><br>Yes, Mcstab voted Dumham on D2. He voted him three times, but you can't just judge the connections by how many times a scum voted someone. Like I said, you have to look at WHY they voted that person, and why they voted them that many times. You also have to see at what the person says WITHOUT a vote. Had Mcstab ever mentioned Robb? Nope. He only starts to mention Dumham (in a suspecting way) here: <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4363236#p4363236\" class=\"postlink\">Post #423</a>  Now then. This post seemed like OMGUS towards Dumham. I feel the reason why Mcstab voted Dumham was because he saw something scummy from a scum member, and took advantage of that to bus him. Yet this is only a possibility, and we can't know for sure what Mcstab's real motives were for voting Dumham, but it's ok. We can figure out what they may have been trying to do, by also looking at how Dumham/Robbnva treated Mcstab. I will show it in the next post."}

I also am wondering why he wanted to claim after me yet said he protected me last night.</div></blockquote><br><br>Why This Is Scummy:<br><br>1. <blockquote><div><cite>Ranmaru wrote:</cite>I agree that Dumham should go after (or before) Snake. Elias should go right after those three. Yet I still don't believe we should mass claim today. If the rest of the town believes we should, I would like for you guys to present why you think it would benefit us (besides Hoopla/Dumham). I feel Snake is the least towniest of my reads, which is why I'm fine with him claiming third or second. Why is he the least? Only because of him not actually saying as much as he has in other games. I want everyone to keep that in mind as well. He shouldn't be kept off the suspect list for this reason. So it would be Hoopla &gt; Dumham &gt; Snake. </div></blockquote><br><br>Says he doesn't want to massclaim, but then fixes the order for everyone. Implies - but never actually states - that he will play along if everyone claims.<br><br>2. If Ran really believes my claim is fake, why does he want to wait until tomorrow to lynch me? Tries to sow additional seeds of doubt as to why I wanted him to claim before when, when it's obvious that if the set-up is 10:2 Doc/Nurse vs. 1-shot Tracker, there's no reason for me to claim my actual role, and so me going last is the best possible thing."}

While there is a chance in this case that scum picks the cop correctly and Dunham doesn't, The WIFOM with the nurse on top of only a 33% chance of actually hitting the cop would probably make the cop survive the night and there would be little scum PR's could do about it.<br><br>Or I'm completely wrong and it would be better to just finish the massclaim.

I'm more inclined to rule people out when possible, so lets see what we can find...<br><br>Of the D1 wagon on McStab, it reached two separate peaks, firstly:<br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">McStab</span></span> (5) - <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Starbuckles</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Hoopla</span></span>, Elias_the_Thief, Ranmaru, <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">BT</span></span><br>Scumhunter (3) - scooby, <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Demon Core</span></span>, Dunhamganger<br><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Demon Core</span></span> (2) - KingdomAces, Scumhunter<br><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Hoopla</span></span> (1) - <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">McStab</span></span><br>scooby (1) - Carbondioxide</fieldset><br><br>and then here, when I bailed:<br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">McStab</span></span> (5) - <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Starbuckles</span></span>, Elias_the_thief, Ranmaru, <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">BT</span></span>, Carbondioxide<br><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Demon Core</span></span> (3) - KingdomAces, Scumhunter, <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">McStab</span></span><br>Scumhunter (2) - scooby, <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Demon Core</span></span><br>Ranmaru (2) - <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Hoopla</span></span>, Dunhamganger</fieldset><br><br>On the first wagon, when <span class=\"noboldsig\">Elias</span> voted, he was actually fourth on McStab's wagon (as Carbon was still on McStab for a pressure vote of some kind) - so his vote holds a decent amount of weight - as does <span class=\"noboldsig\">Ranmaru</span>'s when he joined. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Ranmaru</span>'s vote was actually his first in the game upon replacing into his slot - that seems like quite an aggressive bus, when he didn't really himself many outs off the wagon. I think both of these players deserve a decent amount of credit for their positions on this wagon, as this is really one foot in the grave if this is only a two person scumteam. Bussing a sole buddy is a very different proposition to a 3-player scumteam, where bussing/distancing is commonplace.<br><br>The relative importance of your buddy's survival is such that you can't afford to link too dramatically with them, however, as such I am not expecting many or any defense's of McStab to come from scum. It's too risky - I'd expect scum to push others' harder when McStab was under pressure, stay quiet when McStab was under pressure or bus lightly and/or when necessary. I think it's moderately safe to consider <span class=\"noboldsig\">Elias</span> and <span class=\"noboldsig\">Ranmaru</span> longshots as both were involved on the D1 and D2 wagons of McStab - but particularly <span class=\"noboldsig\">Ranmaru</span> who has been more influential. It would be an exceptional bus if one of them is scum.<br><br>Unless this massclaim seriously gets shaken up here with the last people to claim, <span class=\"noboldsig\">Dunham</span> is all but confirmed town in my eyes. Coupled with the obv-town replace-out by Robb, we're not lynching a Nurse - scum will likely kill him tonight, which has great benefit to the town, so even if Ranmaru is still suspicious of Dunham, the percentage-play is to let Dunham soak up the NK if he's town, and then lynch him deeper in the game if he really is scum (he'll be NK'ed though, so we won't even need to cross that bridge).<br><br>I'm also inclined to believe <span class=\"noboldsig\">Scumhunter </span>is town, as this would be an exceedingly aggressive double-fluff to nominate your partner as the player you tracked.  In the end, McStab did get lynched, but he was a decent chance to survive D2. Why claim an inno on your buddy when neither you or your partner are under any real pressure? It's far more likely scum are trying to use it for a cheap wifom link to with a townie once McStab is dead, imo.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Carbondioxide</span>'s vote on McStab late on D1 is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">really</span> good - you can see that vote represented in the second vote count I quoted. At the time, deadline was nearing and people were starting to jump ship onto Demon Core - two people had just switched to Demon Core and it was 4-4 between Demon and McStab. That is an exception bus if Carbon is scum with McStab, as an easy option had just presented itself - why wouldn't you take it if McStab, your only buddy, could avoid the lynch without fuss. I honestly don't see Carbon making this play as scum.<br><br>~~<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Scooby/SnakePlissken</span> and <span class=\"noboldsig\">Kingdom</span> are the only two players that really make any sense from the way the D1 wagons went down. Both were voting someone else around the time deadline was approaching, and while McStab was on five votes. Scooby, himself, was aggressively campaigning for Scumhunter's death which is exactly the sort of response I expect from scum in that situation - an indirect defense by trying to prop up another target.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Kingdom</span> did play a more active role in getting McStab lynched on D2 despite going missing when McStab was under pressure on D1, but you also need to remember, Kingdom himself was under pressure during D2, so a double bus in this instance is usually a decent play (or at least the best time to make a double bus). It's probably not as likely as the <span class=\"noboldsig\">scooby/Snake</span> slot being scum, but I really only see either of these two players being scum.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: SnakePlissken</span>"}

You could have allowed it to make it easier to defend McStab while he was alive and/or so you could bring this point up later on.

From what I've read on the site there are some players who only contribute through such means, regardless of alignment. As a counter-example, scroll a few posts down from that one, to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4378187#p4378187\">513</a>. Those two posts are just as useless and pointlessly demeaning as each other. While I can't say that is not a reason why I first started looking at Scooby, that isn't one of the reasons I currently think that he's scum.<br><br>When he said he reflected, he discounted the possibility that McStab was a Mafia 1-shot tracker far too easily for someone who would know that he actually was that. The post seemed to come from a preconceived notion that Scumhunter was scum, so he didn't think too hard when he thought of the alternative. <br><br>If anyone forced a connection between me and Hoopla at that point it was me. All he did was point out a part of my argument that I hadn't elaborated on fully. (And insult my intelligence, but that probably only matters to me.) What do you think of this point now?<br><br>I actually agreed with Robbnva in that post, McStab had provided more content than other people and it was weird that Starbuckles had decided to tunnel McStab for no apparent reason. The rest of the post where Dunham told people to stop voting McStab was about how he thought that there were scummier people who were more worthy of being lynched at the time. Have you never defended someone who turned out to be scum?<br><br><br>I know that I am incredibly new to setup speculation, but this is still going back to what I said earlier about starting at 12p instead of 13p. Adding a player to an 11p to make a game a 12p actually decreases the town's chances, so unless either town is able to direct the kill that makes the game go to odds again or there are enough protective roles where there is a decent chance of a protect succeeding, the game would almost definitely have started at 11 or 13 players. One doctor does not give that, but with the addition of a nurse then it becomes more plausible. Now if a 9p with 2 goons and one doctor is balanced, how is adding an additional scum while giving scum two additional kills to towns one lynch, while giving scum a chance to find the doctor balanced at all?"}

Yes, if you flip Cop it ain't looking good for Dunham but we lynch him whilst losing another Townie, which leaves 1 scum v 4 Townies.  1 v 6 is better odds for a Town win."}

Thinking about it, if we are in a 2:10 game, then it's quite likely we have few PR's (1-2 probably, maybe 3 weak ones), that it doesn't make a lot of sense from a design perspective to include a Tracker for scum. Its primary use would be to act as a pseudo-Role Cop, but if most of the town is vanilla, why give it to scum? If the claim is true (which I think it is), I actually think its likelier that it's coming from a town player, as there is more overall value to the role as it can track other town PR's or scum, as opposed to 1 or 2 town PR's. I don't know why I hadn't thought of this before, but yeah, the Tracker is probably town.</div></blockquote>It was wrong, but it's not like it was illogical to think at the time. Hoopla is well known specifically for setup balancing and statistics, so as long as her speculation made some amount of sense it would be greatly considered. What benefit does it give the scum for town to be thinking that there is two scum in the game if there is in fact two scum?<br><br>Ranmaru,<br><br>1. How was that post by Dunhamganger any different than the one by Scooby a few posts down?<br>3. Um, who do you think is scum again? This is only valid from your perspective if you think I'm town, but seeing as your vote is on me that doesn't seem to be the case. We can argue setup speculation all we want, but no one is going to have a suitable case for four groupscum in a 12p game.<br>4. I specifically remember checking McStab's activity around the site at that time, and it wasn't nearly as high as Starbuckles was making it out to be, so yes I do find it weird. I don't think defending the same scum as your predecessor is necessarily scummy if both people have a reason to do so. <br>#2 is is definitely your best point. I will consider this further, but with other things such as his defense on me when it wouldn't make sense for scum to and his claim, I don't think it's strong enough to overcome my town read on him.<br><br>Assuming no no-lynches or no-kills, a 9p is going to have three lynches and three kills before 3p LyLo. A 12p has four lynches and four kills before a 4p MyLo, where the best play is to no-lynch, therefore giving scum a second extra kill to town's extra one lynch.<br><br>I think the \"us\" was opposite of forced, there is no reason why he should have been using himself in relation to Snake in that post. It more looks like an accident that he didn't catch. Snake said that McStab intentionally said that to implicate him after McStab's lynch, but I don't think he would go out of his way to add WIFOM that almost no one would notice."}

On night one I wanted to kill the one person in the town who was being an incredibly obvious townie, but my partner wanted to kill someone who I personally had a real scumread on even though I knew for a fact he wasn't scum. What was their reasoning for wanting this? Because it would place suspicion on the person who he suspected, who was not actually one of us. Reading through games, this reason for killing is cited incredibly often. In this specific case July was not an obvious townie at all, so her position on Dunham had to be at least some part of the reason for her death. Yes, it is WIFOM, but from a Dunhamscum point of view July was not the only person calling for his lynch, and if he wanted to kill someone who wanted him dead, then he would have picked someone who would have been harder to lynch down the line.<br><br>I would also like to point out that you never responded to anything in my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4436405#p4436405\">822</a>.<br><br>There are times when the setup is weirder than you think, and then there are games designed by someone who is known to dislike setups that are weirder than you think.

This is in a queue where incredibly weird roles are expected, so why do you think that there would be any sort of weirdness in a mini normal? Dunham's claim isn't the only reason why I think he's town, but it does pretty much make him confirmed."}

I read the entirety of 817 as defending your case on Dunham, since that is what most of the post was about. In that case, the only points you bring up regarding why Dunham is scum in point 3 are directly dependent on Hoopla being scum, so I assumed you were saying that you still thought Hoopla was scum. If what you were actually questioning in point 3 of 817 was my motivations, then the point does make a lot more sense.

The way she said it it sounds like she was trying to direct the mafia kill. Hoopla being a traitor would also resolve the scumreads people had on Hoopla with the fact that she is definitely not the second member of a scumteam. Also I think that a traitor is sometimes considered balance wise to to be about half of a full scum member, so if the setup was too townsided as a 10:2 as Ranmaru believes but too scumsided as a 9:3 which should be readily apparent, a traitor would balance both scenarios. <br><br>Dispute this, I don't think that this is necessarily the case.

This was just something that I thought might be possible overnight and I thought that I might as well state my entire opinion on the gamestate right now, which included that possibility.<br><br>Scumhunter, mentioning a traitor might be scummy on day one for those reasons, but at this point if a traitor exists the best strategy would be to get the town  to believe that there was only one scum remaining so they would be more loose with votes and surprise quickhammer to end the game. They would have no need to call out to the scum in this instance, and less groupscum than expected would know that there is less of them than expected by now.<br><br>Carbon, Dunham clearly wanted to lynch Hoopla in that post. I believed that Hoopla would flip town, and if Dunhamscum purposely forged a bond between Hoopla and me, then town wouldn't actually have less incentive to lynch me, not more. That's why I saw no scum motivation in that post by Dunham, which is what I was attempting to explain with that, since Dunham's alignment at this point is not worth arguing."}

The main point about her being a traitor was meant as, \"if she is scum, than this is the only possible way she could be.\" What turned that into a general townread was mostly people saying how unlikely a traitor was, as well as actually thinking about it more myself.<br><br>I would like to point out again that your points in 817 were:<br>1.

In addition to that, I don't think I was playing that differently in this game than I was in that one, since I was trying to play to what I thought my town self would do in each specific instance. However, the fact that he didn't actually finish reading that game after he replaced out, and therefore didn't actually know I was scum, makes that point null. Why are you bringing that of all things up at this point?<br><br>Carbon, it would still be 2:2 town:scum ratio, and therefore game over regardless of how many votes are required to lynch.

Traitors are a bit complex, and since the rest of the scumteam doesn't know their identity it takes away from being able to scumhunt properly, which Llama regularly argues is the most important part of mafia.

Post 262/263. I think the reasons Hoopla gives to jump off the wagon are quite frankly bullshit, and overexplained. He acknowledges his reasoning for leaving the wagon is a bit premature, but jumps off regardless because he found it likely that scum was pushing the wagon. He also cites the unlikelihood of scum bussing day 1 to support his point, but doesn't acknowledge the much more realistic possibility of distancing. It seems odd to me that a player who pays pretty close attention to detail would completely ignore this scenario. In 263, as if realizing the faults of 262, continues to back up his vote change by comparing his wagon's progress to McStab's. But the wagon's were for completely different reasons, and its not a fair comparison in the least. I don't think Hoopla could miss that obvious truth unless he did so intentionally. Additionally, saying that McStab's wagon had plateau'd was pretty false; McStab had to claim to prevent his lynch. <br><br>2. His inactivity, especially around deadlines. I think that 447 is an attempt to redeem himself as a productive member of the town, but I'm not convinced. It is mostly setup speculation and wagon analysis, which is in my experience the easiest type of contribution to safely make as scum.  Its also of note that he promises analysis of myself and two other players and never makes that analysis. This reinforces my belief that he was contributing in appearance only and didn't really care about finding scum all that much. <br><br>3. 492 seems contrived. \"Your vote, like you say, is little more than a deadline vote - the fact you talked about her after you placed a vote doesn't change that and sort of waters down your contradiction, which seems to be the catalyst for your suspicion of me. My post was created over the course of a couple of hours, without any real overarching plans when I started writing - I'd be surprised if I didn't make some logical errors or contradictions at some point.\" This once again makes me believe that Hoopla is apathetic to his scumhunting. How can you possibly base a vote off of a post that you expect to contain logical errors and contradictions?<br> <br>4. His attempts to clear McStab based on his claim. I'm not willing to disregard this because he's too experienced to so clearly connect himself. This is a similar line of thinking to his initial decision to clear McStab. You can't assume the level that a player is operating, and I'm not willing to completely disregard this connection because of his experience. It is entirely possible that he didn't expect McStab to be lynched when he was, and made the posts under that assumption. And its not that far-fetched that he would make that connection super clear in order to get the exact response that he has from the town; complete disregard of the connection. I'm not saying that's necessarily the case, but I am saying that too scummy to be scum is a stupid argument and a stupid reason to not lynch Hoopla.<br><br>5. On page 22 Hoopla is asked again to make the analysis he promised. After responding to several points made in the post that ARENT that, Ranmaru reminds him of the point and Hoopla says he's sure he will get to it, but at the same time says it would \"merely be refining within the group of players I'm already settled upon lynching\" but at this point has never clearly stated who he is settled on lynching. He then goes on to say the game doesn't need another wall post but thats a poor excuse. Firstly, thats why god invented spoiler tags, and secondly, this line of thought did not prevent him from making a massive post on the next day that continues to avoid his promised analysis. <br><br>6. McStab hammer is a really bad post. It honestly makes no sense when he had so recently listed him as someone he didn't want to lynch. It seems like a last ditch effort to dismiss his connection with McStab when it became clear that he was the lynch. <br><br>I'll admit its not a fool proof case, and I've never been a stellar scumhunter (my town record is something like 2-8). But I feel that Hoopla's play throughout hasn't been genuine; when he's needed to contribute, he's relied almost solely on setup spec. When he's promised to actually analize players, he danced around the subject and made excuses. And the manner of his McStab hammer makes me really uncomfortable. I don't think the connection is too good to be true. The point about his result on Scumhunter is just not really that great. For one, he was actually a tracker and therefore the safest play for him was to post his actual results. For two, it functions as a pretty convenient cover for the blatant connection between Hoopla-McStab. The fact that Hoopla points to this as a stronger connection than his own strikes me as pretty shifty.</div></div></div>=====================================================================<br><br>Scumhunter, I only mention you in my first post of the day in order to stress how utterly ridiculous the Snake lynch was in the face of much better options. I've had a town read on you and Ranmaru for a while now. I'm not sure who I would put next on my scumlist, were Hoopla to flip town. I'm gonna read again and look more closely at Kingdom and CO2, who I have pretty fuzzy reads on. And of course I'll look at Ranmaru and yourself as well. This is also why I haven't plopped down my vote yet; I thought Hoopla was scum yesterday and I think he's scum today, but now that we're so close to LYLO I want to solidify ALL my reads before I actually commit to a lynch."}

Additionally, I think that coming in that hard out of the gate against McStab is an unlikely scum move, especially since his attacks read genuine to me. I don't think there's much to the traitor argument, however. He's also been a bit jumpy today, but I think that could be explained by the sheer lack of activity on the part of most of this game's players (sorry guys, I know I'm part of this problem, but I'm working on it).<br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><br>ScumHunter/Bork</span> - I already had a town read from Scumhunter. Looking back, its really not all that well founded. I think his reaction to Dunham's aggression is protown. I also think that the track makes sense given the soft-claim, and the fact that BT was far and away the towniest and most active player. SH's replace-out post strikes me as town...there is likely one scum left and I don't think a scum on his way out would go out of his way to post analysis like that. Not a fool proof point, but its a point in his favor. I don't want to lynch Scumhunter today, but my town read is a lot less clear than I remember it.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Kingdom</span> - I previously considered Kingdom and Carbon about equal in terms of scumminess. They both were major parts of the push for a snake lynch, and neither of them for very good reasons. I don't like his vote on me, nor his switch to Ranmaru. If all of your reads right now are Town, except on null, then  town thing to do would be to reevaluate your reads, not hope that the one you can't read is scum just by pure chance. I mean, he's been pointing to me as someone to consider for most of the game, but always because he can't get a real read. Why the hell not? I have well documented behavior on more than one wagon, and I've chimed in on most of main issues of the game, as well as having pretty clear lynch intentions. Not to mention he claims 'no reason' to see me as town despite my consistent support for the McStab lynch and refusal to join the shitty Snake lynch. Also, you say you have a reason to think Scumhunter is town. What is that again?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Carbon</span> - My main read on carbon is that he is not a very good scumhunter. He seems to nitpick, and really likes the ideas of 'slips' even though they failed thus far, and are honestly just not a good tell in general. Not to mention he's been seiously stretching for a lot of them, as Ranmaru pointed out. That being said, the Carbon case really isn't convincing....I keep getting this feeling that he's town and just really really unsure of how to find scum. This recent back and forth with Ranmaru makes me feel better about him; he's raised some good points, but mostly ones that defeat Ranmaru's, and none that I can get behind that implicate anyone as scum. I don't think he has much of a case on Ranmaru. Also, being very unhelpful by not revealing reads.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Hoopla</span> - I believe I've documented my Hoopla suspicion pretty well. The point he raises about the 3p LYLO is a good point, but I'm still not willing to rule him out.

We'll talk post game.<br><br>@<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Elias</span>: I agree that Carbon seems to be genuinely confused, yet I don't find it as town confusion. The reason why I find it suspicious is because today his playstyle, or rather how he was posting, was a bit different today than before. I didn't notice it because at that time, I wrote it off as him being newbie town trying to help with analysis here and there, but now his true intent has shown today. I don't think he should be written off because of those early feels. Usually he wouldn't have a confident read to push, because he was feeling overwhelmed due to others being much more experienced then him. Consider that his only hard scum reads, were Snake and me. Snake I feel was an easy push for him because Snake was easy to manupulate by even Carbon, it's easy as a newbie to say \"I want to lynch that lurker.\", they don't want to push on stronger players because they can't. Me, I just feel he is doing so because he has already put me as his top scumread because 'I'm trying too hard'. Notice how he kept finding what I was doing TODAY, odd. He was always trying to find something odd about what I was doing. Again, I just felt his overall 'always finding something I say' as a scumslip was starting to seem opportunistic, but still bad. I just didn't notice it as suspicious until today. I can agree that he wouldn't know how to find scum as town, but I don't think he is town trying to help find scum, I think he is scum trying to stretch things and fake reasons to keep his reads 'static', or rather keep them the same. He hasn't done that before as hard as he has today, and that's why it is much more apparent. That's why I find it suspicious of him. <br><br>Here is an example:<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4460509#p4460509\" class=\"postlink\">Post #901</a> shows Carbon actually voting me because of a slip. Ok, we have a back and forth, and then, he still doesn't re-consider his 'finding'. I have fully explained myself, but then he tries to stay ON me, and tries to justify that by stating that I'm just 'trying to be right', but how is this suspicious?<br><br>I still think we should lynch Kingdom today. Even you see it bro, he was trying to lynch you because he didn't feel he could find any townieness in you, which I for one believed was bullshit. I also agree that it was suspicious that he didn't try to re-evaluate his town reads, but instead just tried to paint you and me as lynch options just because of his flimsy PoE.<br><br>I am willing to talk about Hoopla though."}

Basically, he has all town reads and one null read, and was trying to lynch his null (Elias) for not being town enough, but that wasn't really true because there was enough content from Elias to form a read. He even had a null on Hoopla, but it somehow turned into a town read for no reason explained. [Note, he says it wasn't, but never shows where he explained this] He then made an opportunistic push on me for arguing a possibility for scumSCUMhunter which came out of the blue. He is trying to paint me as scum for 'not making sense', and I find he was trying to make up a reason to push on me, then really finding it suspicious. He also was a major push on Snake, like Elias has stated. He had this PoE thing set up, and the 'auto-lynch' reads were [Me, Elias, Snake] and I was the towniest of those. And he continued to go down that list, and even tried to spin a scumread on his once townread-me. How is this not scum trying to get whatever he can [near lylo]. Let's take a look at Kingdom's argument against Snake:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4436405#p4436405\" class=\"postlink\">post 822</a>, KingdomAces wrote:</cite>I think the \"us\" was opposite of forced, there is no reason why he should have been using himself in relation to Snake in that post. It more looks like an accident that he didn't catch. Snake said that McStab intentionally said that to implicate him after McStab's lynch,<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"> but I don't think he would go out of his way to add WIFOM</span> that almost no one would notice.</div></blockquote><br><br>Notice here, that he mentions that he didn't think Mcstab would try harder to add wifom. Basically, he is saying that Mcstab (who flipped scum) put that there by accident, and that it wasn't on purpose. Of course, as shown in Snake's flip, this wasn't the case. Now look at Snake's post (this is not in response to this, but this was the reasoning for why Kingdom believed Snake was scum with Mcstab)<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4432910#p4432910\" class=\"postlink\">post 809</a>, SnakePlissken wrote:</cite>What so someone associates themselves with me as \"us\" <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">and I'm inthe wrong</span></span>.  If I'd have said it then you can bang me to rights on it, otherwise it's pure WIFOM.</div></blockquote><br><br>Underlined, Snake was right. Mcstab was creating a connection to Snake, but Snake wasn't interacting weirdly with Mcstab. It was a one way connection, and both having flipped, this is solid. Now look at Kingdom's response:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4432982#p4432982\" class=\"postlink\">post 811</a>, KingdomAces wrote:</cite>Snake, <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">I'd agree with that in most cases</span></span></span>, <span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">but usually</span> pronouns aren't something that people think too much about before saying. It doesn't seem worth the effort to throw in WIFOM where almost no one is going to notice it.</div></blockquote><br><br>He states that he would agree with that in most cases, but is actually disagreeing with Snake because it would benefit him in lynching him. This is a scum mindset, if he was town, he would have agreed with it and would have re-evaluated his stance here, or do something else, but he didn't. He continued to push the lynch on 'agree to disagree'. Snake even noticed it:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4435104#p4435104\" class=\"postlink\">post 812</a>, SnakePlissken wrote:</cite>So essentially you are agreeing with me then to disagree?

Even after I stated that my only non-town read was Elias being null I looked over some of his posts again and still got nothing. It's not like I've been ignoring him this whole time and now I'm suddenly saying that he must be scum because I've been ignoring him. Under the assumption that there is only one scum left, having all townreads except on one person should by no means mean that I should re-evaluate my reads, it means that the person remaining is probably scum.<br><br>All I'm going to say about the wall posts between Ranmaru and I on page 38 are read them yourself. If you don't want to, don't just take Ranmaru's word that I was accusing him of things he was not guilty of and making him appear scummy through that. He really wasn't making any sense and sounding extremely suspicious while doing so.<br><br>At one point in the back in forth between Carbon and Ranmaru, Carbon pointed out that Ranmaru was simultaneously accusing him of being scum for changing his reads and being scum for sticking to his reads. Ranmaru is doing the exact same thing with me here. Those were the only people I would want to lynch, and nothing has changed my mind on that since then. My townread on Ranmaru was always extremely weak since I didn't have a reason to actually believe it in the first place. I thought Snake/Scooby was scummier at the time, and since he wasn't actually scum I am now assuming it is one of Him/Elias.<br><br>Now for my read on Hoopla, which Ranmaru said that I never once explained. I was going to retype my stance on Hoopla, but instead I think I should just quote every single time I mentioned this read in order to show you exactly how much Ranmaru is ignoring me.<br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: My supposedly non-existent reasoning for my townread on Hoopla</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Before the massclaim, so still assuming the possibility of three scum:<blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4406639#p4406639\" class=\"postlink\">post 665</a>, KingdomAces wrote:</cite>If Hoopla is scum, then it is incredibly likely that the scumteam started with three members.

You want further proof that the scumteam isn't just Hoopla and McStab? On D1 McStab went all out attempting to paint Hoopla in a bad light. That immediately connected the two player slots in a way that after McStab's flip looks a lot like distancing. If they are the only scum, in this case McStab ever flipping would condemn Hoopla, and I doubt McStab would take this risk since he was under suspicion at that point unless there would be something else that would stop town from winning that easily, such as an extra member.

On D2 I realize my stated reasons for thinking McStab's role was more likely a scum one were mostly just too many PR's have claimed/flipped compared to the number of revealed roles at the time. Seeing as at most there was one other PR, that reasoning was clearly wrong even though the conclusion was correct, so someone more experienced in the subject would probably be able to see through this faulty logic. There wasn't anyone else using the setup to determine McStab's alignment, so she just assumed that the best reasoning put forward was the correct one, which was her own.

Hoopla being a traitor would also resolve the scumreads people had on Hoopla with the fact that she is definitely not the second member of a scumteam. Also I think that a traitor is sometimes considered balance wise to to be about half of a full scum member, so if the setup was too townsided as a 10:2 as Ranmaru believes but too scumsided as a 9:3 which should be readily apparent, a traitor would balance both scenarios.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4451434#p4451434\" class=\"postlink\">post 855</a>, KingdomAces wrote:</cite>If we lynch town today, then there is no way that Hoopla is getting lynched tomorrow, because if a traitor does actually exist, then tomorrow it would be two scum out of four alive, otherwise known as an instant win for the scum.

Also, if Hoopla could actually talk to her buddy, she would have told them to kill Dunham at night, not during the day while there was still any chance that she wasn't getting lynched. The more thinking was whether there would be a traitor in this setup. It mostly has to do with how incredibly simple Llamafluff sounds like he likes his setups. Traitors are a bit complex, and since the rest of the scumteam doesn't know their identity it takes away from being able to scumhunt properly, which Llama regularly argues is the most important part of mafia.

Anything else I've never explained?<br><br>Really all I need to say about the rest of the post is when was the last time you used a pronoun in order to WIFOM a town. He may have actually done just that this time, but I don't think most people are going to be looking for pronouns when trying to find connections. Maybe this is more common than I thought it was, or maybe it just so happened that the one time that the one time that someone did actually to hide WIFOM in one was the one time that someone was actually looking. What I meant by I usually would agree with him was if the WIFOM wasn't something that practically no one would notice. I also would like to point out that Ranmaru just quoted everything important Snake posted other than his VT claim from the day he was lynched, even though Ranmaru quoted nowhere near the entire case on him. Frankly, I'm still surprised he actually flipped town."}

Basically, he is saying that Mcstab (who flipped scum) put that there by accident, and that it wasn't on purpose. Of course, as shown in Snake's flip, this wasn't the case.

Mcstab was creating a connection to Snake, but Snake wasn't interacting weirdly with Mcstab. It was a one way connection, and both having flipped, this is solid. Now look at Kingdom's response:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4432982#p4432982\" class=\"postlink\">post 811</a>, KingdomAces wrote:</cite>Snake, <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">I'd agree with that in most cases</span></span></span>, <span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">but usually</span> pronouns aren't something that people think too much about before saying. It doesn't seem worth the effort to throw in WIFOM where almost no one is going to notice it.</div></blockquote><br><br>He states that he would agree with that in most cases, but is actually disagreeing with Snake because it would benefit him in lynching him. This is a scum mindset, if he was town, he would have agreed with it and would have re-evaluated his stance here, or do something else, but he didn't. He continued to push the lynch on 'agree to disagree'. Snake even noticed it:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4435104#p4435104\" class=\"postlink\">post 812</a>, SnakePlissken wrote:</cite>So essentially you are agreeing with me then to disagree?

What follows is this exchange:<blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4336145#p4336145\" class=\"postlink\">post 221</a>, Elias_the_thief wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4335759#p4335759\" class=\"postlink\">post 219</a>, BT wrote:</cite>Other things.

This goes unmentioned when he votes Robbnva a few posts later, like it wasn't in consideration at all when choosing his vote.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4324219#p4324219\" class=\"postlink\">post 74</a>, Elias_the_thief wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4324030#p4324030\" class=\"postlink\">post 70</a>, KingdomAces wrote:</cite>Elias, do you find that being wrong is a scumtell, and if so how? That seems to be your entire case on both Robbnva and McStab.</div></blockquote><br>Well first, let's not throw the word case around lightly. I pointed out flaws in McStab's logic and I'm waiting for a response. My point about Robb is not that he's wrong. Its that he KNOWS protown players sometimes self-vote, while simultaneously believing that a self-vote from Hoopla = definite scum. As I said in my initial post, it reads as if he just jumped on what he thought was an easy lynch.</div></blockquote><br>Kingdom calls his comment on McStab a case and Elias hurries to explain that it's simply pointing out logic flaws. Doesn't that mean you didn't have \"a case\" on Robbnva either?</div></blockquote><br>I never claimed to have a case on Robb. In this post I refer to my posts against Robb as \"my point\". I had nothing specific that made me think McStab was scum. I suppose you could refer to what I had on Robb as a case, but I personally never would. He just seemed eager for an easy lynch, which seemed a whole lot more damning than misinterpreting a post.</div></blockquote>*Note: Elias actually left this out when he quoted it. I re-added it for future reference.<br><br>After this the conversation focuses more on Robb than McStab. While I may have been wrong calling it a case in the first place, he is incredibly jumpy when I do.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4339889#p4339889\" class=\"postlink\">post 266</a>, BT wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4339280#p4339280\" class=\"postlink\">post 260</a>, McStab wrote:</cite>And he also makes an associative link between Kingdom and me without a flip. More great play.</div></blockquote>I do intend to look into that, but the reads I'm getting from both of you aren't stellar so I don't see the problemo in this.</div></blockquote>The only connection BT mentions between McStab and me is in the post quoted above, where he says I'll look at this connection later, but for the moment the only actual connection he shows is the one between McStab and Elias, which McStab avoids. On that note, McStab only mentions Elias once day one, and that had nothing to do with his read on Elias.<br><br>For some reason I got the impression that Elias was a lot more supportive of a McStab lynch D1, but this is the closest he gets:<blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4351211#p4351211\" class=\"postlink\">post 367</a>, Elias_the_thief wrote:</cite>I think BT's case on McStab is the most convincing yet.
