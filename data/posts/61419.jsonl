Play to win, not to lose-this should be obvious, do not purposely let your team down<br>2. Do not quote or screenshot ANY PMs I send you, this includes role PMs and any discussions I have, doing so will result in a modkill<br>3. Once a post is made, do not edit it even if you have the ability to do so, you can't take back what you say IRL easily, so why would you be able to do it here?<br>4. No text encryption, hard-to-read fonts or any other means of hiding text from other players<br>5. Dead means dead, once you die you are not allowed to post in this thread at all, sorry to those that like to make \"bah!\" posts but that is not allowed this game<br>6. Unless the role I give you says so, you may not talk to anyone in this game outside of this thread<br>7. I don't mind a little bit of heated discussion, but if there are ANY personal attacks, flaming, insults and poor sportsmanship will result in a warning, a second offence and...*pulls gun out and shoots in the air* you get the idea (Mod-kill)<br>8. Rule 8 about ongoing games, do not talk about ongoing games outside of their own threads, doing so is an instant force-replacement or mod-kill<br><br>9. Day phases last for 2 weeks, night phases last 48 hours<br>10. Even though a hammer has been made, players can continue to talk during the twilight phase, INCLUDING the player to be lynched<br>11. If I don't receive a night action before the deadline, you will not be able to take any action that night<br>12. In the event you can't post during a night phase, feel free to PM me the action you wish performed the night before<br>13. I will extend the deadline if events mean it is necessary, not because players request it<br>14. Please use either the bold tag or vote tag when voting, nicknames are fine providing I can easily determine a player's name, votes would look like this, vote: kelbris or VOTE: kelbris<br>15. Unvotes are helpful, but do not worry if you don't do one as they are not mandatory<br>16. No sneaky stuff relating to votes, if it looks like a vote, I will count it as one<br>17. A player will only be lynched if over half the players vote for him/her, I shall indicate the amount of votes needed for a hammer in each VC<br>18. If there is not a majority by the end of a day, that day ends in a no-lynch<br>19. Once a player is destined for the noose, NOTHING can change their terrible fate<br>20. Some other votes include vote: no lynch to end the day without a kill (requires a majority of players) and vote: draw to end the game in a draw which must be agreed upon by ALL remaining players<br><br>21. You must post at least once every 48 hours or you will be prodded<br>22. If you do not post within 24 hours of receiving a prod, you will be replaced, same applies if you are prodded more then 3 times<br>23. If you know you will be unable to participate for a few days, let me know via PM or in the thread so I don't prod you without reason<br>24. If you see any errors with my VC, deadlines or anything else please let me know so I can correct them<br>25. I shall not answer any role-specific questions in-thread, if you have a question about your role please send them via PM, I will not answer questions about the roles of other players at all, no trickery in an attempt to fool me into revealing a role will be tolerated and will result in an immediate MK<br>26. If you need to get my attention, please use @mod or @kelbris in your post, using bold is preferred<br>27. If you have any complaints about another player, send them to me via PM and I will do my best to resolve the situation<br>28. If I need to MK someone during the day, that day ends immediately to keep the flow of the game<br><br>29. <span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">I use the color red, DO NOT USE IT</span></span><br>30. Flavor text is NOT relevant to the game, analyze it and you could find yourself suffering a terrible fate<br>31. I will not MK, force-replace or do anything to a player just because someone asks me to, I make the calls in that regard, no-one else<br>32. As moderator, my word is final, please respect my decisions and instructions<br>33. I reserve the right to change these rules at any time if necessary, if this happens I shall notify everyone of the rule change in-thread<br>34. All site-wide rules apply as well as the above rules<br>35. You can not claim a color as your own<br>36.

The whole game is not you winning personal arguments with other players, that's not going to get us anywhere.  You need to build a case that can be convincing to town and part of doing that is making it reasonably easy to follow the argument.  When you provide quotes without attribution, it can be hard to follow.  It can also be deceptive (intentionally or not) when the person being quoted changes but there is no easy way for the reader to know.<br><br>If you're town, you should be trying to make your arguments clear, not obfuscating them.  I am at a loss to understand why you wouldn't know this already, and are going so far as to challenge other players who are pointing it out to you.<br><br>It can be really annoying to manage quote tags in these forums.  I find that if I open a new browser window and select a section of text from a post I want to quote, then press the \"quote\" button, I get a nice chunk of text that I can paste into the post I am working on, that pasted text containing all of the nice linky details you'd ever want to have to make it easy for people to follow."}

He picked you randomly as someone to push on in a really bizarre tunnel-y way, as some kind of weak and ineffectual scum hunting technique (applying nonsensical pressure to someone to see how they'd react).<br><br>3. He's not paying close attention to the game and just decided to go with a tunnel as the most bang-for-the-buck early play.<br><br>I certainly agree with you that his behavior is weird and demands explanation.  I'm just not willing to go all the way to concluding he is definitively scum because of it.  You'll notice that I'm voting him, because I did find his claims to be worried about town losing seemed faked/forced for the purpose of appearing townie.  So I am also suspicious of him.  I just don't find the logical leap from \"he's doing weird bussing\" to \"he decided to bus me before the game even began\" to be compelling.<br><br>Let's keep an eye on the guy, but please don't tunnel too hard on him yourself, as I believe tunneling on Unlynchable is probably not the best play for town at this early juncture of the game."}

But I think we all recognize that a certain amount of appealing to meta is normal and can be beneficial in supporting arguments if used in the right way.  Although arguments based solely on meta are right out.  One of my biggest pet peeves in this game (in my whole 4 games (including this one) of experience) is when people <span style=\"font-style: italic\">ask for</span> examples of meta as evidence of an argument.  For example:<br><br>Player A: I always do X when Y.<br>Player B: Can you give me a game link showing how you always do X when Y?<br>Player A: OK, here you go!<br>Player B: I see, I guess you were telling the truth.<br><br>That's just ridiculously bad, because player A can be totally gaming their statement in advance knowing that they'll be able to cherrypick an example from a prior game to \"support\" their statement.  And furthermore, a single example doesn't prove that Player A \"always\" does X when Y anyway.  And furthermore, just because they \"always\" did it before doesn't mean they're doing it now.<br><br>In such an exchange, I get very suspicious of both player A and player B because A is using such an easily gamed statement, and B asked for what they must know is non-evidence and then accepted it.  Feels like a charade meant to imply that B was suspicious of A when they really weren't.<br><br>Anyway, this is not particularly relevant to this game at this point, so back to your regularly scheduled programming ..."}

Example:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6775573#p6775573\" class=\"postlink\">post 366</a>, RadiantCowbells wrote:</cite>No, I don't care to answer, given that you somehow failed to realize the only thing I was doing in that post was questioning Mofu's logic.</div></blockquote><br><br>RC is refusing to answer questions while continuing to make vague assertions that only invite more questions that she's then going to refuse to answer.  It can be maddening to deal with someone who behaves like this, because you keep asking them stuff and they keep just not responding, but not in a way that even lets you just let it go.  Hypothetical example:<br><br>Player A: I don't think I need to answer that, it's obvious why I did it and it's clear that X is scum.<br>Player B: Why do you say that it's clear that X is scum?<br>Player A: You're not getting it, just read my posts and you'll know the answer.  Now I'm starting to think you're scum.<br>Player B: What?   If I could feel confident in the answer by reading your posts, I wouldn't be asking the question.  And now I'm scum?  Explain.<br>Player A: I don't explain myself to scum.<br><br>etc.etc.<br><br>Player B can't let player A's statements go because they continue to imply things that demand response, and yet player A constantly stonewalls player B, who can't really get anywhere.  Player B gets tired of having to ask questions that aren't going to be answered, and also tired of Player A making posts that require being questioned instead of just saying in more detail what they mean.  When we make partial statements that we could have just explained in our original post, and then require others to have to ask us to clarify something that we should have just made sure was clear in the first place as a courtesy to other players ... that gets annoying.<br><br>RC was annoying Scripten in this way, and when pisskop came along and did more of the same thing, I think it drove Scripten a little over the edge.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6776252#p6776252\" class=\"postlink\">post 381</a>, pisskop wrote:</cite>1) thats weak Scripten.

People who don't care don't bother to call other people \"dumbasses\", nor do they make threats about \"fucking over the team\" (by the way playing against your win condition violates both the spirit of and the actual rules of the game).  Also you're smarter than your claim that people have to \"work with you\" while at the same time doing everything in your power to make it so that no one can effectively work with you (which is how I see your \"tantrum\" as PB is calling it).

You cannot say that you'll take actions that would fuck over town without violating the game rules.  So pisskop has put himself in a position where he is either claiming an intent to violate the rules, or is scum for whom fucking over town wouldn't be a rules violation.  The thing I don't know is, does pisskop realize that?  Or is his rage really not faked, is it real, and he just doesn't understand what he's saying?"}

You claim that he could have decided not to join the game given whatever he doesn't like about you as a player, rather than join it and have to tunnel you early based on whatever his position is on you.  This implies that he was thinking about you as a player before the game began and had a plan on what to do about you.<br><br>I think I probably accidentally used the wrong word when I said 'bus' in that comment that you quoted, because obv. that implies that you're both scum.  I meant to say 'tunnel'.  If you're both scum it would be bussing, but I didn't mean to imply that in my comment because that was not my read at the time (nor is it now).<br><br>TL;DR:<br><br>I meant to use the words 'tunneling' and 'tunnel' in that quote, not 'bussing' and 'bus'.<br><br>Dare I even ask if you have any comments on anything else in this game aside from Unynchable?"}

If anything, those are not congruent opinions and Scripten looks worse. Conversely, his reasoning in 70 might be town. At least he provided something to answer BBT's question. Ironically, I initially didn't like him because his RVS post sounded \"authentically paranoid.\" Scripten, can you link me to a time where you have accurately accused someone of being scum based on a paranoid-seeming RVS vote?<br><br>I like RC's BBT vote.<br><br>I know this isn't much and it's very behind but I think there's some valuable different points of view in there and I want Scripten to answer that question so I'll just post this for now and do more later."}

You're taking attention away from your scum buddies at the same time since you're making the game all about <span class=\"noboldsig\">you</span>, keeping people occupied with trying to figure out your fake claim, and stringing people along with vague arguments that you claim are so convincing that everyone feels like if they conclude that you're full of shit, they'll be missing something.<br><br>Try to see the game from the point of view of anyone except yourself, you may find that elucidating.  How would you feel about me if I had built up a case that was no more convincing than three or four others that have been made here, then threw a tantrum because nobody was willing to just believe me, then claimed doctor out of the blue, then/concurrently with that was all pissy and insulting?"}

Why should she have believed that you would have self hammered?  I certainly didn't believe you were that bad of a player (but I've been proven wrong).  Why should she have?  (yes, she pointed out in 726 that your saying 'one more vote' was a threat to self hammer, that just explains what you meant, it doesn't mean that she or anyone else actually believed you would do it).<br><br>2. Why would Wanderer, if she's scum, even put herself in a position to be criticized in that way?  If she is scum, she's been playing a pretty cautions game as one, I haven't seen her involved in any direct confrontations with anyone.  Suddenly deciding to jump into the spotlight by effectively hammering you is incongruent with that.<br><br>3. Why is it not believable that she didn't know that she was really putting you at L-1?  I personally did not know what the exact vote count was, it's kind of hard to keep track of and one does get tired of having to skim through pages of posts to do a vote count in your head.  Not to mention that this is an error prone means of counting votes.<br><br>All you're doing at this point is weakening whatever case you're trying to make that we should vote PB because you're so obviously correct about stuff.  The very best thing you could do for town right now is to explain why you self hammered and take away our doubt (or my doubt at least, not sure how everyone else feels) about whether there is anything at all worth listening to you about."}

Because that's just unfair to other players in games for one player to choose their meta over the current game.  The other game that pisskop and I were in together finished during this game's Night 1 so I can finally talk about it openly.  In that game (Mini 1652, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=60961\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=60961</a>), pisskop also early claimed (as \"informed town\"), and also used some similar phrasing in this game (\"you're giving me a heart attack/stop breaking my heart/etc\").  I thought possibly he was trying to fake claim here using that other game as \"evidence\" that this is how he plays, especially given that I personally would be very familiar with his play in 1652.  But apparently he was just using both games to try to establish a meta.  I am confident that in some upcoming game he <span class=\"noboldsig\">is</span> going to fake claim early as scum and try to use these games as \"evidence\".  Despicable.<br><br>Enough about pisskop.<br><br>I think these players were heavily involved in Day 1:<br><br>BlueBloodedToffee<br>Scripten<br>RadiantCowbells<br>bji<br>pisskop<br><br>I think these players were involved in Day 1, but to a lesser extent:<br><br>Garmr<br>PeaceBringer<br>Wanderer-nl<br><br>I think these players mostly lurked Day 1:<br><br>massive<br>Slandaar<br>evilpacman18<br><br>I think these players completely lurked Day 1:<br><br>Unlynchable<br>Mofonugen<br><br>OK so, scum killed at least one player from the lurky category.  As I said before, this suggests to me that there was little/no benefit in killing players from the \"actually playing the game\" category, which implies that the scum were not in any particular danger after Day 1.  The scum kill of either Slandaar or evilpacman18 suggests to me that scum liked the Day 1 fighting between BBT/RC/me/Scripten.  Of all the players in that group, there are two who have mostly escaped scum reads during Day 1: BBT and me.  I'm not scum, so the only interesting person in the category of \"players who played hard day 1 but didn't get many scum reads\" is BBT.<br><br>Therefore, I categorize my likely scum as BBT, and one or more of the lurkers.  I have really no reason aside from this analysis to regard BBT as scum, but I am going to retain suspicion there based on how Day 1 played out.  I am much more interested in the lurkers for whom a continuation of Day 1 play is most beneficial.  In the hardly playing/lurker still alive category we have massive, Unlynchable, and Mofonugen.  Of these, I prefer massive and Mofonugen to Unlynchable for today's lynch.<br><br>And then there is post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6792101#p6792101\">773</a>, which I find very convincing.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Mofonugen</span>"}

In real time during Day 1 I found myself agreeing with BBT alot, both in his approach and in his conclusions.  So I feel like all I have in terms of suspicion against him right now is the fact that he participated so heavily during Day 1, and looks to me like a strong town player, and yet wasn't killed.  I don't think that in and of itself is a strong argument, because it could equally apply to several other people (including me, if I'm immodest enough to call myself a \"strong town player\").  But it's something.  It just pales in comparison to how strongly I feel about the likelihood of one of the lurkers being scum.<br><br>I'm sure I'm not helping my case by stating it before I've gone back and re-read all of Day 1 and formed more solid opinions.  I'll be doing that shortly."}

Doesn't feel too fabricated and stays consistent with questioning, also honest-looking. Townlean, but would like more content. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">And then he died and flipped VT.</span><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">BBT:</span> Agressive scumhunting, asks lots of questions and pushes us out of RVS as fast as he possibly can. That looks towny, and is a good spot to hide in for scum. Though our opinions seemed to match a lot which made me lean more townish on him. Hops a lot between votes and I just don't know what to think about that. Is he voting to get a reaction or is he throwing these votes around hoping one will stick and turn into a bandwagon? Will keep an eye on him day 2, would like to think BBT is town because he looks pro-active to me, but honestly, I don't know.<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Garmr:</span> Has a townread on RC very early in the game. Proceeds to defend RC later on as well. How can he already be so sure RC is town? He had a 1v1 early with BBT which to me felt tvt. Due to V/LA there isn't much more content. Almost null, little to the scumside for being so sure of another player when you can't be.<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">scripten:</span> A lot of questioning (and arguing with) RC and Pisskop. I find it hard to actually read scripten's motives, but I get the feeling he's town so null-townlean there.<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Peacebringer:</span> Doesn't believe Pisskop and gets into a metawar, goes as far as to find games and that might be a little too much trouble for scum to go through. And even if scum would try, it would be questioned because it stands out. But then again, so many people were in the metawar or other kind of questioning with Pisskop so this was easy for scum to get into as well. As opposed to scripten, I get a more scummy feeling from Pb's posts, so null-scumlean.<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">RadiantCowbells:</span> So I did check some of her games and this does look like her playingstyle. It's a meta that's going to be easy to hide behind as scum in my opinion. Lets drop the meta now, shall we? During twilight she changed a lot who she wanted to vote most day 2, I thought that was a little weird because that made it look she didn't have strong scumreads, while she expressed earlier she did. So still scumread on RC.<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">evilpacman18:</span> Got in the game very late but I did like the content. I felt he was looking for discussion by pointing out there were so many differences in reads/opinions, to me that looks like he isn't looking for the easiest target (something scum would be doing) so townlean (quite strong) on epc for now. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">And died a VT.</span><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">unlynchable:</span> Change your name to unreadable. No content at all, just trying to push a PL on Slandaar. He acts scummy, but like I said; unreadable. However, the likelyhood of town behaving this way is very small so that would make me think he's scum. <br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">bji:</span> I agree too much with bji to make a good read I think. Townread.<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">mofonugen:</span> Posted some early reads but other than that there isn't much content. While I can see mofo's argument for voting Pisskop, I think it was too early in the day to use that particular reason for voting a claimed doctor. Doesn't weigh in on all the other discussions that are going on with Pisskop so it feels like a naked vote to me with some fabricated reasoning to make it look legit. Scumlean.<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Pisskop</span> Plays an anti-town game, very defensive of another player very early in the day (only scum have info), claims doc (afaik the most popular pr for scum to claim) way too early in the day, proceeds playing an anti-town game. Feels scum but might be just annoying/annoyed. Worth lynching anyway. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">lynched, was town doctor</span> (this read is the only one I wrote after I saw the flip)<br><br>So I included the players that died because I made my notes before night ended. I think it's rather incomplete, what I wrote, but that's because I keep getting frustrated over all the meta-stuff. I hope I can be more helpful from now on."}

I didn't claim all the way into LYLO and the night before LYLO I had investigated a scum.  My plan in LYLO was to try to get the scum lynched without having to claim, and only claim if that wasn't going to happen.  Then one of my idiot town teammates got himself mod killed and it was suddenly game over.  So I can see how it's not a bad idea to claim as cop when you have nabbed scum, but I think if it were me I would have let the day go as far as possible to see if I could have gotten the lynch to happen without having to claim.  Better to live on as an unclaimed cop and still get the guilty party lynched.  So I'm still a bit suspicious of Garmr's claim.<br><br>That being said, if others think making a guess is a good idea, OK.  I will guess Wanderer-nl, based on three factors:<br><br>1. Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6782515#p6782515\">765</a> from Garmr: \"Wanderer,scriptian, massive all seem pretty scummy to me\" is his last read list before the flip, so he probably investigated one of those.<br>2. There was some debate at the flip about whether or not Wanderer's L-2 vote was scummy, this made interest in her one of the last things happening before the flip, and maybe that influenced Garmr's choice<br>3. In post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6793536#p6793536\">808</a>, Wanderer could be construed as possibly starting a case against Garmr.  If Garmr knew that Wanderer was scum, he might want to claim cop quickly before starting any arguments with Wanderer so that his claim wouldn't look just like an attempt to discredit the person he was arguing with."}

Why get so upset just because BBT and a few others have questioned your veracity?  Didn't you expect that when you made the claim?  You should have.  And then using being upset like that as an excuse to reveal your target, feels like realizing that you are not as likely to get info out of the guesses as you'd hoped and are more likely to see people waver on believing the claim, so fall back to revealing the target immediately in hopes of getting the day to end before anyone realizes the claim is fake.<br><br>4.

She was looking kind of guilty to alot of people after Day 1 and I suspect that scum had a decent chance of maneuvering for a lynch of her without having to fake claim.<br><br>2. Why risk a scum slot just to get a single townie lynched?  Scum's ahead at this point, with 3 town deaths and no scum deaths thus far.  Is a gambit that will sacrifice a scum for a townie worth it?  I wouldn't think so.<br><br>3. Why would the scum team have Garmr be the one to make the fake cop claim?  Garmr was not really on anyone's scum radar, seems it would have been better to select a more scum-read person to fake claim on the assumption that if people were going to believe the fake claim, it would be better to sacrifice someone more likely to be lynched anyway than Garmr."}

If that's the case then I guess it would be a good strategy to trade a scum slot for 5 townies (three the first night, because scum Garmr would live, town Wanderer would die, and scum would kill two more townies, then two the second night, as scum Garmr would be lynched and scum then get to choose two more townie deaths).  However, giving scum two kills per night would really unbalance the game in favor of scum I think and so I really doubt the game was set up that way."}

If you really are town, then I wish I'd left it a little while longer as I contemplated whether or not we should lynch Garmr.  The problem is that I just couldn't see any way in which that was the safer bet; and massive's point about how much effort it would have taken Garmr to set up that fake claim was convincing.  I kind of thought in the back of my head \"well maybe he didn't make it up, maybe he just saw an opportunity to use something that happened on its own\", but I decided to ignore that possibility because the chance seemed more remote.<br><br>Also like I mentioned, I don't really know much about framers but the wiki says we shouldn't expect one in this game because they're not \"normal\".<br><br>I am a bit worried when I think about why Garmr would have made that gambit.  Trading a scum for a townie doesn't seem all that worth it, unless like I said scum get 2x kills per night and then this is more of a 5-for-1.  But if this game was set up for 2x scum kills per night, I'm going to throw my hands up and say the whole thing was doomed from the outset.  I've completed 3 games and never seen town win, I don't know why a game would need a setup slanted in scum favor."}

Calling me a awful player and such but what you don't realize you are just as bad if not worse.

I don't win those games by lynching town with fake cop claims and drawing the heat when I was in comfortable position that's to much risk even for me. I don't think anyone actually will do that. <br><br><br>I think why you got lynched also shows you had bad play as you got too emotional and when you were emotional you didn't provide any real cases.

The way you worded it felt like you had knowledge of the circumstances to even through you were pretending not to."}
