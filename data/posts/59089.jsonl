In the summer heat, the thirst for a majestic, refreshing beverage was getting the better out of 14 individuals. One man, known only as the DoctorPepper had carried exactly 13 cans of Dr Pepper, it was a weird case but nonetheless the inhabitants of the small unit knew it was a blessing. Unfortunately, DoctorPepper is a selfish bastard who decided that nobody got any of the Pepper, which infuriated the rest of the inhabitants of the small shelter.<br>\n<br>\nDeep into the night, as everyone slept, a scream was heard. Everyone arose from their slumber to find out that DoctorPepper had been murdered. A can of his own soda was next to him, empty. But the worst part of. That was, somebody had stolen all of the Dr Pepper. <br>\n<br>\nNow this household is on the lookout for the perpetrators of this heinous crime.

When Rambler asks TTH about what in the chat made her distrust BBT, that action feels like something a Townie would do. It's also reasonable for him to have felt her post looked like an RVS in that post: I had the same initial feeling, because I've never heard of Neighbors having pre-game chat. In fact, every game I've played in that had Neighbors never let you talk until Daystart. Talking before the game starts does sound like something Scum would have, though. So him sharing that sentiment strikes a chord. What I really find odd and disconcerting is Rambler completely ignoring my question directed towards him in (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6197966#p6197966\">24</a>).

If one flips Town, hyperlynch the other. <br>\n<br>\nI don't know what to make of this situation here. BBT and TTH are supposedly Neighbors, and have pregame talk. I've never heard of Neighbors having that. Ever. This could jst be a really risky gambit by Scum. They could both be Scum with Daytalk, and have concocted an elaborate hoax.

When Rambler asks TTH about what in the chat made her distrust BBT, that action feels like something a Townie would do. It's also reasonable for him to have felt her post looked like an RVS in that post: I had the same initial feeling, because I've never heard of Neighbors having pre-game chat. In fact, every game I've played in that had Neighbors never let you talk until Daystart. Talking before the game starts does sound like something Scum would have, though. So him sharing that sentiment strikes a chord. What I really find odd and disconcerting is Rambler completely ignoring my question directed towards him in (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6197966#p6197966\">24</a>).

I do like his inquiry on how many Neighbors there are. Unsure the gameplay philosophy on alignment and the outing of one's Neighborhood. More often in my experience it's been Town that does so. Not always, but usually. I think his mention of Scum doing so because it's useful for them is more wrong than right, because Scum probably doesn't want even more attention brought to them.

He keeps talking like he knows there is a killing role out there other than scum's factional kill. Him bringing up the vigilante constantly to kill someone regardless of alignment is odd to me. Granted, I understand how he could be annoyed by the fact I said I would hammer, but come on man. I said I was a village idiot, I'm just clowning around. It seems as if he is trying to set himself up for a vigilante claim later in the game, which is another reason he's so out to kill me specifically. I'm being targeted to seem like a vigilante will kill me in the night, when in actuality, a serial killer will be doing it, and then he'll be able to fake claim Vigilante and get away with it. On the flipside, the possibility of him being scum, and hoping for a second kill to potentially get a mislynch is also a possibility.

Now obviously you're mentioning a Vig/Serial Killer in this game. If you're crumbing Vig, stop. If so you're way too obvious. And if you're Scum crumbing Vig it's likely not going to work as the Days go by. Maybe if a Vig exists you should implore that it attempt to kill someone it/everyone finds Scummy, instead of someone who may or may not be playing anti-Town. You're being anti-Town and divisive by calling Boonskiies a useless piece of shit. For pete's sake stop doing that. I'm slightly scumreading you for doing that, and for your questions beeing safe. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Where The Player Stands</div></div><br>\nOverall, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">[Slightly Scum]</div></div>. Don't be anti-Town. Two wrongs don't make a right. Scum wants the Town to be divided. Also if you're Town get out of your comfort zone and start asking some really pointed questions to get the discussions churning. Remember, if you die you still win if Scum's eradicated, so don't play safe. Otherwise you'll just be seen as being self-preserving, which is something Scum does.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Rambler</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6199888#p6199888\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6199888#p6199888\" data-post-id=\"6199888\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 69</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=22272\">Wake1</a> wrote:</cite><div style=\"text-align:center\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 175%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8040BF\">Rambler I</div></div></div><br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">(4) | (17) | (46) | (47) | (50)</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">What We Know</div></div><br>\nRambler asks TTH in (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6197735#p6197735\">17</a>) about what specifically about the pre-game chat made her distrust BBT.

I do like his inquiry on how many Neighbors there are. Unsure the gameplay philosophy on alignment and the outing of one's Neighborhood. More often in my experience it's been Town that does so. Not always, but usually. I think his mention of Scum doing so because it's useful for them is more wrong than right, because Scum probably doesn't want even more attention brought to them.

GreyICE is a serious player. Serious players do not like players who lurk to victory; lurkers earn a lot of disdain from serious players. Welllll, guess what other types of players they don't like? Trolls. The nature of a bboard game takes away our ability to size up one's body language and vocal tone. The only clues we have to use are the other players' written words. Trolls, rpers and masks take away those clues nearly as much as lurkers. Basically, in a serious players' eyes you are either scum or you are a liability to the town. Either way, you should be taken out as soon as possible (preferably by the night game). If everyone adopted your play style, this game would become very chance based (much like epicmafia). That isn't the type of game that most mafiascummers wish to play. This is why GreyICE wants to see your corpse.", "time": "Mon Sep 08, 2014 4:30 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59089&start=100", "forum": "53", "thread": "59089"}

GreyICE is a serious player. Serious players do not like players who lurk to victory; lurkers earn a lot of disdain from serious players. Welllll, guess what other types of players they don't like? Trolls. The nature of a bboard game takes away our ability to size up one's body language and vocal tone. The only clues we have to use are the other players' written words. Trolls, rpers and masks take away those clues nearly as much as lurkers. Basically, in a serious players' eyes you are either scum or you are a liability to the town. Either way, you should be taken out as soon as possible (preferably by the night game). If everyone adopted your play style, this game would become very chance based (much like epicmafia). That isn't the type of game that most mafiascummers wish to play.

It wouldn't be surprising if most members on this site had at least one legitimate alternate. As for the second question, I'm not sure. It's definitely a Scumslip in my opinion, but she's asking the other player if he/she has played with me before, while asking how to go about tackling a read like that. TTH's #3 is completely disjointed and looks like it was meant for the Mafia QT, because BBT never asked or said anything about other players in the game. BBT asks how to start the Day, and TTH immediately starts talking about a player, as if they had been in that conversation... when they weren't.", "time": "Tue Sep 09, 2014 9:29 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59089&start=150", "forum": "53", "thread": "59089"}

TTH's #3 is completely disjointed and looks like it was meant for the Mafia QT, because BBT never asked or said anything about other players in the game.

Anywho...<br>\n<br>\nI don't know if I necessarily see Wake as scummy rather than just pissed off town. I've played with Wake multiple times, and I'm one of the few who actually like playing with Wake, and he seems to always be targeted by scum as a mislynch. Granted, I've never actually seen Wake as scum that I remember. But Wake is definitely one of the people who scum use to make an easy mislynch. He's very proactive and I believe he overthinks things. I don't feel like Wake should be lynched toDay. I always seem to enjoy having a town Wake alive later in the game. <br>\n<br>\nThat being said, I see why people are on him, even if they are town. He does seem scummy, but he's Wake.

I see originally why he would want his supposed neighbor to be possibly lynched, but when things started turning into a \"we lynch one, if they flip town, we lynch the other one\" kind of deal, he backed off. I believe he's probably going to bring this up later, when he would be more okay with being lynch. Afterwards, he sees Anatole vs Wake happening and picks a side. He's directly involved with the two, but he is staying under the radar. This makes me have a potential feeling that BBT is trying for a mislynch on either one of them leading into a second mislynch on the other.

I believe he's probably going to bring this up later, when he would be more okay with being lynch. Afterwards, he sees Anatole vs Wake happening and picks a side. He's directly involved with the two, but he is staying under the radar.

You will, therefore, not be surprised to learn that reason can be applied to you as well. BBT and scrambles apparently think that you scum slipped by saying \"when\" instead of \"if\". Me? My reasons are a bit different.<br>\n<br>\nI'm going to pick it up from #195. In your next post (#294), you reveal that you considered voting BBT, but decided on TTH instead as BBT had too many votes. Post #294, in general, signals that this is a policy vote for the neighbors rather than anything else. That policy vote sentiment is echoed in later posts. So far, no problems.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6206584#p6206584\">Post #350</a>: this is the Anatole + BBT + TTH case. I've touched on it before, but I'd like to add a bit more.<br>\n\"That was literally the scummiest thing I've seen. I'm almost certain it was forged, or details were ommited. The formatting was off, as if someone editted it. <br>\nAnyone notice that?\" No, I didn't. However, that is grade A, smoking gun evidence (if true). That is not the sort of thing that one just glosses over. If you actually believed it, then I think it would have triggered a vote on BBT. At the very least, you would have pointed out where you think the problem lay. Anyway, statements like that push your view on BBT away from policy lynch.<br>\n<br>\nPost #380. You thought 3 other players were convincing about BBT's guilt, but you were worried about actually lynching BBT. This should not be a concern, if you believe that BBT is scum. You seem more worried about what effect your vote on BBT might have on yourself.<br>\n<br>\nPost #381 <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>The more I think about it, the less I am convinced he is a strong scum read.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">BBT and TTH on the other hand, are</div></div>, so that's why I'm unvoting.<br>\n<br>\nA flip from either BBT and TTH would reveal a lot as well.</div></blockquote><br>\n No! You can't go back to policy lynch with a snap of the fingers. Not after what you've already said. Just entertaining this thought once more shows a lack of conviction in your read on BBT. You've said BBT is your scum read. You've stated that BBT and TTH are not scum together. You can not lump TTH in with BBT again! NO!!!<br>\n<br>\nPast here, we get into my more recent posts. Your case on BBT does not hold up. Thus, it appears that you aren't actually analyzing BBT. It appears that you are just making things up to justify your vote on BBT so you can deny having a \"me too!\" vote on him.", "time": "Sat Sep 13, 2014 3:29 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59089&start=450", "forum": "53", "thread": "59089"}

As for the BBT/TTH Neighbor issue, there are possibilities yet to be addressed in the future. I need to get current on my massive read first, and then branch out from there. I think it's more likely that they are Neighbors, because if either of them flips something else, they other is auto-lynched. A slightly-less-likely possibility is that they're Scum quoting parts of the QT and making it look as if they're Neighbors. That DP wouldn't clarify when asked directly doesn't help my mind move in another direction.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Why have you been so inactive, massive?

I could see an Anatole, Csareo, or flubbernugget lynch. All the lurkers in this game have me a bit bothered, too. Not sure about BBT, and TTH and Boonskiies don't feel like they've really engaged me in this game. Then again, they probably wouldn't want to be drawn into an epic interrogation/struggle for survival if they're Scum. I don't particularly like going nutso-aggressive on a player when they end up flipping Town, either, which is why I'm always very comfortable with reserving my vote until enough discussion has gone by.<br>\n<br>\nIf you check my meta you'll likely note that I'm almost always reserving my vote.

So that gives me pause to credit a \"playstyle\" defense, as it can be used pretty well by scum, but I'm still weighing what Flubber had to say.

He isn't taking shots at people and scum reading are two separate things. I only believe he has around 4 scum reads max, and some are wear scum reads for him, and he isn't pushing them as much. BBT is basically the only one he is pushing for, so I don't understand. Even we he strays a little, it's all based on him feeling that BBT is scum. I do believe he is town reading people. You can usually tell who people are town reading based off their interactions and scum reads alone. This being said, I believe Csareo is town reading Wake, but you really can't be too sure at this time in game really.

How about now?</div></blockquote><br>\nI'm back everybody.  I go away for a weekend and this whole place blows up.  Crazy catching up, if I miss something, please let me know.<br>\n<br>\n1.  I never heard of Neighbors before.  In the next post, it was response to GreyIce who posted a previous AK game where I read all the role PMs and the PT so I got the idea of how Neighbors worked.  It also showed that GreyIce mischaracterised AK's experience.  I then read a couple of other AK games (just the role PM's and final results) to confirm that AK wasn't lying.  <br>\n2.  It wasn't the vote on scrambles, it was the vote on AK that really got under my skin.  Greyice started a bad wagon based upon LaL and BBT didn't even bother to read the link to see if Greyice was correct before throwing a vote down.  <br>\n3A.  If BBT hadn't quick jumped onto the wagon that Greyice started, I would have voted for Greyice just for misleading us.  As scummy as I thought that was, BBT was scummier for jumping on that wagon.  <br>\n3B.  I felt I couldn't leave my vote on BBT for fear of Boonskies troll hammer coming in and we still had plenty of time (and I wanted to see if a counter wagon appeared) so I thought putting my vote on Greyice would help provide pressure on him, hopefully to get him to answer why he threw down some BS and then disappeared.   <br>\n4.  The scumminess was BBT sheeping Greyice and Greyice throwing down a BS LaL arguement.  We also had the whole AK vs Wake thing to go through which I felt was Town vs Town but I thought we might be able to analyze the other participants to see if any thing scummy ended up coming out of it.  <br>\n<br>\nRight now, I'm 99% certain BBT is scum and I'd love to see him hang.

He keeps talking like he knows there is a killing role out there other than scum's factional kill. Him bringing up the vigilante constantly to kill someone regardless of alignment is odd to me. Granted, I understand how he could be annoyed by the fact I said I would hammer, but come on man. I said I was a village idiot, I'm just clowning around. It seems as if he is trying to set himself up for a vigilante claim later in the game, which is another reason he's so out to kill me specifically. I'm being targeted to seem like a vigilante will kill me in the night, when in actuality, a serial killer will be doing it, and then he'll be able to fake claim Vigilante and get away with it. On the flipside, the possibility of him being scum, and hoping for a second kill to potentially get a mislynch is also a possibility.

I have BBT being 90% likely town at this point in the game.  Similarly, I'd put wake at being 80% likely town.  I'm not going to waste my time and energy at this point in the game to speculate about scenarios where I'm required to think that they are, in fact, scum.<br>\n<br>\n2) You said:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>The townread on BBT isn't that well-founded in the first place and <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">your witch-hunting from the BBT wagon is bad at that</div>.</div></blockquote><br>\nThe bolded portion is delightfully overblown nonsense.

(You know, which I would be required to \"witch hunt\" from if one of those hypothetical scenarios I posited -- where both BBT and Csareo are town -- is actually true.)  Ultimately, I feel more like the GreyICE/Omph slot is somehow actually more town (super faint, admittedly, and somewhat based on my speculation about a few things) than massive/Ruffling, so they would be the players I would look more closely at from the Csareo wagon.", "time": "Tue Sep 23, 2014 8:32 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59089&start=1225", "forum": "53", "thread": "59089"}

As Impartial as possible, a player named BBT began vote hopping a lot, and that led to a solid tunnel from a couple of townies, including doogal, boonskies, TTH, and me. In response to the wagon, a second one popped up on yours truly, Csareo, leaving us at a L-2 and L-1 gridlock.

They at first didn't trust each other much, but now BBT thinks TTH is probtown, and TTH mentioned she was having second thoughts about her BBT vote when she was last present in the thread.  They, as neighbors, have a QT.  They have been allowed by the mod to quote from that thread.  They have quoted everything but the first and last posts, which were posted by the mod, because they don't know if that is acceptable.<br>\n<br>\n- wake asks a bunch of questions that repeat themselves (usually tending to deal with the neighborhood mechanic), but the kid's got a good heart and is probtown, so try to look past that failing.<br>\n<br>\n- Csareo asks a bunch of questions that repeat themselves (usually tending to deal with everything under the goddamn sun), usually on the heels of wake's repeated questions.  The jury's out on just how good his heart actually is.<br>\n<br>\n- Flubber doesn't like Anatole, because Anatole apparently goes for \"low hanging fruit\" that may or may not be alignment indicative.<br>\n<br>\n- GreyICE (the first of your slot) threw down a vote on Anatole under the theory that one should Lynch All Liars (tm), on the basis that (1) Anatole had said X was his experience with neighbors, (2) GreyICE found a previous game in which Anatole had played and which neighbors were present, (3) GreyICE asserted that this previous game was actually NOT-X, rather than the supposed X Anatole had claimed.  BBT jumped onto that vote.  Then the thread collectively explained that this previously game actually did stand for X, not NOT-X, and that Anatole hadn't been lying.  GreyICE fled the game.<br>\n<br>\n- Omph (the second of your slot) had a stylish entry post, but then didn't follow through with anything.  I had to explain to him how I conjured up my own entry post, which I think is pretty bullshit since I know nobody read it because it's pointless.<br>\n<br>\n- BBT and Csareo are the dueling wagons.  They both have not awesome personalities that very clearly rub people the wrong way, but we're all refined ladies and gents here, and so we want to hang them for supposedly valid reasons.<br>\n<br>\n- BBT is suspected because allegedly (1) he's a neighbor, (2) he immediately followed GreyICE's readily verifiable-as-wrong vote against Anatole, (3) he changes his vote frequently, (4) his votes are reactionary.  I'm sure others can add to this.<br>\n<br>\n- Csareo is suspected by allegedly (1) buddying wake at a time when wake and Anatole were internet screaming at each other over some pretty minor BS, (2) got super defensive about being called out on buddying, instead of simply saying \"yeah well I agreed with wake so why wouldn't I have said whatever it is I said?\"), (3) supposedly did a scum slip when he said that \"when BBT flips town\" instead of \"if BBT flips town,\" but frankly in the context it made sense to me as BBT had just said that he was going to flip town, (4) he pushed a pretty bad case against BBT in tandem with lining up lynches in the form of BBT-TTH (the neighbors), suggesting an attempted mislynch, (5) he has vilified with those who disagree with his BBT suspicions, which he clearly connected to setting up future vote pushes against such players regardless of whether BBT flips town or scum, (6) he's gone out of his way to defensively answer questions that were not actually posted to him, and (7) he likes to reduce the totality of the suspicions against him as simply \"buddying\" and \"associative tells,\" though one time he said that he was accused of \"tunneling,\" but that's just him getting overexcited about what all suspicion things he's done in this thread.", "time": "Wed Sep 24, 2014 12:57 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59089&start=1300", "forum": "53", "thread": "59089"}

BBT:<br>\n<br>\n(1) voted TTH out of the game because of his neighbor problems, before TTH had actually said anything;<br>\n(2) voted wake in response to wake's wonderfully unhelpful \"I don't read all the posts in the this game, so I'm going to repeat questions about the neighborhood scenario,\" and immediately after wake had voted Anatole, not BBT; and<br>\n(3) voted Csareo after Csareo voted BBT, true, but also after BBT had noted problems with Csareo's play (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6208200#p6208200\">Post 367</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6209092#p6209092\">Post 382</a>), and BBT's vote was the first vote on Csareo at that point (see the immediately posted unofficial vote count in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6209251#p6209251\">Post 386</a>), thereby failing to be much a \"counterwagon\" vote and looking more like frustration with a certain player.<br>\n<br>\n- Reactionary votes speak to town more than scum.  Town know that they are town, and are more prone to suspect others who are going after a player that they know 100% to be town.  Scum know that they are not town, and therefore want to appear more thoughtful about another player's suspicions of them.<br>\n<br>\n- His mode of interaction with accusations that are easily verifiable as wrong (e.g., BBT's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6234234#p6234234\">Post 820</a>'s \"I would guess the scum are on my wagon and trying to push my lynch through before Csareo's,\" followed by Csareo's horrible mangling of what that sentence meant in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6234300#p6234300\">Post 821</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6234309#p6234309\">Post 823</a>, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6234311#p6234311\">Post 824</a>, followed by BBT's exasperated explanation in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6234313#p6234313\">Post 825</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6234359#p6234359\">Post 832</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6234361#p6234361\">Post 834</a>), make me comfortable that this type of exasperated-after-a-certain-point play style is just how BBT plays, rather than being alignment indicative.

For some reason I thought I did which means I wrote something up and then forgot to submit it.  I will give reads on everybody today.<br>\n<br>\n2.  You are not correct that I unvoted BBT in 535.  I unvoted in 391.  I was V/LA on the weekend as always and didn't want to leave my vote out there.  I put it back on BBT after the quickhammer threat was gone.<br>\n(2A:  Jumping on a wagon without doing any research at all on it's validity was scummy as all hell.  Just slightly scummier than making the false allegation to begin with.)<br>\n(2B:  Somewhat related but not answering a specific question, BBT is the best noose candidate because he is anti-town at best [and I'm pretty sure scum].  Also, it will put to rest this whole neighbor thing that we have gone over 15 times and will end up eating up all of day 2.  If he lives it's all going to be @TTH, what did BBT put in the chat over night?  @BBT What did TTH put in the chat?  Nah uh, I don't believe you!!!  I can tell you, if that happens, anybody who still cares will give up and the scum will walk all over this game.)<br>\n3.  It's going to hard to explain the whole AK/Wake situation to someone who wasn't in the middle of it, but the timing of all the posts coming in fast and heavy and a number of others posted in the middle of it commenting on the fight and suddenly, out of nowhere was BBT going let's get a lurker!  It killed the flow and commentary at that point.  It felt random and forced.  I would have preferred a \"@Lurker, what is your take on the current AK vs Wake situation\" vs a \"Let's get him, he's lurking!\"  <br>\n<br>\nSide note, thanks for the post at 1332.  I disagree that the reactionary votes are likely town.  I really think he did everything he could to get a wagon going and the best he could do was the Csareo \"slip\" which I don't think was really a slip.  But, then again, there are 2 easy ways to find out if it was indeed a slip.

I've played with Wake multiple times, and I'm one of the few who actually like playing with Wake, and he seems to always be targeted by scum as a mislynch. Granted, I've never actually seen Wake as scum that I remember. But Wake is definitely one of the people who scum use to make an easy mislynch. He's very proactive and I believe he overthinks things. I don't feel like Wake should be lynched toDay. I always seem to enjoy having a town Wake alive later in the game. <br>\n<br>\nThat being said, I see why people are on him, even if they are town.

I see originally why he would want his supposed neighbor to be possibly lynched, but when things started turning into a \"we lynch one, if they flip town, we lynch the other one\" kind of deal, he backed off. I believe he's probably going to bring this up later, when he would be more okay with being lynch. Afterwards, he sees Anatole vs Wake happening and picks a side. He's directly involved with the two, but he is staying under the radar. This makes me have a potential feeling that BBT is trying for a mislynch on either one of them leading into a second mislynch on the other.

First of all, Mafia's a game of deceit. We don't know who's telling the truth and who isn't the only times we can put utter faith and trust into things in an ongoing game is when things are confirmed by the moderator. So yeah, no, you're not an Inoccent Child last I checked. You didn't die and flip Town, either. So what does that mean? It means that since this is a Close dSetup and we have no template like in Newbie games to be  sure what's what in this game, you're not exempt from questioning.<br>\n<br>\nIf I were you I'd be doing everything I can to answert questions. You as Town should be providing reads, asking people to keep asking you questions and filling in blank spots in the game, and otherwise doing everything you can before you're lynched in order to activate your ability. But you aren't doing that. How much of an effort have you put in these last 24 hours to share updated reads? Or on who you should Venge? Or on anything else in the state of the game?<br>\n<br>\nYou're just sitting there, telling me to look elsewhere, and not doing much. Seriously. And you've even gone so far as to try and threaten me with your supposed Vengeshot and pass it off as some sort of Policy Lynch, as if pissing away these last 92 pages. And I should trust you? I shouldn't inquire of your words and actions, or wonder about what you're not but should be doing? And since when is being curious a bad thing? Nonsense. I get answers by asking questions. It's how I've caught Scum in games past.<br>\n<br>\nPlease paerdon me for not accepting all of your words as 100% honest when you're not confirmed. \"Hey um, DP, is TTH Town?\" ... TTH, he's silent. Titus, is DP silent on TTH's alignment? I don't hear him telling me you're confirmed Town. ...yeah. No. I don't know, so I darn well will question you and hold your feet to the fire until my curiosity is satisfied, and that might never happen. Please stop telling me to look elsewhere. I'm not going to look elsewhere when you try to divert my attention and subvert my train of thought. It's not going to persuade me to take my eyes off of you. You saying I'm contrarian when you darn well may be Scum is the very meaning of hollow, my friend. You want me to stop Scumhunting you. I want answers from you as to why, and I expect you to continue engaging and playing the game instead of Scum-floundering all over the place.", "time": "Sun Sep 28, 2014 8:23 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59089&start=2300", "forum": "53", "thread": "59089"}

And then there's the issue of DP remaining utterly silent when asked for clarification on whether or not Scum can make and post quotes from a PT and pass it off as something entirely different.<br>\n<br>\nIf BBT's actually a Mason, since you're directly asking I would say Rufflig, since he did say he refused to vote for BBT.

If you are in fact town, then the two leading, deadlocked wagons -- which basically defined this game up until Omph was replaced by FG -- were town versus town.  There is a VCA, minus a L-1 and hammer vote, to help you along your analysis.<br>\n<br>\n-----<br>\n<br>\nSpeaking of VCA, and based solely on VCA theory, I'm inclined to believe that one of players not voting Csareo or BBT in the quoted VC is scum (Anatole or Jagged).  Their lack of a position on the two leading wagons, one being definitely town and one probably town, gives them cred for not being on a mislynch, and for rising above a game bitterly divided on which townie to kill.  Also, jumping onto one of the wagons would have brought some seriously harsh attention upon themselves, so they were very much stuck in being prevented from voting either Csareo or BBT.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nStepping away from VCA theory, I think Jagged's play looks town, and his slot looks town because of his predecessor GreyICE's particular actions.  I set forth my reasons for this position in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6250389#p6250389\">Post 1935</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6250509#p6250509\">Post 1946</a>, and I stand by them.  I don't think a Jagged lynch is a good lynch.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nIn contrast, I did not care much for Anatole's ISO.  I will note that I was quite comfortable with his posting as I was experiencing it live.  But on reread, it looks a lot less town:<br>\n- Lots of posts, but they didn't actually contribute much. / Minimal scum hunting while maintaining an active presence.<br>\n- Used GreyICE's single poorly researched vote as his go-to suspicion as thousands (literally) of posts accumulated in the game.<br>\n- But Anatole appeared to agree, before GreyICE decided to escape the game, that GreyICE's bad vote looked actually like mistaken town -- and it was only when GreyICE had clearly retreated from the game that Anatole used the bad vote to his full advantage to label the slot as scum.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI was going to wait until Anatole's response to my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6255003#p6255003\">Post 2325</a> to vote him, but that was because I wasn't going to talk through the problems I had with his play upon the ISO reread until then.

What I mean by believable is that I would expect a tracker in a normal game just like I would expect doc or cop or jailkeeper and such.  Neighbor/Mason isn't what I was expecting.  Vengeful neighbor also wasn't what I was expecting.  As for BBT being 100% instantly verifiable, can you tell me how we can do that without a counter claim and one of them flipping?  Again, I don't think we should kill him today but I don't know that I believe his claim or your claim for that matter.  <br>\n<br>\nAs for the vengeful, can you explain why you thought it was a good idea to sacrifice yourself in order to get a kill when we just can lynch somebody without killing you in the process?  Assuming you aren't lying, we have to mislynch you in order to get a kill.  Again, assuming you aren't lying, I'd much rather have you around contributing, voting and maybe using your ability later on if scum decides to lynch you and you are really sure of who the scum pushing against you are.", "time": "Mon Sep 29, 2014 5:30 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59089&start=2500", "forum": "53", "thread": "59089"}

Why?<br>\n<br>\nShooting GC was a guess. Scum didn't know, so they had to have made an educated guess based on whatever their reads told them. FakeGod said it was very apparent, yet that doesn't mesh with it 'being a guess' that anybody could have guessed at. How long do you reckon TTH will be allowed to go untested?

They would have to kill you tonight, BBT. I personally do not think there would be a Doctor or another protective role in this game... If TTH is also Town, Scum would have to kill you first, and then kill TTH afterwards. I don't think Scum would want to see TTH lynched because there is the possibility she could plug one of them.

Titus' massive vote sucked. It was based solely on setup speculation. Even worse, Titus' setup speculation was not based on what has been claimed about the setup thus far.

Perhaps I'll be pleasantly surprised, but I doubt it.<br>\n<br>\nUnfortunately, I still have the same problem as yesterday. JA was against a Csareo lynch while GC was for it. Net result: no change.

The reason he gave was crap and showed absolutely no thought - if you want to be kind, you could state that Titus was confused about the setup.

There is a large difference in stating that a cop cannot exist in this setup and stating that a tracker cannot exist. This is also crap. Titus can't state that he believes Boonskiies is scum for failing to come up with a result when Titus is pushing forth the idea that there is a mafia roleblocker in the game. All Titus has left to explain his votes is the original setup claims that he was spoon fed yesterday.

Hell of a way to lose a PR but a PR for scum trade is one I'd take.<br>\n<br>\nOnto the VCA.<br>\n<br>\nSome of my analysis depends on me knowing I am town.

If Boonskiies is scum with either one of the two of them, they'd benefit by bussing him.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAt 1.20 We see a Jagged Alliance wagon pop-up on town just as the BBT wagon is collapsing. Scum would benefit more by having just a lurker lynch on Boonskiies if he was town. Yet we see a counterwagon on Jagged.<br>\n<br>\nThe two votes on TTH are by confirmed town at this point.<br>\n<br>\nThen there's some interesting wagon motion going on. Csareo leaves the TTH wagon to vote confirmed town. I sub in and pick the wrong choice out of TTH and Jagged Appliance. I should have seen the votepark sooner.

I contributed a lot to this game in the past with hyper-analytical/large posts, yet I feel they don't get read or absorbed. So, I don't know what to do, and in spite of feeling a bit miffed that Town doesn't seem to care what I feel or think on the matter, I'm not willing to replace out of this game. That said, I have 8 interviews, 95 hours of work, and over 600 miles to drive this week. And a mother without insurance who may be coming down with fallopian cancer like her mother and four other sisters. Yeah. Part of the reason why I have very little time. I'm bitching a bit. Please forgive that.<br>\n<br>\nSo I keep wanting to respond to certain posts, and then I either forget or get preoccupied. Titus mentioned something about a gambit but I don't know if she meant me or Boonskiies, or what she even meant. Haven't been able to get a good read on her. I do not trust FG because he's refusing to engage me directly, and his latest flurry of very fast posts gives me reason to pause and think. BBT is Town unless DP did something to screw with us, but I feel he doesn't care for what I have to say. Haven't found time to read massive's, Doogal's, and others' posts. <br>\n<br>\nOddly enough, I don't like how nobody's voting or Scumreading me. Hey, I'm just being honest here. Usually as Town (while being pro-Town) I get at least one or two votes on me which I brush off while dishing out content. The fact that there's no votes and really not all that much suspicion shoved towards me sorta makes me nervous. The reason I pester FakeGod for saying I'm a solid town read so damned early on is because he could be trying to placate me, and then change it really quickly later on. I think that happened to me at least once or twice over the years. <br>\n<br>\nRight now I'm chugging 3 cups of coffee just to summon the energy to type this up. Frankly it's working and I'm starting to feel better, like I've got some life energy in me (please note that I have ADD and can be incredibly disorganized at times). Back to BBT, he seems to have missed both times where I wondered about him saying he will not get killed tonight. I feel like I should have some sort of answer there, because I don't understand it. I don't want to piss players off, but I don't think it's the right the to let unanswered things go down the road. <br>\n<br>\nAnyways, I'm going to post this bit so far and chug another mug of coffee. If I have to consume lots of caffeine just to get on top of this game then I guess I'll have to do that.", "time": "Wed Oct 08, 2014 7:29 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59089&start=2850", "forum": "53", "thread": "59089"}

{"number": 2952, "id": "6283861", "user": "Doogal121", "user_id": "24043", "content": "My case against TTH, in book form.<br>\n<br>\nI&#8217;m guessing what bugs me is that she claimed vengeful.  Vengeful is something you should never claim as either town or scum.  As FG suggested, as Mafia she could have done a day 2 gambit, claimed cop and done real damage.  As town, she should have stayed quiet, waited to Mylo and then nailed the hammerer.  Since she did neither of those, we have to assume she didn&#8217;t play it optimally, regardless of her alignment.  Now, I have 2 reasons I want to lynch her.  1, she is scum.  2, we can win the game if she flips scum.<br>\n<br>\nEvidence for the first point.  1.  I still think her earlier post (quoted below so there is no misrepresention) didn&#8217;t make sense in the neighbor flow and was probably a scum slip and would make more sense in the scum PT flow.   2.  She is a bit of a lurker, hasn&#8217;t really put too much out there pushing wise and is sheeping a little.   In fact, she&#8217;s barely been here day 2.  My guess is the scum PT is going to be a great deal of &#8220;pls don&#8217;t talk anymore&#8221; posts to TTH.  3.  She was behind that awful vengeful gambit day one to try to get to use her power.  Nobody, not anybody, has told me why they thought that was a good idea yet.  Vengeful is an anti-town ability and to suggest losing a townie to get scum maybe is just dumb beyond belief.  Feels more like scum wanting to seem important than town trying to win.  <br>\n<br>\nNow, the associative reads part (all of this assumes she flips scum).  1.  We have a hard confirm of Wake as town as the topic of the below reference PT post.  We have a soft confirm of the following, (AK, Myself, Massive).  If you include broken toaster in the mix, these are all people she was trying to venge.  She also voted Boons at one point.  So, her flipping scum gives associative town reads to AK/Myself/Wake/Massive/Boons.  That should be enough that we can lynch everybody else and still be ahead.  I&#8217;m assuming there are 2 more scum in this game, of the remaining, I would say, in likelhood from most to least scummiest is Fakegod/Rufflig/Flubber/Titus.  She was hard sheeping Fakegod toward the end, especially with the &#8220;If you say JA is scum, then I&#8217;ll vote&#8221;.  It&#8217;s almost like a new scum player begging for help from an experienced scum buddy.  <br>\n<br>\n@Everybody, where am I wrong?<br>\n<br>\nPS @TTH, I volunteer to be vengekilled for putting this forward.

I'm <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">convinced</div> that there has to be something to that.  From the VCA analysis, I also know that was an all-town wagon so now I'm trying to dissect what went wrong with the Anatole wagon and how it fell.  The only reasonable conclusion I can come to is that it fell with the death of Green Crayons.  GC wasn't outed as a mason at that point so kill must have been strategically chosen for this purpose; a purpose that was pretty well fulfilled by the kill.<br>\n<br>\nThere's also the question of Boonskiies.  I don't feel like his \"no result\" claim was really ever ironed out and with the amount of Rube Goldberg-esque theories about me being scum (and former theories about BBT being scum), I don't know why Boonskiies' claim is being so readily accepted at face value.  By the way, Boonskiies is another person not voting and sitting on the sidelines while this Rufflig vs. FakeGod shouting match is playing out (see: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6285742#p6285742\" class=\"postlink\">Post 2985</a>).", "time": "Fri Oct 10, 2014 5:56 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59089&start=3000", "forum": "53", "thread": "59089"}

Indeed BBT claimed Mason, and GC dies as one. Barring some nefarious plot at the hands of DP and his evil NRG minions, I highly doubt BBT isn't Town. That said, he did say something odd. Odd in that it isn't explained. A mystery. A question. Blood in the water. Chum. Something to pursue, and with good reason. What did he say, AK? He says he will not die tonight. Night 2. Scum like killing Masons. BBT's a Mason, and one whose buttocks are exposed in the field. Forgive me for wondering, but shouldn't I question this? That BBT's a Mason is not in question at the moment. His newfound declaration of temporary immortality <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">is</div>. So looking at the field and all the wily characters in it, my eyes settle on TellTaleHeart.

A <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">possibility</div>. Is that she's the latent reason BBT says his clock won't be cleaned tonight. Why else would he declare himself indestructible tonight, unless it's some grand bluff?

I can probably do a quick ISO because I remember someone saying how quick he jumped off Boons with the tracker claim.<br>\n<br>\n37 votes BBT on the neighborhood out. 42 \"at least one scum in the neighborhood.\"  75 claims bad at early scumreads, good at early townreads, has none. ISO 21-26 tries to disperse the TTH \"scumslip\" from her neighbor thread. So far his D1 ISO reads like someone who is looking for town and not scum. 213 has townreads on TTH and Doogal, which is consistent with his defense of TTH -- but that post also looks a little weird since he refuses to scumread Wake or BBT despite disliking their gameplay. If TTH is town and worth defending, doesn't that make BBT at least sorta scummy? 216 says that it's low likelihood that either BBT and TTH are scum, and this seems like a weird thing to hang out there, since everyone else was sure at least one of them was scum, and the rest of us weren't anywhere near confident enough to state something like that. 231 starts interacting with Wake which I think could cause read confusion, because how can you scumread someone for telling Wake how bananas some of his theories are? Frustration and the ultimate vote in 297 feels real. 346 is back to saying he was one of the early people saying there was likely scum in the neighborhood. 586 back to BBT town. 1080 back to \"at least one scum in the neighborhood.\" 1100 townreads are BBT, Doogal, GC, Csareo. Where did TTH go and how is he the ONLY person who doesn't pick sides in BBT v Csareo? (Both town, 1083) <br>\n<br>\n1463 is where the Boons stuff starts. Claims Boons is a good lynch here. Unmoved by the PR softclaim (1537 says he believes Boons is lying) but the tracker fullclaim elicits an unvote (1621). But makes further references to disbelieving Boons' claim (like 2498, 2754) 2846 says Boons is his only scumread but is nowhere near voting for him. Still making reference to Boons despite voting for TTH. (3152. 3158) <br>\n<br>\nTTH Day 2 vote. Unvotes and votes Wake (?), then back to TTH. <br>\n<br>\nToday he says he wants attention on Boons, Wake, and Titus, but votes himself. <br>\n<br>\nHow has he never gone back and voted Boons after the initial claim wagon? He certainly has consistently said he disbelieves his claim, and is still listing him as likely scum.<br>\n<br>\nSorry, it's late and that got long, I know I should link it up but you can pull up his ISO and read along.", "time": "Thu Oct 16, 2014 6:04 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59089&start=3625", "forum": "53", "thread": "59089"}

This was started at first because I honestly felt that I'd be SUPER likely to lynch Boon in early days, and I figured I'd feel better about any links back to him if I just simply had no idea what he was thinking or where he was going. As the game went on, it became something of an experiment for me, and it didn't seem to impact the actual gameplay of our team. I could honestly say \"I wouldn't have killed Green Crayons, he was obviously the other mason\" so it felt like, to me, it actually gave me an extra layer of faux-credibility.
