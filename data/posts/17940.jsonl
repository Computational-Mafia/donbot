He didn't vote/unvote at L-2/L-1, so Emp was never at L-1. He was at L-3 at the time of Mal's post, which is why I pointed out that it was weird that mal felt the need to vote/unvote Emp in the same post with the incorrect reasoning that he didn't want him to be at L-1. As with my first vote of Empking I was building early wagons to fuck around and draw out reactions from people. <br>\n<br>\nAgain, dumb or inexperienced thinking that by saying \"A vote can be for reaction\" I mean \"I want to see how X reacts when I vote for him\" as opposed to \"I want to see how all players react when I vote for X\".

The tacking on the end of 'L-2 is not that dangerous' isn't completely true, it totally depends upon the wagons steam, how good the evidence against someone is and generally how aggressive the people pushing it are. <br>\n<br>\nI don't like Malp's reason of asking for the vote to removed, simply because that reason was not followed up and jumping to say 'well i was reaction fishing' seems a little defensive and it completely underminds the reason. If you make scum aware of what you're doing, they're likely going to avoid it like the plague or use it in a way to look good. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, at this point in time i find Bristeps posts to be aggressive, i've seen him play like this as town and thus he's leaning town to me, so I don't think the wagon (at least in the beginning) is / was scum motivated - which in general makes me feel happier with it. <br>\n<br>\nI'm not willing to take this to L-1 just yet, I don't want the possibility of a self hammer since the thread has been quite quiet and we don't have much more going on:<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Malp</span>", "time": "Thu Jul 07, 2011 7:14 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17940&start=125", "forum": "53", "thread": "17940"}

Hence the point of alts, you're trying to play under a less recognizable name so that you can play radically different. Which is probably why he's all lulzy and weird with his avatar and whatnot, he's trying to experiment with being a different person. <br>\n<br>\nUnless perchance he is cheating, Rikana isn't another person in this game at the same time. And although he may have thought my next question was \"tell me whose alt you are\" (I might be wrong), my next question was \"are you Town?\" and he said \"no\".

That isn't a definite D1 scumtell on it's own, and while his last \"I have nothing to say\" post isn't good town play it isn't exactly good scum play either.

{"number": 255, "id": "3256994", "user": "FightingShadow", "user_id": "16218", "content": "JAMFTW - what does your username mean?<br>\n<br>\nAnyways, my thoughts on Day 1:<br>\n<br>\nI apologize for being absent.  By the time I checked the thread again, the day was over.  The three people that jumped out at me for Day 1 were smallpeoples, Internet Stranger, and Rikana.  Smallpeoples for the terrible lurking (hypocritical, I know).<br>\n<br>\nInternet Stranger's tunnelling I didn't like at all.  He basically tunnelled on Malp.  Throughout the day I mainly saw from him posts about Malpascp being scummy, posts criticizing the game's lack of content, or planning for future days based on what Malp's alignment was.  He had more criticism about the thread than he did attempts to improve the thread . . . which seems like a spot that lazy scum would try to stay in.  Gives the appearance of caring about how the game is dying, but not really helping its condition at all.  Not to mention helping to muscle through a town lynch.<br>\n<br>\nAs for Rikana, I don't like how he consistently called Malp town, but didn't make much of an effort to try to derail the wagon.  As the game neared deadline, that became less scummy, and in his first couple of posts, he did.  But for the majority of day one, it seemed like all he did was say \"map town, bristep scum\" and then got out of the way.  No real sense of urgency to try to turn his opinions into flips.  And a scum who wanted to get credit for calling Malp town wouldn't neccessarily want to stop Malp from being lynched.  <br>\n<br>\nAlright, now for Day 2:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Internet Stranger wrote:</cite>LYNCHED (Internet stranger, JAMFTW, Bristep123, Empking, Sky, Swiftstrike, Smallpeople343)<br>\n<br>\nSo like I said, at least one of these people is scum. Obviously, its neither me or Bristep. I nominate JAM<br>\n<br>\nVote: JAMFTW</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nGiven what I said above about IS, this bothers me.  Strongarm the lynch, and then immediately suspect everyone who went along with it?  You clearly aren't above suspicion here, and I find your rush to move on to the next suspect suspicious.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>yabbaguy wrote:</cite>Vote: Internet Stranger for illogical and reckless wagon push. I don't approve, JAM was not a lurker, he was inactive.<br>\n<br>\nI also think IS is pointing out the lurking for Townpoints, but actually isn't and wasn't doing a hell of a lot to actively solve that problem. Just idly \"stop doing it\" \"I'll wait\" \"Not my problem, waiting for the dust to settle\"<br>\n<br>\nStuff along those lines.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nyabbaguy knows what's up.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>JAMFTW wrote:</cite>Rather odd, given the fact that he had an earlier post, so I don't think he's been silenced.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYou play EM, alright.

However, I don't get a town-vibe from IS's tunnelling thus far.

I had hoped my internet would be up much quicker than it was, the reason my posts slowed up before finally the v/la is because i was leeching internet across the road, the connection there got quite bad to the point of being unable to connect most of the time and my only real access to the net from then was walking to another street with my partners macbook which i did once or twice to prod dodge / say i'll be back soon. This was the reason i didn't place a vote onto Malp I had put an FoS in place i didn't want to take it to L-1 real early and by the time i got back to this game again the day had ended. <br>\n<br>\nThe inactivity has left me sort of treading water, both in my reads and post content - something which will shorlty be rectified.<br>\n<br>\nAs for my suspicions: I had been a little suspious of FS, this is why i asked about his dropping of Empking as one of his scum reads, it seemed a little odd, he's explained it fairly well and so that has cleared it up mostly for me.

Hell Yabba, you KNEW that my plan was to go after the hanger-on scum if he flipped townie. So now you want to play the White Knight and flip this on me? Dont you see that what youre trying to pull is a scum-classic technique?<br>\n<br>\nYou werent very happy when I called out JAM, hell your panties were scrunched up more than his.

Im trying to figure out if Rikana or Shadow are scum, or misguided townies, but im not sure yet, seems kinda early in the wagon. Whoever plunked my next vote was likely going to be a third scum, but I figured I point this out now anyways since I know whats coming.<br>\n<br>\nEither way, im happy with taking JAM out of the picture.

My aims were to obviously do the usual scum thing whilst trying to find the town IC member - if i hit the oppisite sides scum IC it would have been bad the info the town ic would give out would suck for my team. This was a really great role because i felt like i was in a fairly unique situation the other IC scum was the other teams godfather (which i had some suspicion of thanks to my scum buddy) and so i was the only one who could safely make a night kill on the town ic. <br>\nOther than that, I tend to like the VT role, on the site i play i always end up eating a night kill and so it's about the best role i can be there to be pro-town  I've not yet had a third party role, which i believe i'd also love to play.</fieldset><br>\n<br>\nSo he's still wallowing in RQS but not seemingly retrieving any useful information.<br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\">I asked the random questions a while ago, i wouldn't say they've killed the game though - the only thing that was truly going on has still been going on along side them</fieldset><br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\">I answered the question as the guy who posted the questions, if you'd like to disregard my answer and wait for swift to give you the exact same one be my guest.</fieldset><br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\">well, in the first post you feel that your vote means 'something' why is it before that you said what's going on is 'not much'.<br>\n<br>\nI actaully agree that asking people to remove their votes is a <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">wee bit scummy</div>, but it's not necessarily a scum tell but the fact that you made that post and then made the case that it's 'not much' later seems a wee bit scummy too.

I'm not really sure what there is to latch on to at the moment. Rikana's response to Bristep is something that will be interesting to see but how much substance there is in the whole argument i'm unsure, still though some of the reactions seem a wee bit odd. One thing I don't usually like however is people asking for votes to be removed, especially so early in the game where the chance of being hammered is low to say the least, over defensiveness never does anything to help me trust somebody.</fieldset><br>\n<br>\n\"interesting\" \"not really sure\".

If you make scum aware of what you're doing, they're likely going to avoid it like the plague or use it in a way to look good. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, at this point in time i find Bristeps posts to be aggressive, i've seen him play like this as town and thus he's leaning town to me, so I don't think the wagon (at least in the beginning) is / was scum motivated - which in general makes me feel happier with it. <br>\n<br>\nI'm not willing to take this to L-1 just yet, I don't want the possibility of a self hammer since the thread has been quite quiet and we don't have much more going on:<br>\n<br>\nFoS malp</fieldset><br>\n<br>\nIt's just too long.

I actually find because of that scenario that my read on Rikana is leaning town. <br>\n<br>\nWhy is it that you find it to be so suspect? <br>\n<br>\nThe one thing about Rikana's posts there is that they're quite conclusive, leave no room for backing out of the opinions easily.</fieldset><br>\n<br>\nTOO. SLOW. TOO.

It seemed day 1 you had a bit of a hardon for him and he's not been mentioned in this most recent post. Just wondering what your thought s on him are now.</fieldset><br>\n<br>\nunsure unsure sorta suspect unsure.

I'm still not caught up as much as i'd like and would like the chance to go through some ISO's and fully develop reads before showing a commitment to something just because others seem in some cases fairly certain. I'd also like to hear more from FS because he hasn't had a lot of posts for me to read back on and Emp seemed to be his previous scum read who he has now not mentioned, trying to work out if his motives for the case against IS that he presented are clear would be quite a big thing with my reads.</fieldset><br>\n<br>\nNah.<br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\">What I'd say for you is to look at the other game i'm in (Newbie 1117) the inactive periods here will match up there, including the time i hadn't posted my V/LA. I had hoped my internet would be up much quicker than it was, the reason my posts slowed up before finally the v/la is because i was leeching internet across the road, the connection there got quite bad to the point of being unable to connect most of the time and my only real access to the net from then was walking to another street with my partners macbook which i did once or twice to prod dodge / say i'll be back soon. This was the reason i didn't place a vote onto Malp I had put an FoS in place i didn't want to take it to L-1 real early and by the time i got back to this game again the day had ended. <br>\n<br>\nThe inactivity has left me sort of treading water, both in my reads and post content - something which will shorlty be rectified.<br>\n<br>\nAs for my suspicions: I had been a little suspious of FS, this is why i asked about his dropping of Empking as one of his scum reads, it seemed a little odd, he's explained it fairly well and so that has cleared it up mostly for me. IS seems to be the most likely candidate to me: I find myself trusting 2 of the people on the wagon, I find that his commenting on lack of content yet adding little is as detrimental to town as lurkers yet also putting himself out there in good light, if FS seems oppertunistic to him, that seems oppertunistic to me. <br>\n<br>\nVOTE: Internet Stranger</fieldset><br>\n<br>\nSo now the IS vote comes down at long last - took him 4 days. The inactive periods did NOT match though, you had the ability to come to this game and you didn't. You just didn't want to play this game for some reason.<br>\n<br>\nIt's been SUCH a problem throughout the whole game.

Other people were trying to get the game going in a direction that might actually find scum. You can say it wasn't having much effect, in your opinion, but you can't deny that people had moved away from RVS and were voting and making genuine accusations. You did nothing - and I mean nothing - to try to continue that. You didn't even acknowledge that. Even after that initial RQS post, when there was an interchange of more substance between Rikana and Bristep, you don't address that at all. The contrast between you and other players who didn't offer much on D1 is that you were still posting content - it just seemed to have very little to do with the actual point of the game. When I see a lot of words and no scumhunting, I think scum. <br>\n<br>\nSo is it normal for you to spend several days at the start of the game without putting any effort into finding scum? Is it normal for you to ignore the interactions between other players? What do you think you got out of RQS that helped you to scumhunt, and why did you prefer that to analysing the existing arguments in the game? Why do you think I'm scum when all I seem to have done is some fairly accurate analysis of your D1 play?

You hadn't even incorporated the argument about me being wishy-washy day 2, it just seemed a little bare bones, I felt that you (as others have done admittedly) had made an assumption about motives for something which i had done in a pro-town way which paint it as scum.

Is that a bad technique? No. Is it hypocritical to the max? YES. AND IT'S INFURIATING.<br>\n<br>\nLet's look at something else that's beautiful.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>IS wrote:</cite>I absolutely hate this post of peoples, this is ugly. But it reads more of a bored townie than it does of a lurker scum, for now at least.</div></blockquote>This is in reference to Small's post about going prod dodging, without saying /proddodge.<br>\n<br>\nHey! This looks familiar!<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Internet Stranger wrote:</cite>Why is this game filled with so much garbage?

Even if it includes everyone, IS could know Malp's alignment. Not even that, it's shitty logic at best. <br>\n<br>\nLet's move a bit forward to one of IS' later posts.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>IS wrote:</cite>Rikana wants EVERYONE dead, apparently.</div></blockquote>Considering that I labeled 4 people(Peregrine, IS, BU, PeregrineV), no I didn't. Let's see how many people IS wants dead though!<br>\n<br>\nMalp was wanted, JAM, Random(now two dead on his list. Better reputation than me!), Yabba. That's 4. We're equal. And I'm completely sure, even though you haven't said it, that Empking will be your target later. Of course, I have no proof of that. I'm pretty sure everyone knows this by now though.<br>\n<br>\nContinuing with lack of content, IS is, as usual, hypocritical in the fact that he barely gives any real concrete content with his reasoning. For all we know, IS could be bullshitting everything he's said. Am I going to check everything? No. It's way too late, hot and I'm too annoyed to do that already. <br>\n<br>\nso,<br>\n<br>\nwhy is this scumbag seen as town again?<br>\n<br>\nI'll make a separate post for PeregrineV.", "time": "Mon Jul 25, 2011 1:44 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17940&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "17940"}

I really don't want to believe that is the inspiration for the claim - it also doesn't mention the mechanics of the role there, he'd have had to read that post, look the role up on the wiki come back here and claim it (assuming he didn't know the jailkeeper role). If he did know the role, it could have served as a reminder but 5 minutes to have viewed that (assuming he read it the moment it was posted) and then post is still quite quick. I'm not by any means saying i believe his claim, I don't - the fact he didn't mention the action of night 1 (which could well help to give us information on a townie or at least eliminate someone from being yesterdays killer) with the claim is odd, especially given IS had told him he had just ONE post to explain himself well or he'd hammer. <br>\n<br>\nAlso:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Jam wrote:</cite><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I'll do what I can tonight to lessen the damage I've caused. </div><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">I doubt I'll be able to pull this around in time, but here's hoping I can help out during the next day.</div><br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThe bolded sounded like it was going to be a doctor / jailkeeper claim (lessen the damage = Stop someone getting killed?) However, the latter part 'I doubt i'll be able to pull this around in time' doesn't really make sense, It could refer to the possibility he could protect someone there would be no kill and he'd be able to say 'X was who i targetted' which leaves a 50/50 of that person being scum / town. I initially read this soft claim to be about a cop however via the sound of it, the last bit seemed to heavily suggest a possibility of him finding scum but thinking back, as a whole the wording fits more with what he is now claiming. <br>\n<br>\nI honestly don't understand his soft claiming at all, if town he made himself a possible target for the night phase, if this had happened he would have been unable to get us ANY information the next day, not from the previous night, not from that night. I mean it was extremely unlikely he would have been hit prior to his soft claim, the scum (if he was town) could easily steer a mislynch at him the next day and he'd have had very easy passage to have at least get the town 2 night results before his lynch day  3. The thing is it's painted almost as though regardless of a very obvious soft claim he was still unlikely to be killed - it's an out for not getting killed that night phase come the next day but from a town point of view it makes NO sense after the soft claim.", "time": "Wed Jul 27, 2011 9:07 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17940&start=450", "forum": "53", "thread": "17940"}

Maybe scum thought it was indicative of a PR, perhaps they killed him simply because his involvement has been low and there's not a lot for the town to make out of it.

I'm going to point out the worst post in relation to the JAM lynch and break it down:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Sky wrote:</cite>The one thing that I don't like about this mislynch is the fact SRG didn't know he wasn't headed toward the gallows. I mean, I think if I were actively playing I'd know just how far away I was to getting killed. But then again, he isn't that active, and he's really been contributing now. Plus I love his use of \"hella\" which for those who don't know, means he's a Nor Calian, and we gotta stick together.<br>\n<br>\nOf the people on the hammer, I find Locke townish. Just a feel. yabba is extremely town, but somehow too much so. Gut read would say scum but I have nothing much to go off on other than intuition. Emp, I find scum. IS hard to say. Not town. Neutral. And lastly JAM... well here goes.<br>\n<br>\nThe hammer is obviously scummy. And obvious enough for scum to actually do it since this a crucial point in the game. Meaning, JAM is the sacrificial kinda scum that would be worth it since if SRG went through, scum would have an upper hand. Guessing at the amount of scum there are of course. So it is scummy, no matter how obvious it looks. I've found JAM to be hazy this game, definitely not town.  So JAM looks a lot better than the SRG lynch so there you have it. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote, Vote: JAMFTW</div></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nSo here are the scummy things about this post:<br>\n<br>\n1. He goes out of his way to provide some crappy reasons why SRG still shouldn't be the lynch. Up to this point he's basically said nothing about SRG other than that he hasn't really got a read on him. Now he apparently feels the need to justify the switch to JAM based on SRG's towniness as well as JAM's scumminess. And just what does he mean by 'mislynch' here anyway?<br>\n<br>\n2. His reasons for his reads on the other players. Oh yeah. There aren't any. He goes through Yabba, Emp, IS and myself without giving a single reason for the reads other than 'gut'.<br>\n<br>\n3. The terrible over-justification of why the hammer is scummy in the third paragraph. It almost reads as though he's trying to convince himself it's true. 'Guessing at the amount of scum there are of course' is such an unnecessary inclusion for anyone who's not paranoid about looking like they actually know how many scum there are, and he seems to be self-aware of how much he's over-simplifying the situation when he says 'So it is scummy, no matter how obvious it looks'. He might as well just have written 'I'm going to go for the easy mislynch to avoid doing any proper analysis'. It would have saved a lot of words.<br>\n<br>\n4. The way he tries to make it sound like he'd have been happy to lynch JAM for some time. Know how many times he's indicated any doubts over JAM's slot up to this point? I can quote them. It won't take long.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Sky wrote:</cite>I do find it suspicious that JAM keeps calling out IS yet makes no move to vote for him.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYep, that's it. So I can see how he might be able to justify 'hazy', given Sky's lack of strong read, but 'definitely not town' is a stretch, and unquestioningly treating him as the obvious lynch is nonsensical. <br>\n<br>\nAll in all, it's forced, over-justified and reeks of struggling to fabricate reads on players.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Sky</div><br>\n<br>\nDiscuss.", "time": "Mon Aug 01, 2011 9:12 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17940&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "17940"}

I hadn't been paying much attention to the SRG wagon. It didn't interest me, its ideas were flawed. <br>\n2. You want reasons for those players? Well for you, I think you're leaning town because you are original. You joined the SRG wagon, sure, but I believe you had different reasons than just quickly hopping onto it as scum. You also have pulled me up-- despite it being me--and that's original too. IS I have come to realize is more leaning town. I wasn't sure yesterday, but towards the end he did have the balls to hammer and it seems that his actions have got the town in mind. He also suspected JAM earlier. yabbaguy is town, despite my gut but I know that doesn't mean shit. He constantly contributes fresh thought, much like you, only does it more often, which is even better. I explained my logic for Emp being scum and it was off. I felt he was just actively lurking and coasting through this entire game. I was wrong.<br>\n3. I'm a stream of conscious guy. It's the way I write. I can tell you're into the whole brevity thing man, that's cool. I know I got pretty short towards the end of yesterday but that's because I was dead set on JAM being scum for hammer. Furthermore, (and I know this is just the way my brain is, its a poor excuse, you can believe it or not) I suck at math and yabbaguy explained it hell of a lot better than I did. You know, with those numbers and what not. Damn yabbaguy, you are a math wizard!<br>\n4. I don't know where I implied that. I do not agree.<br>\n<br>\nRikana, may you please explain that quote and its relevance right now?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n1. What you actually said prior to making that statement on SRG was:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Sky wrote:</cite>I'm trying to make sense of this slot thing, and I need to review SRG because I haven't spent much time there. One more question for Rikana, why were you so intent on carrying out the \"legacy\" of Bristep after you found him suspicious yesterday?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nSo you obviously didn't even know what the reasons for the SRG wagon were. How could you find them flawed?<br>\n<br>\n2. No, I don't want reasons for the players based on what you've seen since. In that post you stated 4 reads and no reasons. You said your town read on me was 'just a feel', so if you actually thought I was town based on originality, why not say that? Your IS and Yabba reads have changed since that post anyway, so providing reasoning for them now is irrelevant, and Emp's the only one who you actually had anything solid on at all. I think in both this response and the previous one, you're making up reasons that were simply not true at the time you made that post.<br>\n<br>\n3. I understand what you're saying in that paragraph. It's got nothing to do with brevity (and I'm really not that brief a poster relative to the likes of IS and Emp). The point is, it reads like you're talking yourself into why scum would have hammered (or attempted to hammer) in that situation, and pre-emptively finding reasons to dismiss arguments that say 'wait a minute, wouldn't it be pretty stupid for JAM-scum to hammer there?'. My sense is you're aware it's an easy vote based on a careless piece of play, and you're trying too hard to justify it as scum play. <br>\n<br>\n4. You framed the post in such a way that it was SRG vs JAM, and JAM was suddenly an obvious lynch despite the fact you'd indicated no real desire to lynch him prior to that. I think that was unrepresentative, both of the state of the game at the time and of your personal stated suspicions. If it was 24 hours to deadline and they were both at L-2, for example, that post would have made sense. You prematurely indicated that you almost had no choice but to vote for JAM, and that your reads on the two players were far more confident than you'd previously stated.", "time": "Tue Aug 02, 2011 6:55 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17940&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "17940"}

I made an error in not saying that the orange corresponded to the \"I'm not sure - but they're probably scum\" side of it. As to the \"charge\" of me saying that I was declaring obvTown, why should I rush it? I lost a Newbie game because I said \"I've called one SUPER-DUPER-OBVIOUS Town, I'll just blast the other two and the other scum will drop\". Oops, the towniest one was the scum. Realizing that I'm scumhunting worse than a random monkey all over again, I won't scream as loudly as I did last Day. (It's the newbie game with Paws and foilist, I forget which #, check the yGDB if you'd like - but I can link the incident when I get home) That's why even though I say \"oh yeah, of course he's Town, I still don't follow it\". This is why I decided not to vote. And besides that, a vote also is a game mechanic that declares interest in ending the Day, and I didn't want the Day to end seeing as I really wasn't sure. It's actually mental uncertainty, it's like \"I just know he's Town, I just have that feeling\". Peregrine and Rikana I still believe to be obvTown, IS and SRG are the ones I expressed doubts about.<br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\">Internet Stranger - As much as I went to fencesit, I just know that he's Town. Why would he start, arguably, the first major squabble of the game when nothing was going on if he was scum? Also, inkling that he's telling the truth and that he wouldn't have let Empking be the kill.</fieldset><br>\n<br>\nI mean, this is me wanting to be unsure, and then I decide to commit to a stance just thinking that's true. But I want to see what others think. There is NO CRIME for wanting to seek a second opinion. If anything, I'm being charged for wanting to be the leading opinion.<br>\n<br>\nSecondly is that I did this thinking that it would make myself LESS intrusive to the game. I mean, this was me having screamed at the top of my lungs for a JAM lynch and having it fail. Therefore, what I wanted to do was <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">non-intrusively</div> state what I felt and then start the debate from there. Where was I taking the lead? I was taking a more passive role, this ISN'T me ringleading until Swift lies to my face, so to speak. What is so wrong with a Day where everyone just talks before they vote, presuming everyone actually gets involved (nope)? I take firm stances, but I expect Town to disagree with me.<br>\n<br>\nThen Swift lies and I immediately discard the strategy of being passive. Yup.<br>\n<br>\nAgain, am I too aggressive or am I too passive? On one hand, you're saying I'm squawking too much and saying \"hey guys, let's mislynch this guy wheeeeee\" or am I being too passive and should be taking more decisive action with my vote?<br>\n<br>\nWhat makes this list say \"YOU GUYS SHOULD DO THIS TOO\"? It's not my fault that you guys are abysmal at being more outright with your opinions. There is NOTHING wrong with just stating a player-by-player and allowing the dialogue to go towards \"what do you think?\" more than \"DO THIS DO THIS\". I did not do any direct action, hence it's \"what do you think?\". I was being open, I was trying to contribute to a Town game. What is the proper Town thing to do in this stance, <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">was I supposed to vote? Then I'm accused of ringleading the Town and it becomes \"nice try yabb, trying to mislynch Townies again?\" What is the proper Town play there?</div><br>\n<br>\nThis is an impossible case. The proper Town play was to sit back, state a few stances, and see where the conversation went. I adamantly assert that it is Town motivated. What is scummy?

But I never did actually vote him, so I think it's not that bad.  But, I realize it's a shitty defense.<br>\n2. I didn't say it at first because I wasn't sure myself. I thought your post on SRG was more original, but you had, and still have, hardly posted in this game. I can say it more so now since you've got a good case, even though it's wrong. But if you believe what I said above, which you probably don't, I didn't want to say you were creative because I wasn't sure.  It was a feeling based off a small post of imagination, since it was virtually your only post of yesterday. <br>\n3.

Would you rather have had me sit idly and not take a side while other players drift past the deadline, even you're among that list. <br>\n<br>\nI'm going to look at this Swift yabba debate going on tomorrow, it's too much too wrap my head around right now.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nSo basically you're admitting that I'm more or less right about everything I've said, including the fact that two of your responses to my original case weren't genuine at all. As for it 'not being that bad' that you made up a reason for not being interested in the SRG case, yes, it is that bad. There's no other motivation for that other than trying to pad out your reasoning by claiming opinions you never had. <br>\n<br>\nAs for saying things you're not sure of, you just told me that you were actually writing that post out partly to convince yourself that you were doing the right thing, so that's just plain hypocritical. Your play indicates that you would have no problem saying 'I get a town feel from Locke because his post shows originality, but I'm not sure as the slot has contributed very little'. So I don't see the issue with saying that over what you claimed at the time was essentially a gut read, which requires no effort to justify and can easily be rescinded later. <br>\n<br>\nCan I also ask why you were so sure of the false hammer? What was it that made you sure it was scum strategy and not clumsy town play?<br>\n<br>\nYabba: I see where you're coming from, but I think Swiftstrike basically just had a point that he wasn't articulating very well. Do you often see scum make a point and then immediately change the meaning of it?

I think I'm going on severely speculative scumtells (such as him posting V/LA in another game and not here) that don't mean a single thing here, so with that I'd like to <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote</div> at this time.<br>\n<br>\nand <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Locke Lamora</div><br>\n<br>\n* Ever since his Sky case collapsed due to the claim, LoLa has done not a whole lot of productive stuff (and while it's null moreso - that vote is pointless and stupid). He was simply inactive in the gap between the 3rd and the 6th, mind you, but when he came back, he's sort of flung a lazy suspicion onto SRG. I'm not sure what this attempts to accomplish.<br>\n* I'm looking back at what smallpeoples said when he opted out, and I'm realizing where I may have called it uberTown by accident. He mentions \"despite the fact that some didn't care\" more in the sense of the fact that some players generally were of the opinion that he wasn't doing much wrong. Take for example Bristep, who I believe said \"that's not really a fo sho scumtell, is it?\" I think here he references moreso the fact that players were saying \"lurking's more anti-Town than scummy\". That's why I'm reversing back on this stupid Towntell I had, and it's interesting how LoLa veered out of his way to persuade me another one was wrong.<br>\n* With that out of the way, I think the fact that smallpeoples said ABSOLUTELY NOTHING of any significance is atypical for even his minimalistic style and I think that difference is telling. smallpeoples seems to be a player in good faith, but I think he played radically different in this game, and while there's the potential confounding variable that the game's activity was lower than average, I think the fact that his contribution style was different (i.e. the total absence of it) was just that.<br>\n* The scumhunting approach of Locke, with the Sky case anyway, essentially zooms in on one post and tries to nitpick at it. I think he's nitpicking much more at anti-Town play over scummy play, and firing at someone solely over one post doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. Essentially, it's plus points for starting a bold, new innovative wagon, but minus points for the approach as it didn't really encapsulate scumminess so much as nitpicky anti-Town play. (fencesitting mostly)<br>\n<br>\nWhat I find peculiar is the fact that smalls wasn't even brought up in the front game. Usually scum love to point out the fact that this sort of lurking is scummy when it's a Town player doing it.

In that situation, mine would be 'hey, that 'no result' makes perfect sense now'. At the very least you pause for a bit and wait to hear the target instead of coming firmly down on the side of not believing him.

I don't understand the pushing for Sky to be lynched last day phase, there surely would have been better ways of trying to prove or disprove the claim than going ahead and lynching sky at that point - there was no counter claim, nothing to suggest we should regard Sky as a liar. Yes her actions in regards to Jam were a little suspect and yes the role may or may not have been a completely normal but isn't it 2 variations allowed per game or something? it's not exactly a massive difference in the role anyway. <br>\n<br>\nI fancy either David or Locke for scum at the moment but in my eyes - Not both, it's a very risky play to have put both onto a lynch of a gunsmith, especially if there are 3 scum as we'd be in LYLO now (if scum then took out a town last night) and they wouldn't have gotten the victory automatically and without someone to push the blame onto because the 2 main people on the lynch would have been both scum they'd have lost someone for sure. One of them scum? Probably. Both? Unlikely. <br>\n<br>\nThe issue is i can't see any other partnerships at the moment, david and Locke just seem too likely but in all of the wrong ways.

Maybe youre hoping that someone will see my eagerness to lynch you will see me as scum trying to pull a fast one and end the game.

Play little bullshit mind games? Right now any proper townie would be going insane with anxiety over losing the game. Yelling, screaming, even downright pleading.

You should be jumping up and down in RAAAAAAGE over the mislynch. <br>\n<br>\nExcept you act like dont give a shit about anything except thinking that you can torment me somehow, haunt my dreams.
