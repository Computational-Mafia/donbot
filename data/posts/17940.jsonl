Votes should be in the form <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Player</span> (or bolded) or they may not be counted. It is helpful to \"Unvote\" when switching your vote to a different player. Votes, will only be counted once you have Unvoted.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">3.</span> Whenever a player has a majority in votes, that player will be lynched, his or her role will be revealed, and Night will begin. Once a player has reached a majority, Twilight will begin. No votes or unvotes will be registered, although talking may continue until the thread is locked. You may also Vote: No Lynch; a majority will end Day without a death.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">4.</span> If discussion lags or Day goes on for too long, a deadline may be set. If no one has reached a majority at the deadline, the person with the most votes will be lynched.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">5. </span>During Night, players with role abilities may send targets for those abilities.

Do not talk until the game is over; this includes talking to living players outside the thread.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">10.</span> I will send out prods at my discretion/on request.

He didn't vote/unvote at L-2/L-1, so Emp was never at L-1. He was at L-3 at the time of Mal's post, which is why I pointed out that it was weird that mal felt the need to vote/unvote Emp in the same post with the incorrect reasoning that he didn't want him to be at L-1. As with my first vote of Empking I was building early wagons to fuck around and draw out reactions from people. <br><br>Again, dumb or inexperienced thinking that by saying \"A vote can be for reaction\" I mean \"I want to see how X reacts when I vote for him\" as opposed to \"I want to see how all players react when I vote for X\". Big difference, and kinda moots your argument somewhat.<br><br>I wanted to see what would happen, and I saw what happened. Now I need to work out if you're overzealous and new, or inexperienced and scum."}

I can't see how my post could be construed as 'pissed off'.<br><br>3) \" I forgive you. Just please remove you vote, ok?\" This is odd, and I need to process it. I've never been told that I'm forgiven for voting for someone at the same time as being asked to remove the vote.  Again, if mal had taken the time to read the game fully before jumping to post about my vote he would have seen that I've already moved my vote. Is this a scum tactic? Insult someone's play, then condescend them while asking to get the vote removed?"}

By the time I checked the thread again, the day was over.  The three people that jumped out at me for Day 1 were smallpeoples, Internet Stranger, and Rikana.  Smallpeoples for the terrible lurking (hypocritical, I know).<br><br>Internet Stranger's tunnelling I didn't like at all.  He basically tunnelled on Malp.  Throughout the day I mainly saw from him posts about Malpascp being scummy, posts criticizing the game's lack of content, or planning for future days based on what Malp's alignment was.  He had more criticism about the thread than he did attempts to improve the thread . . . which seems like a spot that lazy scum would try to stay in.  Gives the appearance of caring about how the game is dying, but not really helping its condition at all.  Not to mention helping to muscle through a town lynch.<br><br>As for Rikana, I don't like how he consistently called Malp town, but didn't make much of an effort to try to derail the wagon.  As the game neared deadline, that became less scummy, and in his first couple of posts, he did.  But for the majority of day one, it seemed like all he did was say \"map town, bristep scum\" and then got out of the way.  No real sense of urgency to try to turn his opinions into flips.  And a scum who wanted to get credit for calling Malp town wouldn't neccessarily want to stop Malp from being lynched.  <br><br>Alright, now for Day 2:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Internet Stranger wrote:</cite>LYNCHED (Internet stranger, JAMFTW, Bristep123, Empking, Sky, Swiftstrike, Smallpeople343)<br><br>So like I said, at least one of these people is scum. Obviously, its neither me or Bristep. I nominate JAM<br><br>Vote: JAMFTW</div></blockquote><br><br>Given what I said above about IS, this bothers me.  Strongarm the lynch, and then immediately suspect everyone who went along with it?  You clearly aren't above suspicion here, and I find your rush to move on to the next suspect suspicious.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>yabbaguy wrote:</cite>Vote: Internet Stranger for illogical and reckless wagon push. I don't approve, JAM was not a lurker, he was inactive.<br><br>I also think IS is pointing out the lurking for Townpoints, but actually isn't and wasn't doing a hell of a lot to actively solve that problem. Just idly \"stop doing it\" \"I'll wait\" \"Not my problem, waiting for the dust to settle\"<br><br>Stuff along those lines.</div></blockquote><br><br>yabbaguy knows what's up.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>JAMFTW wrote:</cite>Rather odd, given the fact that he had an earlier post, so I don't think he's been silenced.</div></blockquote><br><br>You play EM, alright.

However, I don't get a town-vibe from IS's tunnelling thus far.  Town tunnelling will often have case development, though the newfound points get more trivial as the case goes on, and are usually found in the midst of nitpicky arguing.  IS didn't have that, really.  He just sat there saying \"Malp scum\" and reiterating his reasons.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Empking wrote:</cite>Very happy with my vote now.

These posts are eerily similar.<br><br>2.  This is the trouble with getting behind in a game based only in one thread.  Though I noticed the same patterns that the others who suspect IS noticed, I noticed them before I read that they noticed them.  Of course, there's no way to prove that, so there's no real point an arguing it, but my vote was not opportunistic from my perspective.  I made my post as I read the thread, rather than read the thread and then summarize everything.  It's easier that way to quote the relevant information and include everything that you've noticed."}

So either youre both scum (which fits nicely with you declaring a hardcore green townie) or youre just a dumbass White Knight that deserves death for being one regardless.<br><br>My vote stays.</div></blockquote><br><br>1.  What does White Knight mean?  I've heard it a few times, but haven't asked about it yet.<br><br>2.  I don't like the top section of this post.  It's got the air of \"Well <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I</span> certainly can't be blamed as having a role in malp's lynch.  Look at all the other people who voted!  They're much scummier than I!\"  (That should be read in a British accent).  It feels like you're trying to back out of taking blame for the lynch, when you were the loudest voice gunning for it to go through.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Sky wrote:</cite>While Shadow could be joining the IS bandwagon, it isn't as if Empking has been doing anything much insightful. He constantly votes with no explanation, and when there is one, it's minimal at best. I realize I haven't been insightful either, so call me a hypocrite, whatever, I'm lazy. <br><br>vote: Empking</div></blockquote><br><br>This vote bothers me . . . though I can't find a reason for it beyond gut.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SomeRandomGuy wrote:</cite>As for my suspicions: I had been a little suspious of FS, this is why i asked about his dropping of Empking as one of his scum reads, it seemed a little odd, he's explained it fairly well and so that has cleared it up mostly for me. IS seems to be the most likely candidate to me: I find myself trusting 2 of the people on the wagon, I find that his commenting on lack of content yet adding little is as detrimental to town as lurkers yet also putting himself out there in good light, if FS seems oppertunistic to him, that seems oppertunistic to me. </div></blockquote><br><br>This vote bothers me as well, but I can put my finger on why:  he copied others' reasoning, but didn't mention that they thought of it as well.  He's trying to pass this off as his own original thought, but I don't really buy it. <br><br>I know this looks hypocritical of me, but I did point out when yabbaguy said something that matched what I was thinking.  SRG makes no mention of the other IS voters in this post at all.<br><br>Also, the last bit where I'm mentioned, I don't really understand what SRG is trying to say.  However, it feels slightly like buddying.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Internet Stranger wrote:</cite>Im telling you, the scum are JAM and one of these two clowns. Yabba is coming to his senses somewhat, so im not as suspicious of him right now, despite his White Knighting, I will certainly be revisiting that later. That should also clear smallpeoples a bit for now as well.</div></blockquote><br><br>Someone drops suspicion of you, so you drop suspicion of them?  This is basically reverse OMGUS . . . like your trying to keep yabba off of you by dropping him once he stopped questioning you.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Internet Stranger wrote:</cite>The two people on my wagon are also trustable?!? trustable? Isnt that the very definition of sheeping? You should be roasted for such blatant scum tactics that youre trying to employ.</div></blockquote><br><br>I'd add buddying to that. <br><br>SRG isn't doing himself any favors in the page 12 exchange with IS . . . which is conflicting.  I don't feel like they would both be scum together doing something like this, but both look scummy now.  I'd still lean more towards IS though."}

I'd also like to hear more from FS because he hasn't had a lot of posts for me to read back on and Emp seemed to be his previous scum read who he has now not mentioned, trying to work out if his motives for the case against IS that he presented are clear would be quite a big thing with my reads.</fieldset><br><br>Nah.<br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\">What I'd say for you is to look at the other game i'm in (Newbie 1117) the inactive periods here will match up there, including the time i hadn't posted my V/LA. I had hoped my internet would be up much quicker than it was, the reason my posts slowed up before finally the v/la is because i was leeching internet across the road, the connection there got quite bad to the point of being unable to connect most of the time and my only real access to the net from then was walking to another street with my partners macbook which i did once or twice to prod dodge / say i'll be back soon. This was the reason i didn't place a vote onto Malp I had put an FoS in place i didn't want to take it to L-1 real early and by the time i got back to this game again the day had ended. <br><br>The inactivity has left me sort of treading water, both in my reads and post content - something which will shorlty be rectified.<br><br>As for my suspicions: I had been a little suspious of FS, this is why i asked about his dropping of Empking as one of his scum reads, it seemed a little odd, he's explained it fairly well and so that has cleared it up mostly for me. IS seems to be the most likely candidate to me: I find myself trusting 2 of the people on the wagon, I find that his commenting on lack of content yet adding little is as detrimental to town as lurkers yet also putting himself out there in good light, if FS seems oppertunistic to him, that seems oppertunistic to me. <br><br>VOTE: Internet Stranger</fieldset><br><br>So now the IS vote comes down at long last - took him 4 days. The inactive periods did NOT match though, you had the ability to come to this game and you didn't. You just didn't want to play this game for some reason.<br><br>It's been SUCH a problem throughout the whole game. You just aren't scumhunting actively, you're taking such a laid back approach to the game and watching ourselves fuck up.

Do tell me what of the 'state of the game' by that point i was ignoring.<br><br>You also said you'd come back with more, which you haven't - because i was saying you're likely the scum on my wagon or just hoping your vote gets forgotten about?"}

I believe he may be incorrect there, or not have an as large FoS. I know he's wrong about Smalls, because this is how he always plays(pst badly).

Other people were trying to get the game going in a direction that might actually find scum. You can say it wasn't having much effect, in your opinion, but you can't deny that people had moved away from RVS and were voting and making genuine accusations. You did nothing - and I mean nothing - to try to continue that. You didn't even acknowledge that. Even after that initial RQS post, when there was an interchange of more substance between Rikana and Bristep, you don't address that at all. The contrast between you and other players who didn't offer much on D1 is that you were still posting content - it just seemed to have very little to do with the actual point of the game. When I see a lot of words and no scumhunting, I think scum. <br><br>So is it normal for you to spend several days at the start of the game without putting any effort into finding scum? Is it normal for you to ignore the interactions between other players? What do you think you got out of RQS that helped you to scumhunt, and why did you prefer that to analysing the existing arguments in the game? Why do you think I'm scum when all I seem to have done is some fairly accurate analysis of your D1 play? As far as I can tell, you agree with what I've said in terms of how you've played, but your defence is that other people have done the same things as you have.<br><br>FightingShadow: when you said that SRG didn't do himself any favours in his page 12 exchange with IS, what were you referring to specifically? Why do you find him apparently less scummy now?<br><br>Peregrine: I can't find why you think Rikana following Bristep's ideas is actually scummy.

The reason that you can't take a joke and had to include it in, when it's seriously the most inconsequential detail in the game is infuriating. Yes, this is a rage wall. Don't like it?

Is that a bad technique? No. Is it hypocritical to the max? YES.

But it reads more of a bored townie than it does of a lurker scum, for now at least.</div></blockquote>This is in reference to Small's post about going prod dodging, without saying /proddodge.<br><br>Hey! This looks familiar!<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Internet Stranger wrote:</cite>Why is this game filled with so much garbage? All this does is help the scum hide.</div></blockquote>What content is here? Complains about everything(like usual).<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>IS wrote:</cite>If for some reason we are wrong, we need to go after an off-voter.<br>If for some reason we are right, then we need to go after the ringleaders of the peoples wagon (sorry Yabbaguy)</div></blockquote>Setting up lynches. Even if it includes everyone, IS could know Malp's alignment. Not even that, it's shitty logic at best. <br><br>Let's move a bit forward to one of IS' later posts.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>IS wrote:</cite>Rikana wants EVERYONE dead, apparently.</div></blockquote>Considering that I labeled 4 people(Peregrine, IS, BU, PeregrineV), no I didn't. Let's see how many people IS wants dead though!<br><br>Malp was wanted, JAM, Random(now two dead on his list. Better reputation than me!), Yabba. That's 4. We're equal. And I'm completely sure, even though you haven't said it, that Empking will be your target later. Of course, I have no proof of that. I'm pretty sure everyone knows this by now though.<br><br>Continuing with lack of content, IS is, as usual, hypocritical in the fact that he barely gives any real concrete content with his reasoning. For all we know, IS could be bullshitting everything he's said. Am I going to check everything? No. It's way too late, hot and I'm too annoyed to do that already. <br><br>so,<br><br>why is this scumbag seen as town again?<br><br>I'll make a separate post for PeregrineV."}

PeregrineV.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>PeregrineV wrote:</cite>@Sky- If Rikana answers you, then send her over to me.</div></blockquote>See this? This is pure instigation at its best.

You should not vote someone because you know the person is scummy but the slot may not be scum. It should be a union due to the player being scummy.

Still though, it all leads down to NK analysis which is almost always bogged down with WIFOM and seems to give town a bogus lynch candidate most of the time. <br><br>If I did fall for yabba fishing for scum information there, I'll feel extremely stupid but I still don't think that's the case right now."}

I really don't want to believe that is the inspiration for the claim - it also doesn't mention the mechanics of the role there, he'd have had to read that post, look the role up on the wiki come back here and claim it (assuming he didn't know the jailkeeper role). If he did know the role, it could have served as a reminder but 5 minutes to have viewed that (assuming he read it the moment it was posted) and then post is still quite quick. I'm not by any means saying i believe his claim, I don't - the fact he didn't mention the action of night 1 (which could well help to give us information on a townie or at least eliminate someone from being yesterdays killer) with the claim is odd, especially given IS had told him he had just ONE post to explain himself well or he'd hammer. <br><br>Also:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Jam wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">I'll do what I can tonight to lessen the damage I've caused. </span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">I doubt I'll be able to pull this around in time, but here's hoping I can help out during the next day.</span><br></div></blockquote><br><br>The bolded sounded like it was going to be a doctor / jailkeeper claim (lessen the damage = Stop someone getting killed?) However, the latter part 'I doubt i'll be able to pull this around in time' doesn't really make sense, It could refer to the possibility he could protect someone there would be no kill and he'd be able to say 'X was who i targetted' which leaves a 50/50 of that person being scum / town. I initially read this soft claim to be about a cop however via the sound of it, the last bit seemed to heavily suggest a possibility of him finding scum but thinking back, as a whole the wording fits more with what he is now claiming. <br><br>I honestly don't understand his soft claiming at all, if town he made himself a possible target for the night phase, if this had happened he would have been unable to get us ANY information the next day, not from the previous night, not from that night. I mean it was extremely unlikely he would have been hit prior to his soft claim, the scum (if he was town) could easily steer a mislynch at him the next day and he'd have had very easy passage to have at least get the town 2 night results before his lynch day  3. The thing is it's painted almost as though regardless of a very obvious soft claim he was still unlikely to be killed - it's an out for not getting killed that night phase come the next day but from a town point of view it makes NO sense after the soft claim."}

Maybe scum thought it was indicative of a PR, perhaps they killed him simply because his involvement has been low and there's not a lot for the town to make out of it. In my experience when scum try killing someone to set someones else up it's very unstable, in that the town often views it as a stitch up attempt and goes after people they think might instigate it etc, i've seen it blow up in peoples faces.<br><br>What i'd say is for the reason people who haven't been too vocal need to be, Bristep also seemed like a fairly random kill and if that's what the scum are aiming for we need to try and limit it. I'm not a massive advocater of NK analysis because of all the wifom that often comes with it, but it would be nice if they didn't have any free kills and they had to think of that themselves. <br><br> @Yabba - If Empking had still been alive and one of your 'massive question mark' people were to have lived, how would you have placed him?"}

Unfortunately, the case would be very hard to present. IS of late is seemingly town, or at least seems to carry good intentions. I don't know what to think of Peregrine and Swiftstrike. From what I've heard of Locke, he seems town but he really needs to be here more. And then Rikana.... I know I have some pretty backward logic here, but here me out. He has been off the two wagons that lynched our fellow citizens malp and JAM. Naturally, this is town behavior since he wasn't in on getting town killed. But he never really gives clear reasons for why they weren't scum, he says malp is an easy mislynch and I don't even know what he said about JAM, if he said anything at all, but he didn't go for it, he was conveniently fighting with Peregrine. It seems to me that Rikana has been avoiding the town lynching wagons in order to appear like she isn't scum.<br><br>Since I'm new at concealed setups, and we don not know the number of scum, does the mod let us know when it's MyLo or LyLo?"}

I'm going to point out the worst post in relation to the JAM lynch and break it down:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Sky wrote:</cite>The one thing that I don't like about this mislynch is the fact SRG didn't know he wasn't headed toward the gallows. I mean, I think if I were actively playing I'd know just how far away I was to getting killed. But then again, he isn't that active, and he's really been contributing now. Plus I love his use of \"hella\" which for those who don't know, means he's a Nor Calian, and we gotta stick together.<br><br>Of the people on the hammer, I find Locke townish. Just a feel. yabba is extremely town, but somehow too much so. Gut read would say scum but I have nothing much to go off on other than intuition. Emp, I find scum. IS hard to say. Not town. Neutral. And lastly JAM... well here goes.<br><br>The hammer is obviously scummy. And obvious enough for scum to actually do it since this a crucial point in the game. Meaning, JAM is the sacrificial kinda scum that would be worth it since if SRG went through, scum would have an upper hand. Guessing at the amount of scum there are of course. So it is scummy, no matter how obvious it looks. I've found JAM to be hazy this game, definitely not town.  So JAM looks a lot better than the SRG lynch so there you have it. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote, Vote: JAMFTW</span></div></blockquote><br><br>So here are the scummy things about this post:<br><br>1. He goes out of his way to provide some crappy reasons why SRG still shouldn't be the lynch. Up to this point he's basically said nothing about SRG other than that he hasn't really got a read on him. Now he apparently feels the need to justify the switch to JAM based on SRG's towniness as well as JAM's scumminess. And just what does he mean by 'mislynch' here anyway?<br><br>2. His reasons for his reads on the other players. Oh yeah. There aren't any. He goes through Yabba, Emp, IS and myself without giving a single reason for the reads other than 'gut'.<br><br>3. The terrible over-justification of why the hammer is scummy in the third paragraph. It almost reads as though he's trying to convince himself it's true. 'Guessing at the amount of scum there are of course' is such an unnecessary inclusion for anyone who's not paranoid about looking like they actually know how many scum there are, and he seems to be self-aware of how much he's over-simplifying the situation when he says 'So it is scummy, no matter how obvious it looks'.

What you actually said prior to making that statement on SRG was:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Sky wrote:</cite>I'm trying to make sense of this slot thing, and I need to review SRG because I haven't spent much time there. One more question for Rikana, why were you so intent on carrying out the \"legacy\" of Bristep after you found him suspicious yesterday?</div></blockquote><br><br>So you obviously didn't even know what the reasons for the SRG wagon were. How could you find them flawed?<br><br>2. No, I don't want reasons for the players based on what you've seen since. In that post you stated 4 reads and no reasons. You said your town read on me was 'just a feel', so if you actually thought I was town based on originality, why not say that? Your IS and Yabba reads have changed since that post anyway, so providing reasoning for them now is irrelevant, and Emp's the only one who you actually had anything solid on at all. I think in both this response and the previous one, you're making up reasons that were simply not true at the time you made that post.<br><br>3. I understand what you're saying in that paragraph. It's got nothing to do with brevity (and I'm really not that brief a poster relative to the likes of IS and Emp). The point is, it reads like you're talking yourself into why scum would have hammered (or attempted to hammer) in that situation, and pre-emptively finding reasons to dismiss arguments that say 'wait a minute, wouldn't it be pretty stupid for JAM-scum to hammer there?'. My sense is you're aware it's an easy vote based on a careless piece of play, and you're trying too hard to justify it as scum play. <br><br>4. You framed the post in such a way that it was SRG vs JAM, and JAM was suddenly an obvious lynch despite the fact you'd indicated no real desire to lynch him prior to that. I think that was unrepresentative, both of the state of the game at the time and of your personal stated suspicions. If it was 24 hours to deadline and they were both at L-2, for example, that post would have made sense. You prematurely indicated that you almost had no choice but to vote for JAM, and that your reads on the two players were far more confident than you'd previously stated."}

I made an error in not saying that the orange corresponded to the \"I'm not sure - but they're probably scum\" side of it. As to the \"charge\" of me saying that I was declaring obvTown, why should I rush it? I lost a Newbie game because I said \"I've called one SUPER-DUPER-OBVIOUS Town, I'll just blast the other two and the other scum will drop\". Oops, the towniest one was the scum. Realizing that I'm scumhunting worse than a random monkey all over again, I won't scream as loudly as I did last Day. (It's the newbie game with Paws and foilist, I forget which #, check the yGDB if you'd like - but I can link the incident when I get home) That's why even though I say \"oh yeah, of course he's Town, I still don't follow it\". This is why I decided not to vote. And besides that, a vote also is a game mechanic that declares interest in ending the Day, and I didn't want the Day to end seeing as I really wasn't sure. It's actually mental uncertainty, it's like \"I just know he's Town, I just have that feeling\".

I mean, this was me having screamed at the top of my lungs for a JAM lynch and having it fail. Therefore, what I wanted to do was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">non-intrusively</span> state what I felt and then start the debate from there. Where was I taking the lead? I was taking a more passive role, this ISN'T me ringleading until Swift lies to my face, so to speak. What is so wrong with a Day where everyone just talks before they vote, presuming everyone actually gets involved (nope)? I take firm stances, but I expect Town to disagree with me.<br><br>Then Swift lies and I immediately discard the strategy of being passive. Yup.<br><br>Again, am I too aggressive or am I too passive?

It's not my fault that you guys are abysmal at being more outright with your opinions. There is NOTHING wrong with just stating a player-by-player and allowing the dialogue to go towards \"what do you think?\" more than \"DO THIS DO THIS\". I did not do any direct action, hence it's \"what do you think?\". I was being open, I was trying to contribute to a Town game. What is the proper Town thing to do in this stance, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">was I supposed to vote?

The proper Town play was to sit back, state a few stances, and see where the conversation went. I adamantly assert that it is Town motivated. What is scummy?

I didn't say it at first because I wasn't sure myself. I thought your post on SRG was more original, but you had, and still have, hardly posted in this game. I can say it more so now since you've got a good case, even though it's wrong. But if you believe what I said above, which you probably don't, I didn't want to say you were creative because I wasn't sure.  It was a feeling based off a small post of imagination, since it was virtually your only post of yesterday. <br>3. What I had to do was convince myself that I was doing the right thing for the town, and sometimes the best way to do that is to write it out, so I can look back at just what I was thinking.<br>4. I was confused about the deadline because I'm stupid, but maybe that was after that post. Either way, yesterdays was going to be SRG or JAM. I do know that's how it was when I posted that. I went for JAM because I felt so sure of that false hammer.

As for it 'not being that bad' that you made up a reason for not being interested in the SRG case, yes, it is that bad. There's no other motivation for that other than trying to pad out your reasoning by claiming opinions you never had. <br><br>As for saying things you're not sure of, you just told me that you were actually writing that post out partly to convince yourself that you were doing the right thing, so that's just plain hypocritical. Your play indicates that you would have no problem saying 'I get a town feel from Locke because his post shows originality, but I'm not sure as the slot has contributed very little'. So I don't see the issue with saying that over what you claimed at the time was essentially a gut read, which requires no effort to justify and can easily be rescinded later. <br><br>Can I also ask why you were so sure of the false hammer? What was it that made you sure it was scum strategy and not clumsy town play?<br><br>Yabba: I see where you're coming from, but I think Swiftstrike basically just had a point that he wasn't articulating very well. Do you often see scum make a point and then immediately change the meaning of it? I think it was worded in a contradictory fashion, but I don't see anything about the way SS presented it that makes it more likely to be a scumtell."}

He was simply inactive in the gap between the 3rd and the 6th, mind you, but when he came back, he's sort of flung a lazy suspicion onto SRG. I'm not sure what this attempts to accomplish.<br>* I'm looking back at what smallpeoples said when he opted out, and I'm realizing where I may have called it uberTown by accident. He mentions \"despite the fact that some didn't care\" more in the sense of the fact that some players generally were of the opinion that he wasn't doing much wrong. Take for example Bristep, who I believe said \"that's not really a fo sho scumtell, is it?\" I think here he references moreso the fact that players were saying \"lurking's more anti-Town than scummy\". That's why I'm reversing back on this stupid Towntell I had, and it's interesting how LoLa veered out of his way to persuade me another one was wrong.<br>* With that out of the way, I think the fact that smallpeoples said ABSOLUTELY NOTHING of any significance is atypical for even his minimalistic style and I think that difference is telling. smallpeoples seems to be a player in good faith, but I think he played radically different in this game, and while there's the potential confounding variable that the game's activity was lower than average, I think the fact that his contribution style was different (i.e. the total absence of it) was just that.<br>* The scumhunting approach of Locke, with the Sky case anyway, essentially zooms in on one post and tries to nitpick at it. I think he's nitpicking much more at anti-Town play over scummy play, and firing at someone solely over one post doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. Essentially, it's plus points for starting a bold, new innovative wagon, but minus points for the approach as it didn't really encapsulate scumminess so much as nitpicky anti-Town play. (fencesitting mostly)<br><br>What I find peculiar is the fact that smalls wasn't even brought up in the front game. Usually scum love to point out the fact that this sort of lurking is scummy when it's a Town player doing it. Here, it passed completely (almost completely?) without mention until I entered."}

Instead he went straight to stating that he didn't buy the claim. Think about it. You're an investigative PR, and someone else claims that they are a jailkeeper. What's the first thing you think? In that situation, mine would be 'hey, that 'no result' makes perfect sense now'. At the very least you pause for a bit and wait to hear the target instead of coming firmly down on the side of not believing him. Now Sky keeps saying that he's stupid and he just didn't think about it, which feels like a pity AtE. He doesn't seem stupid to me.<br><br>Sky: are you saying that when JAM originally made the claim, your thought was that a jailkeeper would have affected your result?<br><br>Yabba: I won't bother to address your points made about smallpeoples, but to answer your other points, yes, I've not really been here since Sky's claim, so my lack of contributions has been to personal time constraints. As for my case against Sky, it's pretty typical for me to look at a lynch wagon and see who made the poorest, most forced justification of a vote. So yeah, I do like to focus on one post in that situation. I believe sometimes you can get a pretty strong sense that someone is scum from one post, and that's what I got from that post."}

On one hand, there are multiple reasons to think he's scum, such as the repeated fabrication of reasoning in response to my case and the dubious response to JAM's claim.

If there's anyone on the Sky wagon who's hopped on in a scummy fashion, it's Peregrine, and SS doesn't even appear to think David's scum.

I don't understand the pushing for Sky to be lynched last day phase, there surely would have been better ways of trying to prove or disprove the claim than going ahead and lynching sky at that point - there was no counter claim, nothing to suggest we should regard Sky as a liar. Yes her actions in regards to Jam were a little suspect and yes the role may or may not have been a completely normal but isn't it 2 variations allowed per game or something? it's not exactly a massive difference in the role anyway. <br><br>I fancy either David or Locke for scum at the moment but in my eyes - Not both, it's a very risky play to have put both onto a lynch of a gunsmith, especially if there are 3 scum as we'd be in LYLO now (if scum then took out a town last night) and they wouldn't have gotten the victory automatically and without someone to push the blame onto because the 2 main people on the lynch would have been both scum they'd have lost someone for sure. One of them scum? Probably. Both? Unlikely. <br><br>The issue is i can't see any other partnerships at the moment, david and Locke just seem too likely but in all of the wrong ways. I'm going to ISO both (and the people they replaced) plus do a bit of general reading. The Malp wagon is interesting, i'm going to look again at the wagon on me as whilst i can't expect anyone else to take it as 100% I atleast can and it was practically a lynch and I feel there was likely scum on it. <br><br>Also a quick note to all:<br><br>Don't place more than 1 vote on any one person at a time - if this is MYLO and we do have 3 scum, whilst unlikely it could lead to a hammer that we don't want, so no one voting David for now at least please."}

And the fact that had people actually listened to my Swift case, even if for some reason it was actually inaccurate, it would've lynched scum. I had Swift-scum nailed, even, but that's really all I can claim. I could've gone on about how either IS or I had kept our mouths shut just a little bit, things might've actually been better. But I don't need to go on about how this was all just another session of bullshit, because that's how I feel bad in the end. I actually feel quite bad despite getting shafted pretty badly.<br><br>The problem I have is this - if I suddenly STOP being active, then it suddenly becomes a matter of \"wait, where the fuck is yabb when it actually matters?\" So I can't really stop being a loudmouth, but that said, I have to remember that I am absolutely rubbish at hunting and need to shut up more from the start.<br><br>It was kinda necessary though with the way Day 1 went.<br><br>Also miffed that the 2-shot vig never got both shots off.

I knew it would be impossible for me to keep up with the game, which is what I said. Why he gave me a V/LA when I even specifically said in the PM that I would tell him if I could replace back into myself after my replacement note? I really have no clue, and it's annoying me pretty badly.<br><br>So, basically, I couldn't use any shots because the last thing I was going to do, not to make anyone angry or anything, was to play a game on an alt. that I barely kept up with at any rate. I will apologize for not shooting on N2, that was probably my only real mistake, but I couldn't do anything N3, due to not being there. I would've never shot on N1. That's just a policy with myself, unless I'm deadset on scum. When I say deadset, I mean incriminating evidence with backup from other people."}
