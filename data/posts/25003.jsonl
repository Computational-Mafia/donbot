Reasoning: Most, if not all, Mini Normal games played on this site have had at least two non-town players.<br> - At this unbiased point in the game, each player that is not me has at least a 17% chance of being non-town.

But a mafia (not just scum, but mafia)-aligned player who knows he has at least one partner would likely think differently about stating this fact than town would. He might feel the need to over-explain this so that it wouldn't look for a second like he knows how many mafia there are in the setup, and when it becomes decidedly clear that there is a mafia team in the game, no one will be able to accuse him of knowing too much. It's kind of irrational, because like I said, everyone knows that it's common sense that there is almost certainly more than one scum present, and most likely a scum team--but one big advantage that the town has is the fact that scum have difficulty \"forgetting\" that they are scum and psychologically placing themselves in the role of a townie.

But a mafia (not just scum, but mafia)-aligned player who knows he has at least one partner would likely think differently about stating this fact than town would. He might feel the need to over-explain this so that it wouldn't look for a second like he knows how many mafia there are in the setup, and when it becomes decidedly clear that there is a mafia team in the game, no one will be able to accuse him of knowing too much. It's kind of irrational, because like I said, everyone knows that it's common sense that there is almost certainly more than one scum present, and most likely a scum team--but one big advantage that the town has is the fact that scum have difficulty \"forgetting\" that they are scum and psychologically placing themselves in the role of a townie.

That does look like a scum-kill to me, as Norlkaz was thought of as town by...well, pretty much everyone. I'm not positive of what to make of the fact that the kill was Norlkaz without stumbling into WIFOM, but my guess would be that it might have had something to do with the fact that he was considered obvtown by most people. The person who is most \"cleared\" would be a likely scum target, as people will be more likely to listen to that person, (this plays into Revenus' idea of \"he was onto something,\" but again, that's subject to WIFOM) and killing the most inno-looking makes for one less player that would not be a good or likely target for accusations, finger-pointing, false suspicions, and general BS/misguided scumhunting.<br><br>The one good thing about Norlkaz's death is that we have one person who is cleared now. We can go back on what he said (and thankfully, he gave us quite a bit) and take note of his suspicions--while they may not be correct, we at least know they were genuine.

Because the original reason you think Chevre is scum is independent of whether I'm scum, and so therefore your logic of \"if rev is scum, then chevre is scum\" is flawed.</div></blockquote>"}

Therefore, I wanted to make sure that they posted more before the end of the day. I think the case on me in general is built on misunderstandings. IAAU, all you're doing is repeatedly paraphrasing and wildly misrepresenting my posts. Of course they look scummy if you put a scummy spin on it. I just don't get the idea of scum saying \"oh, he's getting too close to the truth, time to shut him up!\" right in broad daylight. It's not that he wasn't right about a lot of things--I think his feelings were spot-on about Chevre and Boshka, and yeah, they could kill him for that. But he already made it clear who he thought was town/scum, and obviously we're going to look at that even more now, so I don't see the logic there.

Why, because other town do, and they can blend in without doing any scumhunting.<br><br>For the town on my wagon, ask yourself, would you just regular RVS vote and blend in as scum, or would you pull that crap that Chevre did. When you realize that it is the former, than start looking at the people who 1) jumped on my wagon with you, and 2) are not doing much else in the game.<br><br>I will do likewise. When I scumhunt, I usually ask myself when reading a player, what would I do in there case if I were scum. It has helped me to alot of town wins as my record in the sig shows.<br><br>Looks like I am at L-1. I will claim when someone off my wagon expresses the intent to hammer, and not a moment sooner.

His post to me indicates that he's THINKING. and not just willy nilly posting votes or pushing wagon.

If I feel on the fence about someone, I'm going to say I'm on the fence about that person at that moment. I came in with the intention of saying a few sentences about the one person I really wanted to hear from today. As I got into the swing of my thoughts, I felt the need to say more. Sometimes putting your thoughts down makes you realize that your conclusions aren't necessarily right.

Just because I may not come up with a definitive conclusion with every post rofl-style, doesn't mean that my opinions and considerations are \"hot air.\"<br><br>For those who don't seem to get why I think eddie's emotional + analytical style speaks to his alignment, it seems to me that scum players are more careful than town players in general. That's why rofl and Rev look town to me, despite my not thinking their playstyles are particularly helpful, and that's why eddie felt more town to me than Boshka, who was controlled to the point of asking the town what he should think. I figure that's what Norlkaz meant D1 when he said scum plays \"tighter\" than town. I'm starting to lose that townread the more eddie tries to sell the Revenus BS and the idea that Chev's lynch was somehow a huge eff-up that he could have prevented had he been there to save the day.<br><br>CE, question.

The difference, I think, between scum clinging to this idea in hopes to frame someone and misled town clinging to the idea in desperate hopes to find scum would be that scum would be more likely, I think, to hold onto that idea against all odds. Now, they might let go of it to look better, but certainly a town player would realize that this was not good for the town, that perfectly competent TOWN players must have been on that wagon for Chev to have gotten lynched D1, and that it's time to admit that your supposed insight is actually just hindsight. To keep insisting on it is scummy.<br><br>Zhero looks like he keyed into the word \"doctor\" and immediately cried \"rolefishing.\" Not even questioning him on it--just throwing it out there to see if it would stick. It didn't. It was an easy little jab that seems to have backfired. Edo made some interesting potential catches as well, bringing up Zhero's almost identical reasoning for wanting to not lynch Chev and then wanting to lynch Chev. Zhero looked like he couldn't possibly justify not hopping on the Chev wagon anymore, so he came up with manufactured reasons and leaped on late.<br><br>I'm satisfied with what I've heard from Konowa.

I come back and SB has been replaced and his slot is pushing a lynch on Revenus. Deja vu?<br><br>Revenus has consistently displayed behavior that suggests a town alignment. Of course, I differentiate this from \"pro-town.\" Sometimes town-aligned players do not behave in a way that benefits the town, and I think that Revenus has shown that tendency off and on. It's his attitude that makes it obvious that he has nothing to hide. Sure, it's beneficial for scum to appear in such a way, but they'd have to be careful not to make a slip, and there's nothing that seems careful about Revenus. If it's faked, then it's expertly faked.<br><br>I'm a little worried about this pattern I'm seeing here with people replacing in and pushing for a Rev lynch. Guess it's tempting for scum to skim the game looking for someone that would be easy to frame on little things like the dayvig nonsense. That whole thing was scummy from CE and scummy from fitz, and it looks scummier now that it seems to be a 'thing.' In fitz's case especially it doesn't look like it has to do with having replacement knowledge of Chev's alignment. I'm starting to see the light concerning a SB/fitz lynch or possibly a CE one, although I'm still just fine with where my vote is. As for Konowa...eh. UVApe's hammer on Chevre still screams town alignment to me, although as I said before about Revenus, not necessarily PRO-town.<br><br>Zhero, I don't know what the hell you meant by saying you're willing to \"shelve the whole thing.\" One does not simply \"shelve\" things in Mafia, unless it's some sort of personal meta BS. Do you think I'm going to give up on you just because you say you're willing to \"let it go?\" I'm more convinced of your being scum than ever for that move.

Calls Norlkaz, Rest and ROFL town. Chevre too. Revenus gives him scumvibes (good). <span style=\"font-style: italic\">If Zhero or Rev were to flip scum I could see the other implicated by this subtle FOS. I also always register a slight suspicion towards anyone who joins a game at an excessively delayed time from the game's start (ex. 5.5 pages in) </span><br><br>#134 - Provides more details on his reads and that his case on Shepherd is due to fluffy posting and lack of stance on Chevre and Rev (when Zhero voted SB SB had all of 4 posts...soooooo what?) Seriously...he had had a vote on Rev at one point (for I assume pressure) and otherwise only one other vote was on Rev...so what more comment needed to be made on Rev? As for Chevre...did everyone comment on Chevre? Is lack of comment a scumtell? SB did at least try to get rofl's reasoning for voting Chevre and voted him (rofl) for a lack of reasoning. That seems to be somewhat of a stance IMO. <span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">tl:dr;</span> Crap case on SB.</span><br><br>#158 - Chevre's disappearance is unsettling.<br><br>#189/190 - A question to and vote on Rest (considered town 3 pages earlier) for why I can not discern. Ah...sheeping Norlkaz and iiaun. ok.<br><br>#193 - Questions whether Chevre's replace out is a scumtell.<br><br>#226 - Asks Cheery if Rev is scum...<br><br>#228 - Calls an Edo post a \"town post\"<br><br>#231 - Claims to be using his own reasons for voting (<span style=\"font-style: italic\">though not the case with his Rest vote</span>)..<br><br>#243 - Votes Cheery Dog without providing any of the aforementioned \"own reasons\" , i.e. none.<br><br>#294 - Says Chevre replacing out and IAI's flailing looks like caught scum. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">But no vote is placed. This looks like subtle encouragement of IAI suspicions without the commitment...</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Day 2</span><br><br>#327 - Accuses CE of rolefishing (<span style=\"font-style: italic\">not</span>) and votes CE because he believes he is scum. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Ah...well. That's a good reason. /sarcasm</span><br><br>#362 - Rev is now a townread. Asks why someone considers UVApe town.<br><br>#363 - States DGB is town and that he is not sold on the Edo wagon.<br><br>#387 - Admits his rolefishing CE accusation was misplaced. Doesn't remove CE vote though.<br><br>#414 - Seems to be in agreement with CE on some points but still voting him.<br><br>#415 - Hems and haws (IMO) about the legitimacy of Chevre's wagon and gives UVApe a dig for hammering \"too soon.\"<br><br>#421 - Says scum him wouldn't do what it looks like he did wrt Chevre's lynch. WIFOM?<br><br>#429 - gets defensive towards Rest for making the same insinuation I do above (WIFOM?) and proceeds to vote Rest<br><br>#435 - Gets defensive against <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">I don't know who because he's doing the same failed quote sh;t the Rev was doing</span>. WhoTF are you quoting!! FFS!! Anyway....gets defensive (fine) and says he couldn't commit to Chevre's wagon (by voting) because that would have been the hammer and hammering would have been bad. o_0 I guess in hindsight it was. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">To me it looks like you want credit for suspecting Chevre but you don't want credit for being on his mislynch.</span> Ah...and townvibes from CE lately.<br><br>#437 - Calls out Rev for skimming...and he's mad.<br><br>#438 - Accuses Rest of being scumbuddies with CE (who 3 posts earlier was giving him townvibes). <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Wha huh? Next post he says he meant CD (so I assume he thinks CD is a buddy of Rest's and not CE). Still a bit confusing but whatever.</span><br><br>#447 - Explains who Konowa's suspects are to CE.<br><br>#449 - Asks Konowa for his read on him [Zhero]<br><br>#451 - Says he would like to shelve all the discussion with Rest and CE. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Not sure why....</span><br><br>#469 - Not feeling a Konowa lynch.<br><br>#476 - Says Konowa reads town to him and that my post reads town to him as well.<br><br>#513 - Begs me off of the Rev wagon and votes Edo. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Not sure if he suspects Edo but it is apparently the only ongoing wagon he would support.</span><br><br>Done. Bleh. I do find Zhero suspect. I do not see a lot of scumhunting and his opinion towards players seems to move around a lot. I also do not like the way he came across as supporting suspicions towards Chevre/IAI but was not willing to vote. And the early case on Shepherd was unwarranted IMO as well (and misguided for sure) but rather left his vote on someone who clearly wasn't going to be the D1 lynch (CD).<br><br>Not sure I'm going to have time to look Edo over today. Rest of my day is pretty busy in RL and checking in (time permitting) on some other games. Of the wagons currently out there...if my vote on Rev is not going to get any traction Zhero is my preference of the Konowa-Edo-Zhero group. That plus I feel the least apprehension towards those on his wagon as a whole.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Zhero</span>"}

So what do we know so far? (Warning: Wall of text incoming.)<br><br>Rev has a confirmed neighborizing ability, which makes him most likely town. I don't know the numbers on town neighborizers vs. scum neighborizers but I do think it's fair to say that he is almost certainly town-aligned. I don't think that Rev would recruit a scumbuddy the first night, making it even more unlikely that there is a Rev+CooLDoG team. I'd say that if Rev is town, CooLDoG would definitely get townie points.<br><br>CooLDoG's ability is not confirmed, as he only claimed his investigation on Edos AFTER he had Edos claim, and he did not say he was blocked until after Edos claimed JK. Neighbors, did CooLDoG ever talk about or hint at his role in the thread? If not, the truth of it is still debatable. If his ability does become confirmed, then I would say he is even more certainly town than Rev, but it's not. It's dangerous to act as if someone is confirmed when they're not. We shouldn't let people just coast until endgame...which may be very soon at hand if we screw this up...when they could conceivably be stringing us along.<br><br>I would say that the only way that Edos could be scum would be if CooLDoG is also scum. It would be very risky to fakeclaim a jailkeep on someone who is still alive and whose role is not known to be vanilla town. If CooLDoG is his mafia partner, then fine, they could be in on the ploy together, but I find that supremely unlikely.<br><br>Of all the possible combinations, I would say that the most likely of them would be that CooLDoG alone is scum, followed by Revenus alone. Edos is the least likely to be scum in my opinion, and is only scum if CooLDoG is scum. The only thing I see that is scummy about any of their behavior is that CooLDoG's explanation as to why he wanted Edos to claim made no sense...unless he thought he was some sort of no-kill mafia doctor or traitor role? Eh, it still doesn't make sense. If you see hoofprints, think horses, not zebras. (I think Revenus' unwillingness to claim is silly given that we are supposed to be massclaiming today, but I don't think it's scum behavior.) CooLDoG is maybe somebody to maybe look at tomorrow if we make it through mylo. I know I personally have been overlooking him as obvtown but I don't think we can afford to let anyone slide who isn't confirmed at this point.<br><br>So yeah. tl;dr version: No one is 100% confirmed. Edos is almost certainly town and is only even conceivably scum if CooLDoG is also scum. I'd say 95% likely to be town. CooLDoG is probably about 75% confirmed by his believable sounding roleclaim alone but his actions toward Edos cast some doubt...maybe bumping it down to around 70%. Rev is probably hanging at 85% town for a commonly pro-town role. Rev and CooLDoG are probably not mafia partners. Don't lynch any of them today, but if there's one of them (and only one) to look at tomorrow, it's CooLDoG.<br><br>Okay, it's late (early?) and I'm going to bed. Zhero, be our guest."}

And the scum among you.<br><br>I'm not big on defending myself tooth and nail, because I think my subsequent actions should speak for themselves, but apparently they're not, so here goes. The case on me today is eye-rolling BS. I thought it was hasty to say that we had three confirmed townies. Rofl says he thinks I'm scum flailing at the prospect of three confirmeds in front of her face, but do you think it's pro-town to pretend that three people are confirmed when you think that at least one of them conceivably isn't? Do you all just want me to take rofl's word for something when rofl could be scum? We're getting down to the wire and if we don't fuck this up, we are going to have the chance to lynch the last scum, so I want to make sure we look at everybody and don't let any potential scum coast or slide by on a good fakeclaim. That isn't to say that CD is fakeclaiming; I certainly think he isn't fakeclaiming now more than ever. I do think he's essentially confirmed now that he's pointed out his breadcrumb, but I'm a fairly cautious town player, and if you care you can prove that by my meta even from years ago. I don't like just writing people off as confirmed without actually thinking about the way their roles/claims interact with each other. Sorry, but...not sorry. Not sorry for the only way I know to react to a claim that three people are confirmed, which is check on it.<br><br>As for Zhero, he has been able to scrape by on minimal scumhunting, unexplained changes of heart that look like posturing, OMGUS, and hopping on and off my wagon. I'm flabbergasted that he was able to make it past yesterday when Konowa got lynched in his place, because he doesn't look like he's even hiding that well.<br><br>If the consensus is that today is mylo, we need to lynch Zhero; he is the most certain scum and the game hangs on getting this right, which means NOT lynching me for actually thinking about and analyzing the Rev/CD/Edos situation, even if you think I was dead wrong. If this isn't mylo and we can afford a mislynch, I'm not happy about it, but at least lynching me will show you that Zhero/CE are the ones who need to be eliminated.<br><br><br>Oh, and CooLDoG: it's rofl that freaking said that there are probably two scum with a daykill, and I don't want us to NL, so I don't know where you got that idea. I'm just happy we're not in mylo, dumbass--look, I can call people 'dumbass' too. Loving the tunnel vision, worked out real well for us yesterday, didn't it?"}

Yesterday and night were crazy for me.  <br><br>OK...so my thoughts the day's events (i.e. claims and votes and GETTING LOUD and all that):<br><br>We lose DGB...I'm not going to NK speculate (WIFOM and such)...and CoolDog immediately asks for a claim from Edo and Rev. <br><br>Questions in my mind regarding this...why was it so imperative that Edo and Rev claimed before you did CoolDog and if you were neighborized by Rev....why did you need him to claim and to claim before you?  What if Rev hadn't claimed first and on some odd stroke of luck someone else (scum?) HAD claimed neighborizer?  Slim odds yes...but you never know and you already \"knew\" Rev had neighborized you.  So I do not understand why you had Rev go before you.  As for Edo....what made you request Edo to claim?  The fact you just happened to call him out to claim and that he actually had one is also strange IMO.  You didn't really seem to be focused too much on EDO yesterday so why did he need to go first today <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"><br><br>Thoughts on CoolDog's claim.  I was leaning town towards him up to today...and as such, I'm leaning towards believing his claim.  I just don't understand it.  Also, there is nothing in his claim stopping him from being scum. <br><br>Edo's claim...JK.  He says he JK'd CoolDog N1....CoolDog claims to not have received a result N1...and CoolDog got a no gun on Edo N2 (which brings up the question again as to why Edo needed to claim????).  If CoolDog is town...this absolutely clears Edo (for the no gun moreso than the N1 block).  If by some chance CoolDog WAS scum....it would be an indication of Edo's alignment either way...he could be scum or town.<br><br>And Rev is a neighborizer.  I'm not sure I've ever been in a game with a scum neighborizer but I know they exist.  But based on personal experience I would have to say they are a lot less likely to be scum than town.  So IMO that means it is much more likely than not that Rev IS telling the truth.  He claims to have neighbored CoolDog N1 (conf by CD) and iirc, CE N2.  The fact he neighbored them is of no indication at all towards their alignment.<br><br>So between the three claims....it's a tossup between Edo and Rev IMO as to which is more believable.  Of the three...the one most likely to be fake IMO is CoolDog's.  NOTE TO COOLDOG:  I AM NOT SAYING YOUR CLAIM ISN'T LEGIT.....I'M SAYING OF THE THREE...IT HAS THE MOST LATITUDE TO BE FAKE.<br><br>And now CoolDog has annointed Zhero as town.  Great...so from CoolDog's POV there are three scum within Rest, CE, ROFL and me. <br><br>I agree with ROFL that it's probably MYLO.  I need to catch up in my other three games today as well.  I'll try to post again here tonight or tomorrow but I'm in no rush to vote ATM.  <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Claim:   I'm a JOAT.</span>  I have 1-shot watch, track and cop abilities.<br><br>N1 Shepherd copped Cheery Dog and got a not guilty.<br>N2 I tracked Zhero and he went nowhere.<br>I still have a watch left.<br><br>And if someone could actually make a case against Rest I would be interested in seeing it."}

Same level of towniness as CD, and pretty much can only be scum if CD is scum, and vice versa. Nothing fun to mention about these two. I think they're pretty safe, scum will probably kill one of them tonight. ConfTown by a mile. <br><br>CoolDog - Im pretty sure he's confirmed at this point, and with the drama at the beginning of this day/claims, I think it only solidifies my read on him. <br><br>Zhero - post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4721587#p4721587\">686</a> got a lot of town points from me, I liked how he was so unsure of this lynch when I had joined onto him, his skepticalness makes me think that he's actually thinking about this game. Though while back when we had fitz still alive, Zhero would've had two votes on him, and with fitz being a scum, I find it really hard to believe that with Fitz on, all scum needed was one more vote to get Zhero lynched, makes me think Zhero is actually scum as well. Though this whole thing is can't be conclusive, we 1) don't know how many scum there is, and 2) don't know the alignment of Rev.<br><br>roflcopter -Rofl never post reads, but he's been correct about most of them so far, Fitz was indeed a scum in his set of scum-ables. And we'll wait to see what Rest flips. I still can't read rofl and how he plays.<br><br>Rev - He's right now the scummy-est to me. He's flat out defending Rest while the rest (HAHA, im so punny) of us finds him scummy, he's been trying to put votes and pressure on EVERYBODY other than him. He's even tried to vote CD at the beginning of this day, someone who he sheep-ped yesterday, Now, I know he's claimed and conf- neighbourizer, but I don't know how \"bastard\" it is to have a scum neighbourizer...<br><br>Oh, and ...<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: RestFormata</span>"}

Both anti-town factions played very strong games, but Town were onto you by the end. Thanks to all the original players who stayed in through the whole game (Cheery Dog, Edosurist, CooLDoG, Revenus, Zhero, roflcopter, and RestFermata), and thanks to all those who replaced in and finished the game (Konowa, captaineddie, havingfitz, I Am Innocent, Norlkaz, and DrippingGoofball).<br><br>The game was hanging in the balance in Day 4: if Revenus had been hammered and roflcopter not targeted by a kill from the Mafia, he would essentially hold the game in his hands in the 1v1v1 LYLO (he would have to shoot captaineddie, but not Zhero, to win). Unfortunately, the lynch swung onto roflcopter instead.<br><br>The setup, in my opinion, turned out very nicely indeed. My aim was to make it a low-power Normal, but one which held a certain degree of intrigue, which would keep players interested, and I think I succeeded (although as my reviewers will attest, it took a gruelling few months to work the setup out). I was very happy that I got comments from people via PM praising me on the setup. A good indicator that it was balanced is that it ended up making it to 3p LYLO despite no power roles dying until very late. So there were no broken role interactions, either.<br><br>Thanks for making this a fun, interesting game to mod and, hopefully, to play. See you next time!<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.1in\"></span>"}
