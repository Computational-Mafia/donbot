The site-wide rules apply. Read them and then do not break them. Some of them are so important they're listed here as well, because redundancy is your friend.<br>\n2. Play to win. Most players want to win legitimately, don't ruin their enjoyment by playing against your wincon.<br>\n3. If you have the ability to edit or delete your posts in this thread, don't do it.<br>\n4. Do not quote anywhere any PMs between you and me (including role PMs), or anything else that originated outside of the game thread. This includes PM timestamps and anything else which games the system. Paraphrasing is allowed. If in doubt, ask.<br>\n5. Do not use cryptography, invisible text, tiny text, or anything like that.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">6. Do not impersonate or pretend to be the moderator. Blue is my color, don't use it or anything close to it.</div><br>\n7. Unless the moderator has specifically told you it is allowed, do not talk about this game outside of this game thread or PTs I provide you until I have announced that the game is over.<br>\n8. Do not bring outside factors into this game. This includes, among other things, making bets, promises of real life rewards, etc.<br>\n9. Do not use any form of provable randomness. Claiming you rolled dice and acting on that is fine. Using dice tags is not.<br>\n10. Pretending to break a rule will be treated the same as breaking the rule. It's up to my discretion whether I think you pretended to break or rule or not, so if you're not sure, ask first.<br>\n11. We're all here to have fun. Tempers may flare, but avoid personal attacks and keep it civil. I will have very little tolerance if someone complains about the way you're talking to them.<br>\n12. Breaking one of these rules may, at my discretion, result in a modkill. If you are modkilled, you will become a Neutral Survivor, and thus automatically lose. Modkilling may or may not end the game day.<br>\n13. I reserve the right to change the rules. Rule changes will be updated here as well as posted in thread.<br>\n14. If you are dead, that is it. Do not post. Not even a \"Bah\" post.<br>\n15. If I happen to not be online but you know the game is over (for example, if scum get a quicklynch in during LyLo), please let me post the final scene before revealing the ending or otherwise discussing the game.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Voting Rules</div></div><br>\n1. Votes must be bolded, and in the format of VOTE: Player, using either the bold or the vote tags. Abbreviations, missing punctuation, and misspellings will be accepted as long as it is obvious to me who is being voted for. IMPORTANT: If I perceive it as a vote, it counts as a vote, even if it doesn't follow these rules exactly!<br>\n2. Unvoting is nice, but is not necessary.<br>\n3. You may vote to No Lynch, that requires the same number of votes as a lynch vote.<br>\n4. Once a majority of votes is reached (# of players / 2 + 1, rounded down), that person is lynched.<br>\n5. All living players, including the lynchee, may continue to post until I lock the thread.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Activity Rules. Read these, I'm anal about them. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":!:\" title=\"Exclamation\"> <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":!:\" title=\"Exclamation\"> <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":!:\" title=\"Exclamation\"></div></div><br>\n1. If a player goes 48 real life hours (see rule #4 under Deadlines) without posting, I will prod them. Prods will be announced in thread.<br>\n2. If a player does not respond to their prod within 24 real life hours, or is prodded three times in total within the game, I will seek a replacement. 3. If the player comes back before a replacement is found I may allow them to continue. If this occurs when there is only one scum left in the game, or any other combination of roles which would clearly identify someone's alignment if something happens, I will extend the deadline until a replacement is found and can be given time to catch up (usually 24 hours). Other extensions will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.<br>\n4. If you will be V/LA, please alert me in the thread. Don't PM me, don't post in the V/LA thread, post in this thread. Otherwise I'll probably prod and possibly replace you.<br>\n5. The 48 hours on the weekends count as 24 hours for activity, give or take. I'm not going to let people slide by posting once towards the end of Friday and then again on late Monday without a prod. - See Deadline Rule 4 for additional information<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Deadlines.</div></div><br>\n1. Day one and two will have a deadline of fourteen real life days. Subsequent days will have a deadline of ten real life days.<br>\n2. In the event deadline is reached before a lynch has occurred, a No Lynch occurs.<br>\n3. The 48 hours on the weekends count as 24 hours for activity, give or take. I'm not going to let people slide by posting once towards the end of Friday and then again on late Monday without a prod.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Game Setup</div></div><br>\nThis game has been approved for normalcy and balance.

I feel like if he was new to the forum, he would go to the newbie queue to test the waters and see what the forum is like.

In post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=42#p42\">#42</a> he dislikes my play because of some claim, he believes it is hiding a villainous intent.  But in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=80#p80\">#80</a> he believes a doctor claim implicitly!  It is interesting!  It is not enough for me to change my suspicions yet, but I am confused at the inconsistency.  If he believes that the evil men would shoot a claimed doctor then should he not ignore the claim?  It feels as if he is trying to determine if Dwlee is a veteran!  <br>\n<br>\nThis would make them most certainly not evil together, unless evil has concocted a plot beyond my ken, so it is confusing!

{"number": 94, "id": "7450827", "user": "bji", "user_id": "25099", "content": "Hey all.  I see things are happening quickly, me likes.  It's been a while since I played this game, and I don't have much experience to begin with, so apologies in advance for being pretty stupid.<br>\n<br>\nFirst impressions (in order of posts as I see them):<br>\n<br>\n1. I don't understand this whole \"role play\" business or why it's important.  I didn't understand why claiming an ice cream flavor (which I presume to be vanilla) would be \"committed to roleplay to the point of absurdity\" (as per golden009 <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7446817#p7446817\">post 25</a>).  Does role playing typically require making an early claim?  Also, is there some way in which role playing is relevant to the game that I don't understand because it just seems like noise to me at this point.<br>\n<br>\n2. I didn't understand this phrase from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7446817#p7446817\">post 44</a>: \"pls -pm 11 your roles.\"  Can someone translate this to English?  Is this a call to some action?<br>\n<br>\n3. RolePlay25 is certainly interesting.  Such deft chains of logic belying significant mafia experience, but doesn't know what OMGUS means.  In my experience you cannot get through a game of mafia on this site without, by the end, knowing what OMGUS means if you didn't already.  So my conclusion is, like others, that RolePlay25 has significant experience with mafia in some form or other, but not on this site.  Also, RolePlay25 - do you have a pronoun preference?  If not, I'm just going to call you 'he'.  Thanks.<br>\n<br>\n4. RC is noncommittal.  Just wants to be sure everyone knows she's town, little else, unless there's something significant I don't understand from (2).<br>\n<br>\n5. Posts 63 - 67 were super interesting.  goldeneye009 falsely claims L-1 on RolePlay.  Dwlee99 falesely hammers.  Jake jumps right on that and says \"no you don't\".  Then Dwlee99 announces that he was just reaction testing, and then golden009 notes that Dwlee99 already voted anyway, so even if it WAS L-1 it wouldn't have counted.  Some questions:<br>\n  a. Dwlee99, if you thought your reaction test had value, why not let it go and see what came of it, even given Jake's posting?  I mean if you're reaction testing, I'd think you'd want to see some reactions.  Maybe people would have something to say about you, given what you'd done.  Don't you care what people think about you?  Wouldn't you care about people's feeling about anyone other than RolePlay25 if you were really scum hunting?<br>\n  b. golden009, did you intentionally fake claim L-1?  If so, did you get the outcome you wanted?  If not, how do you justify being so careless with an early L-1 claim?<br>\n<br>\n6. To answer <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7446817#p7446817\">post 80</a>: I joined last Xmas as something to do when I was sick in bed with bronchitis.  I had a tremendously fun first game and worked my way up to normal queues.  However my experiences quickly started to be less enjoyable as I a) started taking the game too seriously, including getting frustrated with pace of play, and b) ran into some frustrating situations such as games in which someone purposefully threw the game at the last minute, and also a game in which someone self-hammered as doctor just out of spite, and I started to find that I was more annoyed at the game of mafia than I was having fun, so I quit.  That was in May 2015.  So I decided to try again just recently because I guess my memory of the fun parts has now eclipsed my memory of the bad parts.  That seems to happen with hindsight in my experience.  Anyway, total experience, 5 games or so, two newbie, three mini normal, plus this one.<br>\n<br>\n7. The two most active players are RolePlay25 and Dwlee99, active to the point of numerous back-and-forth exchanges.  This early, I would conclude TvT.

I'm leaning towards town as I'm not 100% sure he would be ballsy enough to claim OMGUS with a game filled with new players; they might not think he's joking and pressure him hard because the wiki lists it as a scumtell. His reaction test seems town-motivated enough; a newbscum could have easily given up their identity since they don't really know about twilight trolling.</div></blockquote><br>\nWould not his preemptive noting of his own villainous behavior serve to deflect people from the consequences of his own villainous behavior?  <br>\n<br>\nI do understand the reaction test, based on the behavior of a villain in another game, so that makes sense to me.

Still, I do not give credence.  <br>\n<br>\nI have another question!  Supercool has voted me ostensibly because he did not believe my \"claim\".  In post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=42#p42\">#42</a> he dislikes my play because of some claim, he believes it is hiding a villainous intent.  But in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=80#p80\">#80</a> he believes a doctor claim implicitly!  It is interesting!  It is not enough for me to change my suspicions yet, but I am confused at the inconsistency.  If he believes that the evil men would shoot a claimed doctor then should he not ignore the claim?  It feels as if he is trying to determine if Dwlee is a veteran!  <br>\n<br>\nThis would make them most certainly not evil together, unless evil has concocted a plot beyond my ken, so it is confusing!  But it is also inconsistent!</div></blockquote><br>\nMy theory is that supercool wasn't serious. I think the doctor claim was made as a joke by Dwlee 99.99% and I think it was clear a player would not claim a PR so early in the game.<br>\nI have a question for you; what do you think about Golden?

RP is certainly role playing and...</div> You know what, I think you just made me have a revelation. I think I might be getting tripped up by how RP is role playing and that may be causing me to think he is faking noob. RP is clearly not a noob, so back then my thought process was \"there is no real town motivation to acting as a noob\" but then I realized that he would probably be role playing as either alignment (causing me to think he is faking noob as either alignment) since his name goes with his playstyle so perfectly.<br>\n<br>\nAs for golden, I believe him to actually be a noob, and I think I got a sort of gut town feel to him. I also was thinking that if RP and golden were both scum, they probably wouldn't want to be interacting this early in the game, so I figured the one I scumread would be the one who took up a scum slot. I think for golden I was leaning mainly on that associative tell I had going in my mind, so now that I don't have that anymore he could plausibly be scum imo.<br>\n<br>\nI think my reads might be screwed up.", "time": "Mon Dec 07, 2015 3:45 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64492&start=150", "forum": "53", "thread": "64492"}

It is immersive!  I always dislike how town of salem is not an immersive experience!  <br>\n<br>\nSecond, I believe my previous post should answer this!<br>\n<br>\nThe third point seems rhetorical.  I do not see as it helps!<br>\n<br>\nThe fourth point, I believe my previous post should answer this!  <br>\n<br>\nThe fifth point, I am not understanding.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThe third and fourth points are linked. It seems like the only reason you suspect Keyser is because of a clearly sarcastic \"I like your style\" quote. On the fifth point, it seems like the only reason you've stopped suspecting Dwlee is because he stopped suspecting you. Is there any other reason besides him stopping tunneling (even though the \"tunneling\" was less severe then what you're saying). <br>\n<br>\nAlso, what I'm talking about in that second point is your first post in the thread, where you say you suspect supercool. Of course, you don't actually vote which means that that's a useless, no-read piece of information.<br>\n<br>\nOn other people:<br>\nKeyser seems townish, although I'm automatically wary of votes for me.<br>\nI can't get much of a read on Dwlee at this point. Scum Dwlee and Town Dwlee could both do the exact posts that he's made in this game and they'd both have legitimate trains of thought.

Dwlee99 and RolePlay25 were clearly the frontrunners in that category with numerous postings and clear thought processes.

At the bottom we have people posting less and/or not looking very aggressive.<br>\n<br>\n\"Seems sincere\" is believability.  Note that RolePlay25 and Dwlee99 dropped down on that list compared to the first.  I always have the suspicion of an early bus just to throw everyone off, so there's that.  RadiantCowbells is at the bottom because this style of just throwing out zingers is always suspicious to me.<br>\n<br>\n\"Heebie Jeebies\" is a ranking of people whom I feel most likely to be able to or be in the process of trying to manipulate the game and/or other players.  Keyser Soze was scaring me at the time because there was something just too cold and calculating in his approach, although since then I've warmed up a bit on him and he'd no longer be at the top of that list.  This ranking takes into consideration the apparent experience and skill level I perceive in players, as I feel that more experienced players are more likely to be able to manipulate the game as scum.<br>\n<br>\nI included Bloodking and Diego even though there's almost nothing to go on with their posts, for completeness and because I thought it would take longer to explain why they weren't on the list than it would to just include them.", "time": "Tue Dec 08, 2015 5:51 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64492&start=175", "forum": "53", "thread": "64492"}

I told you, I strongly dislike how Supercool has spent today largely posting speculation that does not reflect whether I am good or evil!  It is a convenient mechanism for avoiding commenting while posting more than our friends Diego and Bloodking, who are generating attention through their own absence!  <br>\n<br>\nAdditionally!  His latest reads list is an improvement, but only marginally so!  You are active, therefore you are town.  Dwlee is active, therefore he is town.  No one is calling for bji to die, therefore he is town, but there's a trapdoor there.  Also from the edit, which I assume is based on the \"new post\" screen you receive after hitting submit (am I correct?) it took him four hours to assemble that post!  Does that feel like a four hour post?  To me it does not.  That is a long time to spend for a post that contains very little.  After speculating on me the entire game, he cannot read me!  He forgot what he wanted to write about Neumune, since his speculation stops in the middle!  Instead of organic, this appears heavily contrived.  <br>\n<br>\nIt appears his primary tool for locating evil guys is volume of posts.  This is convenient!  Post volume is a hard fact that cannot be questioned!  If you have not posted much you have a low one!  MarioMaker must post more to become even more good!  But could not evil use that to simply kill people with low post volumes?  Although in any mystery we must inevitably eliminate suspects who do not appear, I am not so quick as to say that those who speak are those who are good and those who do not are those who are evil.<br>\n<br>\nHe has rolled over, sat up, and begged on your command!  Does his obedience and the results make him good or evil for you?<br>\n<br>\nI do not dislike Golden's death.

I told you, I strongly dislike how Supercool has spent today largely posting speculation that does not reflect whether I am good or evil!  It is a convenient mechanism for avoiding commenting while posting more than our friends Diego and Bloodking, who are generating attention through their own absence!  <br>\n<br>\nAdditionally!  His latest reads list is an improvement, but only marginally so! <div style=\"font-size: 200%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"> You are active, therefore you are town. </div> Dwlee is active, therefore he is town.  No one is calling for bji to die, therefore he is town, but there's a trapdoor there.  Also from the edit, which I assume is based on the \"new post\" screen you receive after hitting submit (am I correct?) it took him four hours to assemble that post!  Does that feel like a four hour post?  To me it does not.  That is a long time to spend for a post that contains very little.  After speculating on me the entire game, he cannot read me!  He forgot what he wanted to write about Neumune, since his speculation stops in the middle!  Instead of organic, this appears heavily contrived.  <br>\n<br>\nIt appears his primary tool for locating evil guys is volume of posts.  This is convenient!  Post volume is a hard fact that cannot be questioned!  If you have not posted much you have a low one!  MarioMaker must post more to become even more good!  But could not evil use that to simply kill people with low post volumes?  Although in any mystery we must inevitably eliminate suspects who do not appear, I am not so quick as to say that those who speak are those who are good and those who do not are those who are evil.<br>\n<br>\nHe has rolled over, sat up, and begged on your command!  Does his obedience and the results make him good or evil for you?<br>\n<br>\nI do not dislike Golden's death.

His analysis when it finally came seems rational, if not a little predictable.<br>\n<br>\nDiego: I predict a replace-out.<br>\n<br>\nDwlee99: Showed alot of eagerness early, posting every few minutes and actively involved in back and forth exchanges, especially with RolePlay25, and then kind of petered out.  The reaction test seemed careless and unnecessary, not likely to produce a good outcome for town or scum, so null but puzzling.  Seems a little fixated on RC later in the game.<br>\n<br>\ngolden009: Very quick to assign scum motivations early.  Expressed lots of confusion about Dwlee99's fake hammer but then just kind of lost interest in it.<br>\n<br>\nKeyser Soze: Quick jump off the RolePlay25 wagon, I want to believe it was sincere but could be trying to squeeze some town cred out of leaving a wagon that he knew would not end in a hammer anyway (because who hammers in the first few hours of day 1?  Does that *ever* happen?).  Most of his posts question others' consistency or sincerity, so clearly believes that scum can be detected by looking for inconsistencies or insincerities.  I can find no clear fault with anything Keyser has done.<br>\n<br>\nMarioManiac4: Has posted very little aside from some early suspicion of Golden.  Lack of continued posting despite more ammunition for his position on Golden having come around since (as there have been many more postings by or discussing Golden and Mario certainly has had ample opportunity to refine his position and tell us about it), leads me to believe that he's a bit AWOL at the moment.<br>\n<br>\nNeumune: About the only strong conclusion I can come to is that this player clearly doesn't like \"Town of Salem\", whatever that is.<br>\n<br>\nRadiantCowbells: Has done very little except fake claim.  If I recall from prior experience, this is not unusual for town RC, which is the only RC I've ever played with.<br>\n<br>\nRolePlay25: Gets alot of criticism for his style, but persists, which I actually appreciate.  Some want to brand this 'anti-town', but I see it as wanting to have fun and play the game on his own terms and not letting anyone discourage him.  Is either very diligently scumhunting, or is trying very hard to appear that he is, and I see no reason to conclude it's the latter.<br>\n<br>\nsupercool898: Seemed very reasonable, up to post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7452519#p7452519\">161</a>.  The first paragraph gives a very unconvincing  argument for backing away from a suspicion of RolePlay25 (\"his role playing threw me\").  Otherwise, seems just fine.<br>\n<br>\nTheCow: Hasn't posted alot, seems fine.  One of the \"suspicious of Golden\" crowd.<br>\n<br>\nOne of the only clear conclusions from reading everyone's ISO is that Golden is in hot water.  A large percentage of players claim to be suspicious of Golden.  I personally do not see it; most of the suspicion seems to center around Golden not voting for his top scumread all of the time, and otherwise not pushing on people that he claims to have some suspicions of, but I don't feel these are necessarily scummy behaviors.  They could just as easily be the result of taking a more cautious approach.  I for one can identiy with this as I have a very hard time mustering any convictions given how easily it is to conclude WIFOM on everything.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, I feel like we have some players of superior experience and talent here, and they are Keyser Soze and RolePlay25.  I am constantly seeing, through their comments, stuff that I didn't see in my own reading.

The responsibilities of a King.  You may buck it or accept it, but in this moment, now, you are King.  Machiavelli said it is better to be feared than loved!  But he spoke further on this as well.  A King naturally inspires fear, even when they do not wish to do so.  The King speaks with Authority!  If the King speaks, then everyone shall listen! <br>\n<br>\nShall I give you an example?  Despite having spoken nothing of him for quite some time, Lord Golden remains the primary target of this gathering, through deed if not word.  Because the King's edict remains on Lord Golden.  Were you to remove your edict, it would be like a dam had burst open!  The wave would flood forth!  You can feel that pressure, bottled behind your edict.   Push, command, gather us, and the waters shall rise, drown Lord Golden in their murky depths. <br>\n<br>\nYou can also feel the responsibilities of the crown!  Overused, your edict fades in worth.  It loses its authority. You are not a leader of battle, galloping to and from, leading a raucous mob of vigilantes in a tide of violence!  You are the thoughtful leader, your decisions must have weight.<br>\n<br>\nYou can feel the dangers of the crown!  To determine villains, we look to what is forced, what flows unnaturally, what cracks peek through.  But a King commands fear, Kaiser.  Your subject Supercool was compelled to produce a list, compelled by a King!  He did so, but he did so poorly.  It is forced.  That is easy to recognize.  Is it forced because the orders of a King or the need to appear as a hero?  Is the fear that seeps from every pore of his words the fear of a villain on the verge of discovery, or the fear of a subject to the might of the King's edict?  <br>\n<br>\nYour kingdom has a Fool! One who fears not the King, who speaks indirectly, but with piercing intent.  A Fool bedevils a King!  A Fool does not feel the fear a King is due, does not bend at the knee, does not follow the King's rules.  He mocks the King!  He laughs at the King!  His presence might threaten to undermine the King's authority!  You ask yourself, \"Do I have this Fool executed?  He obeys no rules, follows no authority.  He undermines me by his very presence.  A nation of fools would be impossible to rule.\"<br>\n<br>\nBut I say to you, a good King listens to his Fool.  A Fool's words bear no weight.  The reaction to them is natural.  The Fool may garner a truth through his japes that a King cannot with orders and shouting.  <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nCome, Kaiser.  Let me ask something of you.  There are three men you trust in all of the world.  Three lone, solitary men.  One of them you trust because of a mishap, a fluke, that leads you to believe in his character.  Two of them you trust because their logic and deductions seem strong, because they provide you insight that is invaluable.  You can picture this, right?  Those two men you trust the judgment and skill of, they both say the same thing.  They both tell you that one particular man, Lord Golden, is a villain.  You too believe Lord Golden is a villain.  What do you do?  I think it is obvious.<br>\n<br>\nIs that enough to convince you that that list was created by a villain?

If nothing else, at least a summary, because I'm too tired to try to work through what you mean.<br>\n<br>\nBLOODKING (Don't know where the numbers are, don't particularly care) seems to have forced reads, probably due to his lack of presence up to that point. Three town reads, three scum reads, a lot of null reads.

Thinking scum for now, just because there isn't much in his posts to work with.<br>\n<br>\nDwlee's posts seem reactionary in nature, rather than analytical. This seems to fit with his personality and past posts in other games. Seems \"carefree\" - not sure how to put it, but he doesn't look like he has anything to worry about at the moment. Reaction test seemed useless, but he seems genuine in how he tried to use it, so that's nice.

I liked the old you better.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAlas, I liked the old me better too.  I shall endeavor to return to that style at some point, but first a clarification:  It is not your methodology that I find grating.  Indeed, I believe it would be my duty to speak up immediately if I found it so!  The list was indeed, as you say, an energetic attempt to - instead of a single axis prosaic good-evil morality (nearly worthless without information) - provide a more balanced approach that weighed motive, goals, and an unknown but pertinent \"X factor\" representing your best guess as to how likely a player was to be able to \"pull the wool over your eyes\".  I could offer some quibbles, but that does not serve the purpose of the list.  So this is not my concern!  This is not my inquiry!  <br>\n<br>\nThe question, BJI, is \"where has your methodology taken you?\"  It is unreasonable and absurd to demand a hero provide immediate returns.  To assess the character of 12 individuals, sift good from evil, these are activities that are an ongoing process.  One does not classify all 12 quickly, one must change one's classifications as the need arises.

I desire such too.

There are three players this game that I feel have had a very similar level of involvement and have asked a very similar level of probing questions: you, RolePlay, and Acryon.  I would expect someone who has evaluated two as town to evaluate the third the same way.  It feels a little forced to pick one to drop out of the town read list so that someone else can be pulled in.  Feels more like being afraid of sheeping than making coherent reads to me.<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, I found the phrasing a little weird: \"So it's kinda interesting how our reads are almost polar opposite\".  This was followed by a partial reads list in which <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">nothing</div> was the \"polar opposite\" of Bloodking's reads.  This is another thing that felt off and forced to me.  The fear of appearing to be sheeping is strong in this one.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, why is my question \"slapping Malakittens across the face\"?

Were I to note that a game of mine recently completed in which a player named ActionDan replaced in and immediately began to lurk.  The reason for such was not \"he liked country music\" but \"he expected to be aligned with the town, and was not\".  Sadly it appears I will never ever ever receive further information about that player, so am unsure as to how to proceed.  Do we kill not on evidence, but the eternal promise that nothing resembling content shall ever arise from the slot?  The vote on super, for instance is slotted under \"explain later\" but it appears that \"later\" has become a synonym for \"never\".  And yet a vote with no reason still contributes to death.  <br>\n<br>\nOther than that, I am very extremely content with my vote on FrozenAngel.   I still would not mislike the death of Golden.

Also I view RVS a bit differently than a lot of people on this site (at least who I have played with). I believe that people exit RVS individually. For example (hypothetical situation), half the people in a game could provide enough content to make basic reads on each other, but the other half could not have posted yet due to timezones or whatever. At that point, votes made towards the inactive players would be RVS, while votes made to active players would be non-RVS", "time": "Mon Dec 14, 2015 7:31 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64492&start=600", "forum": "53", "thread": "64492"}

I can reveal the reason for my vote.<br>\n<br>\nIt's quite simple.  Frozen Angel and RolePlay were bussing.  I voted Frozen to put more pressure on her, hoping that if others piled on, we'd be able to see how much RolePlay really wanted to lynch her.  I didn't want to tell my reasons then, because it would completely ruin any chance of getting an accurate read on RolePlay's intentions.<br>\n<br>\nSo how do I know that they were bussing?  Consider:<br>\n<br>\n- RolePlay makes some random early pressure on several players and then settles on Bloodking with a trumped-up case that he pushes hard.  We've all seen how much RolePlay has \"tunnelled\" on the Bloodking/Frozen slot for most of the game by this point.  Even Frozen admitted it.<br>\n<br>\n- A reasonable explanation for this would be that RolePlay had agreed with Bloodking in scum pre-game chat to bus each other.  It's a decent strategy, my scum partner and I won our first game with the same approach.<br>\n<br>\n- But Bloodking goes AWOL.  RolePlay is left bussing someone who isn't bussing back.  This leaves RolePlay paralyzed because he has to keep bussing Bloodking on the assumption that he'll come back soon ... but Bloodking never comes back.  Now RolePlay is left a bit out to dry but ...<br>\n<br>\n- In comes Frozen to the rescue.  Posts a bunch of fluffy comments to look like scum hunting and then, as her first action after this, in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7471892#p7471892\">560</a>, tells RolePlay:<br>\n<br>\n\"come drect on me RolePlay\"<br>\n<br>\n- So why did she post this?  I'll tell you why.  Frozen has access to the scum pre-chat and was able to read Bloodking and RolePlay's communication and knew they wanted to bus, but now that it's day she can't talk directly to RolePlay and so had to communicate her intention to continue the bus strategy.  And there it was, in black and white.  \"come direct on me RolePlay\".<br>\n<br>\n- Immediately, RolePlay starts bussing her, hard.  And she busses back, with lots of emotion and drama.<br>\n<br>\nI started to get the feeling that there could be bussing here soon after these two started going at it, so I decided to make the game interesting by seeing if we could get Frozen close to L-1 and then see what RolePlay would do.  If he dropped off the wagon, that would be further evidence - he doesn't want to really lynch Frozen, so he has to start acting uncertain ... which HE DOES, right around post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7474108#p7474108\">715</a>.  RolePlay is starting to beg Keyser to give him a reason to leave the Frozen wagon!<br>\n<br>\nAnd Keyser doesn't play along; but RolePlay leaves anyway! <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7475485#p7475485\">778</a><br>\n<br>\nI am now 100% convinced that Frozen and RolePlay were bussing.

The first is quite tiresome and trite. I make a \"case\". Frozen Angel attacks every single element of this case, because that is how it is supposed to play out. A good guy makes a case, if it is good enough the bad guy dies. She wants such. She desires such. She is actively seeking to attack my case, regardless of its contents. She argues that none of my points on Bloodking had merit, that they all boiled down to attacking him for lurking. For those of you who were there, you know this is not my case. For those of you who were not, read.<br>\n<br>\nI prefer another method, perhaps this is from a bias that this site does not share. You read her posts, you see her raw need to latch onto a familiar framework of \"town vs. scum\" and you see how such framework she seeks places her as scum, and me as town. Like adults, like equals, we all make a judgment.<br>\n<br>\nTo me, it seems a waste of time to attempt to convince Frozen Angel she is a villain. She has known such since she replaced in. You know such by observation. Let us finish this.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nFrozen spent most of the day simply freaking out in response to your bus on her.  Everything she provided that day, you trashed as \"not really trying to scum hunt\" (to paraphrase).  Then Frozen left for a while (went to bed) in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7472829#p7472829\">704</a>.  Before she is even back, and without having posted anything new to change your mind about the sincerity of her scum hunting, you start feigning doubt in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7473973#p7473973\">712</a>.  And by <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7474757#p7474757\">736</a> you're in full-on \"I beg of you please tell me to vote for someone else\" mode.<br>\n<br>\nI don't buy it.<br>\n<br>\nBut, perhaps you can point out the posts that Frozen Angel made prior to post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7473973#p7473973\">712</a> that convinced you that she's not really scum but was sincerely scum hunting?  And perhaps you can explain why at the time that she posted them you continued to trash her posts as insincere, only to change your mind about them later?<br>\n<br>\nDear town: if you want to kill RolePlay today, instead of Frozen, I'm game.

I'm sorry to have to say this, but here's why I think Titus is doing this:<br>\n<br>\nTitus is some kind of \"den mother\" for a bunch of female players.  The evidence in is in Mini 1652.  She subbed in to replace a freaking out SilverWolf, and afterwards, admitted:<br>\n<br>\n\"No. I sub in a lot. I see one of my babies in trouble I protect them.\"<br>\n<br>\nI thought that was a weird thing to say at the time but I never said anything.  It gave me the impression that Titus feels like she is some kind of protector/supporter of a group of player that she believes are to some degree her responsibility.  She defended SilverWolf's actions in a very personal way, as if SilverWolf's was personally important to her.<br>\n<br>\nNow she's here, and all of her actions would seem to state that she doesn't really care much about playing this game, just about supporting another member of her cabal.<br>\n<br>\nShe comes in and immediately asks Mala who to vote for.<br>\n<br>\nShe doesn't scum hunt, pressure, really play at all.  She just sheeps Mala's vote.<br>\n<br>\nShe continues to cheerlead for the wagon that Mala is on.<br>\n<br>\nShe doesn't want to give any reasons for her vote, because there are no reasons, aside from solidarity with one of \"her babies\".<br>\n<br>\nNow, her personal relationship with these other players doesn't matter to me and I don't have a problem with it.  None of this is meant to be critical.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, I believe it does indicate that Titus has no actual interest in finding scum and has no actual reason to believe that supercool is scum.

I would love to ask RC more about what he is trying to do, but I don't think I'll get a straight answer, and I believe that RC thinks that not giving straight answers is part of his \"strategy\" here, so it's hopeless.  Let me say again that I don't believe his cop claim.  Everything about how that went down smelled bad to me.  The whole \"nobody take my target to L-1, because I'm so afraid that Titus might actually be lynched and I have no idea if she's really scum\" was a dead giveaway I thought.  The whole stringing everyone along with promised reads that he had no intention of ever giving (otherwise, why not just give them?  What all the melodrama surrounding giving the reads that people have been begging for since the first day of Day 1?), totally not believable.  If RC is a cop, then I'm a freaking Mafia Godfather.

Town, ask yourself: what benefit could it have for FA to make a claim here?  RC fakes a cop claim to try to get Titus lynched.  Clearly it's not going to happen, so when that fails he backs off and tries to use it as an opportunity to doubtcast me.  And for bonus points, why not try to get FA to reveal her role?<br>\n<br>\nLynch all liars.  RC has proven to be a liar over and over again.  His presence is only confusing things for town, which is probably the overall intention of his fake claim to begin with.  Ask yourself: do you feel that RC's fake claim helped to clarify things for town, or just provided noise and uncertainty?<br>\n<br>\nAnd let me reiterate: I am not a mafia godfather, or a mafia anything.  That was my attempt, perhaps ill-conceived, to point out how ridiculous RC's cop claim was.  And it was ridiculous, and I think that's obvious; why would a real cop ask that nobody put the supposedly fingered target at L-1?  Why would a real cop ask that everyone wait until some \"reads\" are posted before lynching the target, and so obviously string us along by giving excuses instead of the reads?  RC would have already had his reads ready to go if he really was cop and knew he was going to out himself.  And why would a real cop out themselves immediately at the beginning of day 2?  Such a transparent fake claim.<br>\n<br>\nGiven how RC played day 1, it was my conclusion that he simply likes to fuck with games.  How did any of his fake claiming day 1 help town?  And the fake cop claim, it just adds noise.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, RC seems to be emboldened by town's failure to act to make more obvious scum plays.  Like fishing for roles.<br>\n<br>\nLet me remind you of who hammered our doctor, by the way.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: RolePlay</span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: RadiantCowbells</span>", "time": "Sun Dec 20, 2015 5:57 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64492&start=1300", "forum": "53", "thread": "64492"}

Walk me through.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">THE FOLLOWING IS A WALL.  Sorry to piss people off.  But when you ask for my thought process RC, I'm going to give it.  In great detail.  It's just how I roll.</div><br>\n<br>\nI am V/LA and only have limited segments of each day to read/respond.  I will be out of V/LA by tomorrow.  I have been reading the thread but it's hard to keep up.  It's clear though that RC is trying to position either Titus or me for a lynch.<br>\n<br>\nFirst, I did not pick up on any RC cop crumbs or whatever.  I have never picked up on a crumb in any game I've ever played and I expect it would be some time before I'd ever have the experience to do so.  I also think that crumbing is kind of a dumb idea but that's a discussion for another time.<br>\n<br>\nSecond, I never picked up on any false trail that was an inno on me.  I don't really even know what something like that would look like.<br>\n<br>\nNow, as to what was going through my head, it's quite simple: I did read your fake claim but for the reasons I already stated, it looked like bunk to me.  I decided that you were either scum faking it to try to get Titus lynched, or really were town but were trying some kind of gambit.  Either way, I thought it was important that people not believe you, because if you're scum, well the reason is obvious, but if you're town, then the whole thing just kind of pissed me off.  Your play day 1 pissed me off, it gave me the feeling of a player who didn't really care about the game and was just fucking around.  I genuinely believed that you may be playing the game just for your own jollies, not paying attention, and mostly just reveling in the confusion you could cause.  Then the fake claim I thought looked like more of the same, and it pissed me off.  So I decided to challenge you on it.<br>\n<br>\nThen it felt like because I challenged you on it, you decided to choose me as your next target.  Although this was irritating it also made me start to maybe come around on choosing the town option on you.  I couldn't figure out why it would benefit you to switch to me like that, because it required that you give up on your fake claim \"early\" when it still had legs.  That made your actions seem more legitimate.  Still a gambit and still irritating because you're playing with town's patience, but at least it had town motivation.<br>\n<br>\nThen you got into the whole back and forth with Titus and to a lesser extent FA and it get really boring to read.  But I read it anyway, and in doing so, I noticed that you both explained how there is no reason for FA to hard claim, but a few posts later, also said that you really <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">needed</div> her to hard claim.  Something about that just struck me as odd, and I puzzled over it.  I came to the conclusion that you were trying to get her to claim because you had some role that she might also claim which would allow you to know that she was faking.  I thought it was an actual role, and you thought that maybe she was going to claim it, and you just needed her to hard claim it for your trap to be successful.  I did not think of something like a modifier like ascetic, which I wasn't even aware of until you said it and I had to go look it up.<br>\n<br>\nWith regards to trying to build a case against me, I see that it's mostly association with Titus, plus you really did believe that I claimed mafia godfather because apparently that fits into some theory of association between me and Titus.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">There is no association between me and Titus</div>.  And that fake claim I did was just to try to make a point, I was pissed off about what I thought was you fucking around with town and I went too far to try to make my point.  If I really was mafia I would never actually claim it like that, there would be no benefit to doing so and it would just be stupid.  And my point anyway was that I thought you were <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">not</div> a cop, which made the \"if you are a cop, then I am a mafia\" clearly not mean that I was claiming mafia.  I mean, \"if A, then B; not A\" is not an assertion that B is true.<br>\n<br>\nThe thing I don't understand, is why you (RC) are so ready to accept FA's reversal of her claim to know that you had a role.  To be honest when you go back and forth on people so frequently (FA is guilty; FA is innocent; Titus is mod confirmed town; Titus is scum) I really don't know what to believe about what you think because at any moment, you might just do a 180.<br>\n<br>\nI am going to keep my vote on FA.

Someone explain to me how that happened.<br>\n<br>\nSomeone also explain to me how two days in a row, RolePlay was instrumental in: weakening the wagon on FA when it got to L-2/L-1, and immediately driving the counter wagon to a mislynch?<br>\n<br>\nRolePlay posts <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7446817#p7446817\">925</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7476566#p7476566\">933</a>, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7476798#p7476798\">938</a> look to me like spreading doubt on the Frozen Angel wagon that was at L-2 at the time.  Not to mention the whole begging Keyser to give him a reason to leave the FA wagon which I already mentioned soon after it happened.  Then RolePlay joins the Supercool wagon, hard; we all saw how anxious he was to get super lynched at the end of Day 1.<br>\n<br>\nIn Day 2, RolePlay started out lumping RC and FA together.  See post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7493164#p7493164\">1478</a> where his town reads are \"Mario Maker. Cow. FA. RC. Titus.\"  They're right next to each other.  RolePlay made many statements indicating that he believed that both RC and FA were town who fake claimed (posts <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7493331#p7493331\">1483</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7493338#p7493338\">1484</a>).  RolePlay also clearly stated that Lynch All Liars cannot be applied mindlessly (see post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7495740#p7495740\">1797</a>, and even did a nice little flip-flop on FA to demonstrate this (post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7494557#p7494557\">1595</a>, followed by post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7494576#p7494576\">1604</a>, where he states that he <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">doesn't do policy lynches</div>)).  But then RolePlay <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">drives hard on a lynch of RC</div> solely for <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">lynch all liars</div> which is a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">policy lynch</div>.<br>\n<br>\nNow consider the end of Day 2 theatrics between RC and RolePlay.  RC we know was town, and had a good reason to be frustrated because he was quickly mislynched without being given an opportunity to defend himself (although I think we can all say that he brought it on himself with that awful gambit).  What reason did RolePlay have to be so vitriolic?  Could be frustrated town right?  But why lash out so hard at RC when he himself was part of the problem by not following his own stated policy of not doing policy lynches?<br>\n<br>\nRolePlay had essentially the same reason to vote FA and RC (because both were fake claiming).  He had them both right next to each other during his \"these two are town fake claiming\" period.  But instead of going after FA, he defended her and went after RC, then acted pissed off beyond any possible rational level of human behavior to cover himself going into Day 3.<br>\n<br>\nRolePlay is either scum or the worst town ever, and he didn't look inexperienced/dumb enough to me to be the worst town ever.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: itlepip</span><br>\n<br>\nAlso, I think it goes without saying, but no quick lynches please.

You seem to have changed your case to an Acryon/MM team), but I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">think</div> your case against Acryon is:<br>\n<br>\n1. He agreed with my associative theory putting you and RolePlay as a scum team based on your Day 1 interactions.<br>\n2. He, like RC, tried to push you to hard claim.<br>\n<br>\nIf there's more, please tell me, because these two points do not convince me, as follows:<br>\n<br>\nRegarding point 1: Your interaction with RolePlay <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">was</div></div> weird.  Although on Day 1 I could see what looked like you two subtly interacting, I haven't seen it since, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">except</div> in how RolePlay has treated your wagons; but I admit that this is something that RolePlay could be doing on his own as scum trying to make you look bad.  Either way, I don't see anything scummy about Acryon agreeing with my theory, because I still see weird interactions there, and why wouldn't Acryon agree?  To be frank, I'm kind of frustrated that <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">more</div> people haven't seen that interaction and agreed with my interpretation of it.<br>\n<br>\nRegarding point 2: Have you considered that perhaps Acryon has a role and was just as interested as RC in getting you to claim for the same reasons as RC?  Note that I'm not asking Acryon to reveal if this is true or not, but the fact that it's a possibility that you don't even seen to have recognized is ... weird.<br>\n<br>\nI looked back at your ISO to see if you had some points on Acryon that I hadn't considered, and this stood out:<br>\n<br>\nYour post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7478421#p7478421\">1017</a>:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><br>\nSupercool role fish.

Super flipped town, so clearly they weren't working together, at least not as a mafia team.  This evidence is now reduced from mafia-mafia cooperation to scum-Acryon shadowing town-Super.  Viewed in that light, it just looks like normal/random interaction that you might find between any two players.  And \"If I'm wrong about both of them being scum together I'm sure I'm right about at least one of them\" is not compelling logic.  It's not even a reason for anyone else to suspect Acryon, it's just a re-statement of how much you wanted to lynch one of Super or Acryon back before Super had even flipped.<br>\n<br>\nAlso that search results thing where you were trying to draw evidence from word counts in ISOs was just bad math.<br>\n<br>\nLike I said, if you have good reasons for voting Acryon, please point them out, as I can't find them.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@MM</div>: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Every</div> vote count has you on a golden wagon except the end of Day 2 votes where you alternated between Frozen Angel and RadiantCowbells.

I have never seen role fishing happen and I have no idea why scum would even try it.  You can't fish a role claim out of someone just by asking or pressuring them, it takes a L-1 vote and Acryon wasn't even voting you as a means to get that claim.

I blamed you for extending the gambit by continuing to hold to a fake claim instead of just admitting you fake claimed and bringing some order to that chaotic situation.

Even if there was no ascetic, there were all number of ways that could screw things up.  First, any cop, regardless of ascetic, would be instantly suspicious of you because you had by that point claimed to be some kind of cop.  Second, if RC had been lynched and had been a regular cop, you'd be looking really bad.  If you're scum then awesome job getting yourself lynched in a gambit, but if you're town, well then that's not helping anything.  Third, you had set yourself up to be pressured to reveal your information on RC and if RC had not been lynched and it could not be confirmed, then you'd basically have spread false information that doesn't help anything.  And, there are probably many more ways that this could screw things up that I'm not even thinking of.<br>\n<br>\nAs to the positives of your actions ... what were they?

In the meantime, their ISOs are so small that I guess I can read them and give some opinions ...<br>\n<br>\ngolden: The only weird thing in his early game was how interested he was in dwlee's faked quickhammer and then how little he actually pushed on dwlee for it or pursued it at all.  But golden clearly wasn't interested in doing any hard thinking this game so ... could be explained by that.  Also I don't like how he said \"I can't get much of a read on Dwlee\" in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7453148#p7453148\">175</a> despite basically having done very little to try to actively get dwlee to talk.  That's a fairly incongruous position.  Aide from that, he didn't seem very interested.  I got the feeling that he was skimming posts, and commenting on whatever popped out at him without really putting much thought into anything.  Useless slot, but not necessarily scum.  Without more participation though I guess we'll never know, until he is lynched/killed or end-gamed.<br>\n<br>\nTheCow: minor participation.  Felt like he was putting a little more effort in than golden, but not a whole lot more.  However, on reread TheCow's interactions with both lynched players is really bad:<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7450852#p7450852\">95</a>: \"supercool898 is half way between lost and confused town, and scum for me right now.\"  What?  How can a player be halfway between lost and confused town, but still scum?  And in the end, he <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">was</div> town.  So this looks like an opportunistic (and clumsy) effort to justify voting for someone that TheCow knew was town but wanted to vote for anyway.  In the end he voted supercool with no explanation at L-3 which is a very comfy place to park a vote with little suspicion, and left it there until super was mislynched.  Never explained the vote at all, ever.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7490368#p7490368\">1291</a>: \"titus wagon was full of lulz, counter wagon was full of tears and thats all of the productive input from me for the next two weeks folks\"  So TheCow is basically saying that he doesn't intend to read/participate in the next two weeks (presumably due to the holidays) because he won't be giving \"productive input\".  However, he joined the quickwagon on RC and hammered that slot just a few days later.  This implies that he either a) was lying about whether or not he was going to be reading/participating, and had been reading really closely and made careful considerations of his vote, or b) didn't read carefully and just decided to quickhammer RC.  I personally feel it is much more likely to be (b) due to the subsequent postings by TheCow that indicate that he isn't reading and doesn't care much.<br>\n<br>\nYeah TheCow is looking really bad to me right now.  He's been just sliding through basically unnoticed, except to contribute to the first mislynch, and also to suddenly be confident enough about his reading of the game to quickhammer RC.  That's the kind of thing I can totally see a scum who doesn't really want to play and doesn't mind being a \"sacrificial\" member of the scum team whose only major contribution was to get on mislynch wagons and to quickhammer experienced town players.<br>\n<br>\nMalakittens: second least participatory member.  Who was the very least participatory member?  Diego, the slot that she took over.  How strange that the same slot should have gotten the two least participatory members in the game.  At this point, with so little go on in from her posts, it's hard to try to draw any conclusion that wouldn't just be pure speculation along the lines of \"scum happy to watch the mislynches happen without even having to lift a finger\".<br>\n<br>\nOK so at this point in the game, and until someone else actually contributes something that changes my mind, my top two lynch candidates for the day are: the RolePlay/itlepip slot, and TheCow.  If anyone has a preference for who we should lynch between those two, please say so.  At this time I prefer TheCow.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: TheCow</span>", "time": "Thu Dec 31, 2015 6:40 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64492&start=2000", "forum": "53", "thread": "64492"}

Marcrell has cleansed the slot a bit with more reasonable play, but it's still my top scum read.<br>\n<br>\nI have historically had as my other scum read the RolePlay slot (now occupied by Aquanim).  Aquanim's style has been so different from RolePlay's that it's hard to have a consistent read on that slot however and Aquanim has managed to take some of the edge off of my convictions against that slot.<br>\n<br>\nI agree with others that FA's play is hard to categorize.  Her play seems sincere (town) but is also combative and nonproductive (anti-town).  On the whole though although I have had reservations about particular actions (interactions with RolePlay slot and fake claiming), I have a town read on her.<br>\n<br>\nYour slot has given us so little to work with that it's really hard to come to any conclusions about it.  You're going to be under the microscope now so please make your contributions count.  If you're town, you really need to convince us and to help town out by adding clarity and strong reads/argumenst to the game.  If you're scum ... then please be sure to post alot, it will help us pin you down.<br>\n<br>\nI find Acryon in general to have played in a very straightforward town style, and most or all of his actions have obvious town motivations.  He is either town or very good at acting town.  For the time being, I believe the former.  The flips of several players would weigh heavily into my thoughts on Acryon though, should those flips happen.<br>\n<br>\nDwlee makes short posts that are reasonable but often quite devoid of strong statements.  I have yet to see Dwlee push on anyone, or really appear to make much of an effort beyond responding to what other people say.  He did the fake hammer thing early on which I have already stated can be interpreted with either town or scum motivations, but I do lean scum on it.  Actually scanning his ISO a bit, I have to wonder why, after all of the questions Dwlee has asked of other players, why has he never formed a particularly strong read on anyone?  I would be comfortable calling this slot tied with Aquanim as second place to Marcrell on my scum reads at the moment.<br>\n<br>\nI also really don't like Mala's interaction with Dwlee.  From her first (and only?) reads list (post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7466022#p7466022\">497</a>):<br>\n<br>\n\"I feel the whole reaction test thing was more town leaning than scum [<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I think it was more scum leaning than town</div>] I don't see what motivation scum would have to do this [<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">for town cred, obviously</div>], and I feel like scum would be paying more attention to the vote count the he was [<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">this is a silly argument, because scum would have to pay attention just to vote count just to be able to pull off a fake hammer</div>]. While his activity level is high I don't think his content reflects this it feels like he is just here interacting with people which isn't really wither alignment for me as this could be scum trying to seem active or a town actually just trying to converse with people. As for his reads so far they seem null to me.\"<br>\n<br>\nMala liked it when Keyser expressed concern about Dwlee (post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7466022#p7466022\">497</a>).  <br>\n<br>\nMala put Dwlee in as a town read with no further explanation post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7446817#p7446817\">498</a>.  Where did this read come from?  Nobody questioned it through, so Mala has sailed through with an unexplained town read on Dwlee (post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7472685#p7472685\">687</a>, post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7518107#p7518107\">2004</a>) all the way through a re-statement of her only conclusions about the game being that Dwlee and FA are town (post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7534989#p7534989\">2152</a>).<br>\n<br>\nI sense a connection between these two slots.  I could be convinced to lynch one of Dwlee or Mala at this point as well.  I would prefer Mala though because of my previously stated belief that all of the lurkers being scum could easily explain why town has had so many mislynches.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, there's Mario.  He's been pretty null for me so far.  His tunnel on Golden from very early in the game is interesting though, I would like to hear more from that slot though now that we have (hopefully) a real player there, and see how Mario reacts to it.", "time": "Fri Jan 08, 2016 7:09 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64492&start=2200", "forum": "53", "thread": "64492"}

TownFA might have been trying a gambit of some kind, trying to create a point of leverage that she could use when exploring other players.  ScumFA would have been taking an awful risk to soft claim something without a really good backup plan.  The way that things played out with RC's claim, TownFA never got to utilize the leverage that she was trying to create (because the RC claim thing pretty much forced FA to give up on that soft claim).  ScumFA could have played that fake claim very differently though.  It didn't have to turn into a head-to-head against RC like it did - it was claiming to have a result on RC that did it.  What was ScumFA's motivation for claiming a result on RC?  And at a time when RC was pressing against FA very hard to reveal the claim?  That's like the dumbest possible way to try to play that fake claim out if you're scum.  It's not a smart way to do it as town either.

Here are the three about whom I am most confident.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Frozen</div> is probably Town.

I think that Mala caught it as well (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7466026#p7466026\">498</a>). Basically, his posting was very controlled as Mafia, but here his posting is rambling, with running sentences and grammatical mistakes not typical of his performance there. I browsed a Town game (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7362542\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>) and his style was more similar there. His eventual replacement means that this might be related to his available time, but I think that the posts that he did write came close enough together (chronologically) that it didn't seem like he needed to rush them. As the game progresses, Frozen fights with RP. I see true frustration in her posts (although not as much as in RP's).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">BJI</div> seemed Town to me as well.

Keyser, Titus and Cowbells are already flipped, I have a moderate townread on Dwlee, and I'm town in the Roleplay slot. That raises the question of \"where are the scum?\". Ignoring bji, there are six players left.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Acryon</div> was stuck on Frozen Angel and the FA/RP associative case. A plausible place for scum to sit while a PR mislynch goes down.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Frozen Angel</div> was not against the Supercool lynch, but preferred Acryon. I think I townread this slot, though.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">MarioManiac</div> was not posting for the entire time the Supercool wagon built up steam. Again, plausible.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Golden</div> was also not posting, and not even voting anybody. Also plausible.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Malakittens</div> and <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TheCow</div> naked voted for Supercool about halfway through the day. TheCow didn't post for the entire time, Mala egged the Super wagon on a little. Neither ever explained their vote.<br>\n<br>\nI really would like to believe that at least one of Mala/TheCow is scum for that. Since a high proportion of the other plausible scum was totally AFK the argument of \"most big wagons have a scum on them\" is less strong that usual, since it's possible they simply didn't have the opportunity. <br>\n<br>\nHowever, I have a pretty good supporting argument: I cannot construct a believable scumteam out of the above six players that includes neither of Malakittens and TheCow. Given Mario's push on Golden day 1 I don't think they are scum together. Frozen is almost certainly not scum with Acryon (if she were I imagine Acryon would have gone for Roleplay rather than FA with the associative case) and seems unlikely to be scum with Mario based on <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7524636#p7524636\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a> - I don't think that Mario would make a post with that tone or that message about a FA-scumbuddy.<br>\n<br>\n(The catch with that argument is the possibility of Dwlee being scum... but I think I'm prepared to disregard it for now. If Mala is town I put some weight on her townread of Dwlee; I think his style is more easily read by her methods than mine. If Mala is scum then this lynch is obviously fine even if the argument doesn't quite hold water.)<br>\n<br>\n(If Dierfire's suspicions of Dwlee look like they're going somewhere interesting I may have to reassess this argument to some degree.)<br>\n<br>\nIt's not impossible Mala and TheCow are both scum but two naked unexplained votes on somebody for half a day is super sketchy and there was no guarantee they would not be called on it.<br>\n<br>\n---//---<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">About TheCow's day 2 quickhammer</div></div><br>\n<br>\nTheCow lulzhammered RadiantCowbells which was pretty stupid no matter his alignment... but if I had to pick one player on the site to lulzhammer it would certainly be RadiantCowbells so I have a little sympathy for it. Particularly in the context of RC's less-than-ideal hammer day 1.<br>\n<br>\nI also have doubts about it as a scum play by TheCow, since I don't see a reward that justifies the risk.<br>\n<br>\nIf TheCow had not hammered RadiantCowbells, there was a significant possibility somebody else would, either before or after a \"claim\" by RC, and scum would get their cop lynch. (This assumes the scum guessed RadiantCowbells was a PR, as opposed to RC just making stuff up. If scum did not think RC had a power role I find it very hard to believe they would want RC lynched this bad, as opposed to allowing him to mess up the thread further.) At worst, if it turns out RadiantCowbells has a relevant power role and town doesn't lynch him, the doctor is dead so scum can just shoot RC.<br>\n<br>\nCompare that to the situation after TheCow's hammer. Sure, scum got to lynch RadiantCowbells <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">and</div> shoot Titus, instead of (maybe) some other lynch and then shoot Cowbells. On the other hand, TheCow has turned his slot from one hiding quite effectively among the many lurkers to one under a great deal of scrutiny. I think that the natural scum play in a game where town is burning itself down is to not draw attention to one's self and just let town do their thing. TheCow seizing the dubious advantage of a Cowbells lynch at the cost of drawing lots of attention to his own slot seems unlikely. (N.B. Getting to make a shot on Titus wasn't a hugely valuable advantage from TheCow's perspective either IMO.)<br>\n<br>\nA reason this could be a reasonable scum play is if TheCow believed a scum was likely to be lynched if RadiantCowbells was not. However, the end-of-day votes besides Cowbells were on Frozen Angel, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#006600\">Titus</div> and Roleplay, all of whom I know or believe are town. I wasn't in the game at the time and don't have a super-good feel for town sentiment, so if anyone believes the lynch was likely to go somewhere else (or in particular that TheCow would believe that) do correct me here. In short, I don't think this explains the hammer.<br>\n<br>\nMalakittens was AFK the entire time that lynch went down, which I believe is null. I place no value in Roleplay's assertion that Mala's lurking after choosing to replace is scummy, on the grounds that I once saw somebody sign up for a game, roll town, then almost immediately go near-totally AFK for two weeks due to their wife having a baby. Many people don't plan very well when they sign up for games.<br>\n<br>\n---//---<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Comparing day 3 play</div></div><br>\n<br>\nFinally, and most importantly, whereas Marcrell (in TheCow's slot) is demonstrating at least a little interest in the game...

I am scum reading him but it tends to be associative with other players: I already expressed my thoughts about his interaction with Mala (in that same post), and I see some really interesting stuff regarding you and Dwlee in your initial posts that makes sense given how golden treated Dwlee.  I am not sure that I'm willing to bet the farm on a Dwlee lynch right now though, which is what I think I'd be doing if I lynched him.<br>\n<br>\nMM4 hasn't been super active either in terms of trying to make any significant cases.  In fact if someone can point me to any post in which it's evident that MM4 has done significant analysis of the game, I'd appreciate that.  I am not sure how alignment indicative this is though as it could be play style or just a general level of committment thing.  In reviewing his voting history, I get some bad vibes.  He tunneled golden for the entirety of Day 1 and going into Day 2, and only left his tunnel on golden to pick a winner in the FA vs RC claim debacle.  Now he's tunneling TheCow, his reasoning is mostly being convinced by my points about TheCow's voting history (which of course was good reasoning, so I can't blame him for that) but even more so, he doesn't like TheCow's lurking style.  Well TheCow has been reincarnated as Marcrell and is not lurking any more but ... MM4's vote remains.  Then again, so does mine, so ...<br>\n<br>\nYeah, I gotta think more about how comfortable I feel lynching Marcrell today given the above.

I don't think a great deal less of Bji for it, most everyone gets a dodgy associative case into their head every so often. Acryon jumping on it as hard as he did, on the other hand, was bizarre.

Before we say anything else I think it's important to talk about the logistics of how we handle voting today.  I propose that we have NO VOTES until we have four confirms on a lynch target, because obviously all it takes is one town player voting for a town player and then the remaining scum (assuming there are 3, which I think is the most prudent assumption) can pile on for the win.<br>\n<br>\nTherefore we should have virtual votes, where we declare what wagon we are on not using vote tags.  Furthermore, I think that it's likely to get confusing for us to have to do vote counting manually by looking back through lots of posts.<br>\n<br>\nSo I propose that when a person wants to cast a virtual vote, they list the current state of all votes.  In order to add or change your vote, you just search back to the most recent \"unofficial vote count\", modify your vote within it, increase the vote count counter (it's starting at 4.0 here, the first increment will be to 4.1), and then re-post.  So I'll start.<br>\n<br>\nOne final note: when someone is at L-1 and the final \"virtual vote\" is to be cast, i.e., the virtual hammer is to be done, it is not cast as a virtual vote.  Instead that player should cast a real vote and everyone else that was on that same wagon is obliged to complete the lynch by also casting a real vote after that.  There should be no unvoting of real votes once you've placed them.

For Acryon to be scum and fake hammer Mala and then leave her wagon because of her response requires that he believed that there was more to be gained by leaving her wagon than staying on it.  We know that Mala was town so scum should be happy with that lynch, and whatever he gained by leaving would have to be more valuable than lynching a town.<br>\n<br>\nThe only thing I can see him gaining is town credibility, but he would only gain that if Mala ended up getting lynched anyway.  So for scum-Acryon to value leaving the wagon implies that he must have believed that she was going to be lynched even without him.<br>\n<br>\nTherefore if Acryon is scum, he must have thought that the chances of Mala being lynched without him were high.  This implies to me that if Acryon is scum, then either people who were already on the wagon and stayed on the wagon are on his team, or people who subsequently joined to complete the lynch are on his team.<br>\n<br>\nThe people who were already on and stayed on were Dierfire and Mario.  The people who joined after he left (besides me) are Marcrell and Aquanim (who we know was town so isn't worth considering further).<br>\n<br>\nThis then implies that if Acryon is scum, then one or more of Dierfire, Mario, and/or Marcrell is a partner.<br>\n<br>\nThis actually strengthens both Frozen Angel's scum team of { Acryon, Mario, Marcrell }, and also one of Aquanim's scum teams of { Acryon, Mario, Marcrell } (his other team was { Acryon, Dierfire, Marcrell }, which is also supported by my argument here).  Mala herself mostly only left us with her town reads, but she did vote Acryon as one of her only scum reads at the very end, for what that's worth.<br>\n<br>\nNone of this is evidence that Acryon is scum; but it is evidence that there is some consensus between Aquanim's town analysis, Frozen Angel's possibly-town analysis, and the actual Mala wagon.<br>\n<br>\nThis doesn't help us so much today, but I think that if we lynch one of Acryon, Mario, Marcrell, or Dierfire and they flip scum, then we should be looking hard at the others, especially Acryon, for the next lynch.<br>\n<br>\nAnd even given all of that, I do think that Acryon is less likely to be scum than town because of that fake hammer, I just feel like greater certainty of a Mala lynch would be worth more than some marginal town credibility that a scum Acryon would get by leaving the Mala wagon.", "time": "Thu Jan 14, 2016 8:36 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64492&start=2475", "forum": "53", "thread": "64492"}

There is something to be said for the notion that if there is evidence to be found, we already have it.<br>\n<br>\nConsider also that we now have (almost certainly) 3 scum out of 7 players.  That means that almost half of the remaining players are going to just be trying to work to fool the remaining players into making a bad choice.  I am not entirely sure that those of us town players who are left are going to be well served by continuing to discuss when such a large percentage of players are going to try to contribute discussion that leads to a mislynch instead of a scum lynch.<br>\n<br>\nWe could stop talking now and just have some kind of run-off election to choose the lynch.

If it isn't, then we'll likely lose anyway, regardless of how much more discussion we have.<br>\n<br>\nSo given the above I was thinking about some ways that we could make a lynch choice with minimum chance of scum collusion.<br>\n<br>\nDoes this idea make any sense:<br>\n<br>\n- Each player simply posts his or her list of choices for today's lynch, as an ordered list (not including themselves of course), numbers 1 - 6, with 1 being most desired to lynch, and 6 being least<br>\n- We take a weighted average of the player's positions on everyone's list and then drop the bottom (i.e. least-desired-for-a-lynch) player or maybe 2 players<br>\n- Then we repeat, only considering the remaining players<br>\n<br>\nAfter we repeat this a few times, we will end up with a vote between the remaining two players, and the results of that vote will be the lynch choice for the day.<br>\n<br>\nIn order to prevent scum collusion, we could have one player start by posting their list, and then the topmost player from their list (i.e. most desired to be lynched) who has not yet given their list, will be the next person to give their list.  In this way, the order that the lists are given will be harder to \"game\" in a way that could be beneficial to scum by, e.g., setting early precedent.  Once this ordering is set after the first iteration, we'll re-use it for subsequent iterations.<br>\n<br>\nThis may sound convoluted, but I am just trying to think of ways to allow the best judgement of the remaining town players to overshadow the most nefarious intentions of the remaining scum players.", "time": "Thu Jan 14, 2016 9:01 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64492&start=2475", "forum": "53", "thread": "64492"}

If they're both Town then the Mafia team is Marcrell/Dwlee/MM4, which also seems weird given that Dwlee and MM4 wanted to lynch Marcrell. So one of them is probably Mafia, but I'm having a hard time deciding which one.<br>\n<br>\nFrozen apparently didn't know that bji was cleared by Radiant. That's weird. I want to say that Mafia players should be aware of this, but they didn't kill bji so maybe not? I was pretty happy reading Frozen as Town previously.<br>\n<br>\nThen we have Acryon. MM4 thought that it had \"a lot of\" utility for the Mafia, but I don't agree. A Voyeur gets results like \"protective\" or \"investigative\" which makes it practically useless for the Mafia to use on a Town player (it doesn't really inform their knowledge of the design, and it doesn't point to which player has the role). It's a weird role to fake, too; it doesn't see a lot of play (so, for example, I don't think that he'd make that claim as Mafia Goon). I guess that a Mafia Voyeur has some utility to watch a partner and find out whether there was an investigation?

I don't think this is the case (I think it's about 1000x more likely that Acryon is scum by himself than both FA and Acryon are scum), but it's certainly possible.  In my very first mafia game, my partner and I bussed hard from pretty early in the game just like FA and Acryon did.  And we won.  The comments after game were along the lines of \"I never expected scum to bus each other so hard for so long\".  I think there's other more likely scum than either of these slots for sure, but scum could both be here.  In which case, we're going to lose if we save them for last.  Just saying.<br>\n<br>\nThat being said, you've got some pretty airtight logic there on the reasons why we should save FA and Acryon until the end, unless we think they're both scum.

At the time I noted that Frozen wanted to lynch MM4 but now I can't find that. The closest that I can find is <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7567843#p7567843\">2485</a>, in which she calls the team as acryon-MM4-Marcrell but she still ended up back on acryon.<br>\n<br>\nSo, it's certain that Mafia players were expressing suspicion of MM4 and getting ready for an opportunity to vote there. Were they looking for an opportunity to catch a bus or looking for an opportunity to end the game?<br>\n<br>\nSubsequently, Frozen wants to think more (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7584274#p7584274\">2650</a>) and Dwlee now thinks that MM4 is Town (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7584691#p7584691\">2666</a>). That seems like evidence against any team that includes MM4 and Dwlee or MM4 and Frozen; if they were going to derail the lynch on their partner, I'd think that they'd do so in order to push for an immediate win. However, with Marcrell, bji, and acryon willing to vote for MM4, no such immediate win looks likely. My conclusion is that these suspicions of MM4 looked more like Mafia on Town than like Mafia on Mafia.<br>\n<br>\nThat's fine, but then the fact remains that at least one of them has to be Mafia unless bji is. If I wouldn't think that MM4 would be Mafia with Frozen or with Dwlee, then I'd have to think that for him to be Mafia would require that both acryon and Marcrell were throwing him under the proverbial bus. That's plausible with a large number of Town players expressing suspicion on MM4.<br>\n<br>\nI don't know. The whole point of leaving acryon to the last day was to see how plausible his claim looked after two Mafia players flipped, but trying to read a web of interactions and go by POE doesn't really work when I'm deliberately pushing off a decision like that.<br>\n<br>\nSo, probably I should just go read through and pick the single one out of Dwlee/MM4/Marcrell that I find most suspicious.

{"number": 2669, "id": "7585392", "user": "bji", "user_id": "25099", "content": "I think your arguments are based on debateable premises and tenuous logical connections.<br>\n<br>\n1. FA was never trying to get MM4 lynched today, as far as I know.  She has said repeatedly that she wants Acryon and only Acryon today.  This disagrees with your lumping FA and Dwlee together in terms of motivation to be on and/or to leave MM4's wagon.<br>\n<br>\n2. Because of (1), I don't think you can conclude that \"because scum bussing a scum-MM4 would have no motivation to leave his wagon at this time, and because FA left his wagon, FA must not be scum bussing scum-MM4\".  FA was never really on his wagon today, and as a result can't be said to have left it.  As far as I can tell, her position with respect to MM4 is completely unchanged.<br>\n<br>\n3. Ignoring FA now who I already addressed in (2), I think your conclusion on Dwlee doesn't follow through either.  I think you are saying that \"If Dwlee were bussing a scum partner MM4, then he wouldn't leave that bus unless he thought a push for a mislynch could quickly win; and he isn't pushing for an immediate win, therefore he wasn't scum bussing MM4\".  Well, how do you know Dwlee isn't pushing for an immediate win?  He seems to have left the MM4 wagon for an Acryon wagon which one would think already had at least some legs with FA being so committed to it, and my having expressed the sentiment that I'd lynch Acryon over FA if I had to choose.  Why can't this be the \"push for an immediate lynch\" that you were looking for?<br>\n<br>\n4. Because of (2) and (3), I don't think your conclusion that \"because MM4 can't be scum with either FA and Dwlee, if he is scum it must be with two of the three of { Acryon, bji, Marcrell }\" is valid.  The premise that MM4 can't be scum with either FA or Dwlee hasn't been shown, as I already pointed out, so you can't draw this conclusion.<br>\n<br>\nWhat I believe you are saying in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7585036#p7585036\">2667</a> is \"If two of { bji, Frozen, Acryon, and Marcrell } is mafia, then Marcrell must be one of those two, because { bji, Frozen }, { bji, Acryon }, and { Frozen, Acryon } cannot be possible scum pairs\".  I expect your reasoning for thinking that these latter three pairings is not possible is because if I am town, then that leaves { Frozen, Acryon }, which presumably you also don't think is possible?<br>\n<br>\nThat's fine logic, I guess, but it presumes that Dwlee and MM4 cannot be scum together, and I don't have any idea why that must be true.  Care to explain?<br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, I don't understand why you're basing your reads almost exclusively on associations today.  Why not vote for the single player most likely to be scum according to what you've read up to this point?  Giving preference to events of the prior days (since we know how motivated scum are to deceive today and also how numerous they are, making everything that happens today just that much less trustworthy), and especially with regards to events associated with known flips?

At the time I noted that Frozen wanted to lynch MM4 but now I can't find that. The closest that I can find is <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7567843#p7567843\">2485</a>, in which she calls the team as acryon-MM4-Marcrell but she still ended up back on acryon.<br>\n<br>\nSo, it's certain that Mafia players were expressing suspicion of MM4 and getting ready for an opportunity to vote there. Were they looking for an opportunity to catch a bus or looking for an opportunity to end the game?<br>\n<br>\nSubsequently, Frozen wants to think more (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7584274#p7584274\">2650</a>) and Dwlee now thinks that MM4 is Town (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7584691#p7584691\">2666</a>). That seems like evidence against any team that includes MM4 and Dwlee or MM4 and Frozen; if they were going to derail the lynch on their partner, I'd think that they'd do so in order to push for an immediate win. However, with Marcrell, bji, and acryon willing to vote for MM4, no such immediate win looks likely. My conclusion is that these suspicions of MM4 looked more like Mafia on Town than like Mafia on Mafia.<br>\n<br>\nThat's fine, but then the fact remains that at least one of them has to be Mafia unless bji is. If I wouldn't think that MM4 would be Mafia with Frozen or with Dwlee, then I'd have to think that for him to be Mafia would require that both acryon and Marcrell were throwing him under the proverbial bus. That's plausible with a large number of Town players expressing suspicion on MM4.<br>\n<br>\nI don't know. The whole point of leaving acryon to the last day was to see how plausible his claim looked after two Mafia players flipped, but trying to read a web of interactions and go by POE doesn't really work when I'm deliberately pushing off a decision like that.<br>\n<br>\nSo, probably I should just go read through and pick the single one out of Dwlee/MM4/Marcrell that I find most suspicious.
