I was joking about that because, Of course she is. The whole post was not a joke, only that bit, asking if Verity was out of RVS. <br>I never treated my vote as superior, but you suggested it. <br>It was a serious vote. It still is (it hasn't been removed). <br>Applefarmer's vote on you was for a fairly silly (if true) reason-- you were fishing for votes. Here I am. You caught one-- my vote. If playing the way I do gets me lynched so often, I assume it's rather indicative of scum. <br><br>Meta helps. You can't discount it entirely. I'm not basing my whole game off of everypony's meta, but I will read to see if you're doing anything out of the ordinary or anything that looks really weird. Townies have been saved on meta. Comply. I'm not asking for a scum game so I can see how you play as scum, I'm just looking for any completed game-- one where you played well. <br><br>Now: themarshall: I believe it was when I was looking for meta on Maruchan, I read some of the game you two shared. I see he has since been killed (lynched?). How unfortunate! But unrelated. <br><br>Lastly: Grimmjow, Only I'm pushing him seriously. <br>And no, it's NOT a vast over-exaggeration. I've not once had a scum-PM on this site (in a non-marathon game). I've never, here, been called \"caught scum\" and NOT been town-aligned. I suspect I never will. <br>It is a slight exaggeration though, because once, on another forum, I WAS called caught scum. Just once, off site. And they guessed right, and I was scum. But not for any reason that they could pin me down with. <br><br>Why does anypony care a shit about timezones? I've never answered that question and if I keep my resolve I never will. Who gives a shit, the deadlines are several-days long, often weeks long. My timezone has little to do with my sleep schedule and nothing to do with when I will post. It's not game-related, not in any way related to the game. So why ask it? I may as well ask you your favorite colour, or if-- <br><br>Yeah, there we go. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">What is your favorite flavour of Ice-Cream? </span> <br>Please answer, the game depends on it."}

As early as we are, I'm not worried about actually lynching you. As little as there is to go on, I'm not convinced that you're obviously scum. You and I are the only players with more than a few posts in this game.

I don't play that way when I'm scum-- in fact, I win as scum. If you'd never get voted at all, why do you point out that there are players who are suspicious of you, but don't vote you?

Whiskers doesn't seem to be doing much of anything, IMO except thread-padding. He (I'm assuming Whiskers is a he) asks Parama for meta, and when Parama says no, he continues to press the issue. If Parama doesn't want to give meta, big effin deal. Also, when I stated that I would like to know timezones, he takes this and runs with it, giving me a big \"eff you\" and then going so far as to make a joke about it? \"What's your favorite ice cream flavor?\" Really?

If you did think he was breadcrumbing, I still don't see why you'd point it out. And making a fake miller claim would actually help town, as, from what I've seen and been told, scum wants to keep millers in the game to divert attention from them. So claiming miller would make scum less likely to NK them. So I don't see how his potential fake claim is retarded. It makes sense to me.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Whiskers wrote:</cite>Actually, This makes me wonder: What if somepony DID claim miller, then was investigated, then came up not-guilty? Since non-sane cops are non-normal, what would happen?</div></blockquote><br>Well, I can see this two ways. Either the innocent comes back on a godfather, or the innocent comes back and the cop thinks his investigation target is a PR, and if said player was about to be lynched, then the cop could go \"No, don't do that, he's likely a PR and this is why.\""}

I don't care, at all, when you post, so long as you DO post. I think the problem everypony has been having with you is that you've said some stuff that doesn't agree with the current ruleset. Like, \"if you are a Miller, you won't know it.\" That may be true, but isn't always the way the role is handled. I think you're just still adjusting to the new ruleset-- according to your join date, you're new.

Yeah, looks like a scummy lurker, but lurkers are always scummy.

However, I'm kept my vote on Whiskers because I think Whiskers is far more scummy.<br><br>However, I do like how you completely took what I said out of context and manipulated it into me somehow being scum, which I don't really see the correlation, but ok.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">FoS: Parama</span><br><br>You know, I kinda had you pegged for town, but that little attempt to manipulate my words into something (somehow) scummy is really fucked up, and something that, say, someone trying to pin blame on someone else might do--ie: something scum might do.

Then Charter makes like one substantial post about why Grimm might be scum and you just go \"oh well that makes sense\" and jump on the bandwagon. Why would you jump on a different bandwagon and then not scumhunt that person? You just kept on pushing on Parama without voting him. That makes no sense. Plus it doesn't help that you got \"duped\" into helping hammer killer. You're just as responsible as Parama for that shit hammer.<br><br>But what really concerns me is Parama. He is just taking charge, trying to lynch someone. I would like to have some solid reasoning but I doubt I will get it with how you have been talking the past few pages. Which again doesn't make sense because you were perfectly fine with sharing your evidence for your FoS and votes earlier in the game, why not now? I know this might be a stretch, but maybe you are 3rd party anti-town? This is only my second forum mafia game and I'm not sure what possible setups we could be in (If someone could provide a link that would be really helpful) but DX I think said we could have 4 anti-town. So if that is the case and Parama is a part of one of the anti-town factions, all he has to do it push a ML, wait for them to claim town, then tell the other faction who to kill. That would bring the game down to 8 players tomorrow so that they force the NL and joint. I could be completely wrong on that, and if I am please correct me. It's just really jarring when Parama makes all of these \"you could choose my avy for 6 months\" bets. That is quite a bargain to make on such little information for someone who is a vet. It makes me think he knows for a fact that there is a 3rd party.<br><br>Towards the end of my catch-up I got a little lazy and started skimming again, but I will look back and try to see why you guys find Grimm scummy. It would save us all a lot of time if someone on that wagon would explain their reasoning."}

I do think that putting some pressure on him might have been good, and it might have kicked him into gear and got him to actually play the game, but even if that wasn't the case, one more town player, even if they're an idiot, is better than lynching said town player when there was still the possibility, and the time, for actual scum-hunting and lynching scum.

Parama is or could be vetscum. He's not a new player. Competent, overconfident, I have the feeling that he plays with more caution in games where he wants to lynch scum. <br>\"Scum rarely quickhammer like that\" means that him hammering is something scum would not do.

Parama is in no way the easiest target. And no, \"your boy\" Parama is unconfirmed one way or another. Unless you'd like to claim cop? <br>That's what I thought. <br>Furthermore, letting your gutscum read off the hook for voting with you is bullshit. Voting with town is not a town-read. Scum can vote with town-- in fact, if you look on killer's wagon, I bEt you there was scum on it. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>don_johnson wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>marsha wrote:</cite>But what really concerns me is Parama.

Parama said \"I push lynches on the players I accuse as town &amp; as scum.\" Trying to lynch players is NOT a towntell. His scummy play is also not a town tell (as you say it is). <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>don_johnson wrote:</cite>not sure why there is so much talk about two scum factions when there is absolutely no evidence to support the theory whatsoever. but whatevz.</div></blockquote>I don't know either, but this next bit deals with that a little bit. <br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3415831#p3415831\" class=\"postlink\">post 246</a>, David Xanatos wrote:</cite>People seem to be taking my note that it's possible for there to be 4 scum and automatically tuning themselves into an unannounced fire/ice.. which is rather silly.<br><br>I'm not sure about Grimm, need to re-read.. don't like whiskers though.

I've had some shit to deal with in real life lately.<br><br>I've had a lecturer claim a coursework piece was late which has meant I need to resit two seperate modules in second year, meaning I need to delay third year by a year, I've been trying hard to get this overturned but it simply hasn't worked, I'm shitting myself about my dad getting home from his fortnight away with the Territorial Army because he's going to kill me, I feel bad because through all this I haven't been able to get a part time job since the last place sacked me because of an error on the payroll department's part (I was booked for 3 weeks holiday, they put me down for 2, so I was classed as AWOL for the last week and rather than fix it, they sacked me.) and all in all, I've been feeling pretty shit about things. I'm telling you all this because yes, I haven't been putting as much effort in here as I should be. I intend to fix that, starting now. So, I'm asking for a little time to re-read, draw up some proper thoughts et cetera. I will give the focus required here from now."}

Even his most recent post. If everyone had all their reads on the table and everyone was ready for a hammer, then yeah, it might be a little scummy to \"ask permission\". But we just had 3 replacements and we're letting people catch up. We want all the reads from everyone out in the open so we can analyze them after the flip and after the NK. I'm bringing this up because I feel like he's misrepresenting Whisker's case. <br><br>As far as the inactivity in day 1 went, this is only my second game and I haven't even finished my first one yet. But I knew it took a while to actually get a game going and whatnot, so I wanted two games to play at the same time so if I got killed in one I still had another one to play without having to wait a week for a game to fill up and everyone confirm, yadd yadd yadda. So just as I got my PM for this game, my first game started climaxing with vote deadlocks and it got really exciting there for a while. So basically I was giving all of my attention to the first game, and I apologize for that. So since day 2 started I have tried to spend the same amount of time in both of the games. So it's no real excuse but meh, it's what happened.<br><br>Other reads include:<br><br>Whiskers - Towards the beginning of the game I really thought you might be scum. You seemed to be nitpicking a bit too much and fencesitting/jumping votes. The nitpicking I now realize was pressure and maybe you're like me and you vote instead of FoS, which is cool. But still, you seem to be jumping a little too much.<br><br>Parama- The opposite of Whiskers. You seemed most pro-town towards the beginning, and since the end of yesterday and so far today, you have become a little more scummy. It may just be your conviction in the Grimm lynch that is making you seem so pushy, but I will have to see how he flips to really get a good read. Also, the two town factions thing really seems scummy to me for some reason. Especially because you are so sure. That comment about Grimm choosing your avy sort of makes me think he's going to wait until the game is over and just go \"HAHA I EVEN SOFTCLAIMED 3RD PARTY SCUM U FIGGITS!\" but that might just be me being paranoid.<br><br>Verity - Besides being a huge asshole, pretty town I guess. Good reads and whatnot but I didn't like how it was like pulling goddamn teeth just to get a reason for his vote. I mean, you must have a reason, why not just share?<br><br>Hayker - Hasn't really said much. That thing that Beck quoted is really just what he said it is. Hypocritical. I don't really see him as scum. He helped stop town from derailing on the miller claim, and I agree with his points. Yes, even the one against me, because at the time it was valid. <br><br>The other people I'll have to reread a little later when I have more time."}

The part about d_j is clearly not relevant anymore so I took it out.  Other than that it's complete and there will be more from me later tonight or tomorrow.)<br><br>Hi!  I'm your new whipping boy from Day 3, hopefully not so much during Day 4.<br><br>First, a shout-out to Whiskers and David, both of whom I've played with and enjoyed playing with so much that I signed up to replace.  Hi ponies!<br><br>Okay, enough of that.  That's the last buddying you'll see from me to those two.  More on that in a bit.<br><br>Anyway, I was working on this large wall with read on everyone as my introduction BUT kept coming back to a couple of things which aren't clear, making it hard for me to finalize it.  Plus the last time I wrote up a full night-read on a game, I wound up dead that night so it was all a waste of time I don't want to go through again.<br><br>So I'm going to claim because it's my turn, <strike>then d_j will claim, and then I want to see one player in particular's reaction to d_j's claim (I'm not saying who quite yet though).</strike> Then I'll post fresh reads including those results and whatever happened tonight.<br><br>I'm a plain old Vanilla Townie.<br><br><strike>d_j, go.</strike><br><br>---<br><br>A little bit more now, though.  There are a couple of things which weren't making sense to me while I was reading through this.<br><br>1) I saw several people saying David Xanatos is confirmed town, that he stopped a kill by jailkeeping Whiskers.  Nearest I can tell we have no proof of this whatsoever.  He could be scum, no-killing last night, and using the admittedly extremely risky jailkeeper claim to try to paint Whiskers however he'd like.<br><br>He also hasn't said who he jailkept night 1.  Who was it, David?  And how about last night?<br><br>2) I also see people saying that due to David's claim, Whiskers is either confirmed town or confirmed scum.  I have no idea how they get either of those results.  <span style=\"font-style: italic\">If</span> David's telling the truth, then Whiskers could be either the target of scum or the scum hitpony.  It's not a tell on Whiskers either way.<br><br>And, Whiskers and David could be scumbuddies, playing the whole story for town cred.<br><br>---<br><br>Finally, for ease of reference in the future, here are the current claims in the order they were submitted, for the players still alive.<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: claims in order</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Parama - Miller<br>David Xanatos - Jailkeeper<br>Whiskers - Body Guard (although thought he was VT)<br>killerjester - VT<br>themarshall - VT<br>Beck - ROCKSTAR townie<br>Zdenek - VT<br><strike>don_johnson - ?, watcher on parama N1 and Whiskers N2</strike><br>me VT</div></div></div>"}

I understood his role to be \"Use this once per night, on one target, as long as you're alive.  If you're successful, you die.\"  Those are limitations.  \"No limitations\" means, to me, \"Use it as often as you want each night on as many people as you want, but if one of them is killed then you die instead.\"  So while I'd be curious what limitations you think might be on it, I think this is just an irrelevant semantics discussion.<br><br>That setup you link to is enlightening, though.  One thing I noticed about that is the presence of a serial killer.  It seems unlikely that role is in this game, because we've had 3 nights and only 2 kills.  So what role do you think is filling that other slot, a 7th VT?  If anything, it seems to strengthen David's claim, and put more suspicion on Whiskers as possible scum who David blocked.  Whisker's claimed role is one which cannot be proven except by its successful use or a flip.  Seems pretty safe for scum to hide behind.  I know there was suspicion on Whiskers earlier so it's probably time for me to review the cases against him and come up with my own take.  Although it'd have to be a pretty strong argument against to get me to lynch the only claimed role which can protect our Jailkeeper."}

I'm your new whipping boy from Day 3, hopefully not so much during Day 4.<br><br>First, a shout-out to Whiskers and David, both of whom I've played with and enjoyed playing with so much that I signed up to replace.  Hi ponies!<br><br>Okay, enough of that.  That's the last buddying you'll see from me to those two.  More on that in a bit.<br><br>Anyway, I was working on this large wall with read on everyone as my introduction BUT kept coming back to a couple of things which aren't clear, making it hard for me to finalize it.  Plus the last time I wrote up a full night-read on a game, I wound up dead that night so it was all a waste of time I don't want to go through again.<br><br>So I'm going to claim because it's my turn, then d_j will claim, and then I want to see one player in particular's reaction to d_j's claim (I'm not saying who quite yet though).  Then I'll post fresh reads including those results and whatever happened tonight.<br><br>I'm a plain old Vanilla Townie.<br><br>d_j, go.<br><br>---<br><br>A little bit more now, though.  There are a couple of things which weren't making sense to me while I was reading through this.<br><br>1) I saw several people saying David Xanatos is confirmed town, that he stopped a kill by jailkeeping Whiskers.  Nearest I can tell we have no proof of this whatsoever.  He could be scum, no-killing last night, and using the admittedly extremely risky jailkeeper claim to try to paint Whiskers however he'd like.<br><br>He also hasn't said who he jailkept night 1.  Who was it, David?  And how about last night?<br><br>2) I also see people saying that due to David's claim, Whiskers is either confirmed town or confirmed scum.  I have no idea how they get either of those results.  <span style=\"font-style: italic\">If</span> David's telling the truth, then Whiskers could be either the target of scum or the scum hitpony.  It's not a tell on Whiskers either way.<br><br>And, Whiskers and David could be scumbuddies, playing the whole story for town cred.<br><br>---<br><br>Finally, for ease of reference in the future, here are the current claims in the order they were submitted, for the players still alive.<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: claims in order</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Parama - Miller<br>David Xanatos - Jailkeeper<br>Whiskers - Body Guard (although thought he was VT)<br>killerjester - VT<br>themarshall - VT<br>Beck - ROCKSTAR townie<br>Zdenek - VT<br>don_johnson - ?, watcher on parama N1 and Whiskers N2<br>me VT</div></div></div>"}
