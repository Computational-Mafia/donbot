I was joking about that because, Of course she is. The whole post was not a joke, only that bit, asking if Verity was out of RVS. <br>\nI never treated my vote as superior, but you suggested it. <br>\nIt was a serious vote. It still is (it hasn't been removed). <br>\nApplefarmer's vote on you was for a fairly silly (if true) reason-- you were fishing for votes. Here I am. You caught one-- my vote. If playing the way I do gets me lynched so often, I assume it's rather indicative of scum. <br>\n<br>\nMeta helps. You can't discount it entirely. I'm not basing my whole game off of everypony's meta, but I will read to see if you're doing anything out of the ordinary or anything that looks really weird. Townies have been saved on meta. Comply. I'm not asking for a scum game so I can see how you play as scum, I'm just looking for any completed game-- one where you played well. <br>\n<br>\nNow: themarshall: I believe it was when I was looking for meta on Maruchan, I read some of the game you two shared. I see he has since been killed (lynched?). How unfortunate! But unrelated. <br>\n<br>\nLastly: Grimmjow, Only I'm pushing him seriously. <br>\nAnd no, it's NOT a vast over-exaggeration. I've not once had a scum-PM on this site (in a non-marathon game). I've never, here, been called \"caught scum\" and NOT been town-aligned. I suspect I never will. <br>\nIt is a slight exaggeration though, because once, on another forum, I WAS called caught scum. Just once, off site. And they guessed right, and I was scum. But not for any reason that they could pin me down with. <br>\n<br>\nWhy does anypony care a shit about timezones? I've never answered that question and if I keep my resolve I never will. Who gives a shit, the deadlines are several-days long, often weeks long. My timezone has little to do with my sleep schedule and nothing to do with when I will post. It's not game-related, not in any way related to the game. So why ask it?

It's pretty much the same as the point I make below.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThe \"alarm\" I was raising was not to the fact that someone had 3 votes on them, it was the fact that these three votes came VERY quickly into D1. With 7 to lynch, the wagon was almost half way created by page 2. This seems very quick, and I'm always very cautious when it comes to people voting someone really quickly, because it seems as though people aren't really putting thought into it, or that scum's jumping on the wagon early to avoid suspicion. This being my first game outside of the newbie thread, I'm just stating that I find it weird that as of page friggin 2 someone already has 3 votes on them. I typically am very cautious when placing a vote, because I want to be sure of my vote.<br>\n<br>\nI am a little wary of Whiskers' push off to Apple when dealing with Parama. Whiskers doesn't seem to be doing much of anything, IMO except thread-padding. He (I'm assuming Whiskers is a he) asks Parama for meta, and when Parama says no, he continues to press the issue. If Parama doesn't want to give meta, big effin deal. Also, when I stated that I would like to know timezones, he takes this and runs with it, giving me a big \"eff you\" and then going so far as to make a joke about it? \"What's your favorite ice cream flavor?\" Really? Asking for time zones gives me an idea of when someone will be posting, so I can sit back and not expect a response for, say, 18 hours as opposed to 6.

If you did think he was breadcrumbing, I still don't see why you'd point it out. And making a fake miller claim would actually help town, as, from what I've seen and been told, scum wants to keep millers in the game to divert attention from them.

Then Charter makes like one substantial post about why Grimm might be scum and you just go \"oh well that makes sense\" and jump on the bandwagon. Why would you jump on a different bandwagon and then not scumhunt that person? You just kept on pushing on Parama without voting him. That makes no sense. Plus it doesn't help that you got \"duped\" into helping hammer killer. You're just as responsible as Parama for that shit hammer.<br>\n<br>\nBut what really concerns me is Parama. He is just taking charge, trying to lynch someone. I would like to have some solid reasoning but I doubt I will get it with how you have been talking the past few pages. Which again doesn't make sense because you were perfectly fine with sharing your evidence for your FoS and votes earlier in the game, why not now? I know this might be a stretch, but maybe you are 3rd party anti-town? This is only my second forum mafia game and I'm not sure what possible setups we could be in (If someone could provide a link that would be really helpful) but DX I think said we could have 4 anti-town. So if that is the case and Parama is a part of one of the anti-town factions, all he has to do it push a ML, wait for them to claim town, then tell the other faction who to kill. That would bring the game down to 8 players tomorrow so that they force the NL and joint. I could be completely wrong on that, and if I am please correct me. It's just really jarring when Parama makes all of these \"you could choose my avy for 6 months\" bets. That is quite a bargain to make on such little information for someone who is a vet. It makes me think he knows for a fact that there is a 3rd party.<br>\n<br>\nTowards the end of my catch-up I got a little lazy and started skimming again, but I will look back and try to see why you guys find Grimm scummy.

Even his most recent post. If everyone had all their reads on the table and everyone was ready for a hammer, then yeah, it might be a little scummy to \"ask permission\". But we just had 3 replacements and we're letting people catch up. We want all the reads from everyone out in the open so we can analyze them after the flip and after the NK.

So just as I got my PM for this game, my first game started climaxing with vote deadlocks and it got really exciting there for a while. So basically I was giving all of my attention to the first game, and I apologize for that. So since day 2 started I have tried to spend the same amount of time in both of the games.

You seemed most pro-town towards the beginning, and since the end of yesterday and so far today, you have become a little more scummy. It may just be your conviction in the Grimm lynch that is making you seem so pushy, but I will have to see how he flips to really get a good read. Also, the two town factions thing really seems scummy to me for some reason. Especially because you are so sure.

{"number": 721, "id": "3468128", "user": "saulres", "user_id": "16558", "content": "(Disclaimer: This post was written in preparation, two days ago, as a copy-paste introduction.  The part about d_j is clearly not relevant anymore so I took it out.  Other than that it's complete and there will be more from me later tonight or tomorrow.)<br>\n<br>\nHi!  I'm your new whipping boy from Day 3, hopefully not so much during Day 4.<br>\n<br>\nFirst, a shout-out to Whiskers and David, both of whom I've played with and enjoyed playing with so much that I signed up to replace.  Hi ponies!<br>\n<br>\nOkay, enough of that.  That's the last buddying you'll see from me to those two.  More on that in a bit.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, I was working on this large wall with read on everyone as my introduction BUT kept coming back to a couple of things which aren't clear, making it hard for me to finalize it.  Plus the last time I wrote up a full night-read on a game, I wound up dead that night so it was all a waste of time I don't want to go through again.<br>\n<br>\nSo I'm going to claim because it's my turn, <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">then d_j will claim, and then I want to see one player in particular's reaction to d_j's claim (I'm not saying who quite yet though).</div> Then I'll post fresh reads including those results and whatever happened tonight.<br>\n<br>\nI'm a plain old Vanilla Townie.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">d_j, go.</div><br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nA little bit more now, though.  There are a couple of things which weren't making sense to me while I was reading through this.<br>\n<br>\n1) I saw several people saying David Xanatos is confirmed town, that he stopped a kill by jailkeeping Whiskers.  Nearest I can tell we have no proof of this whatsoever.  He could be scum, no-killing last night, and using the admittedly extremely risky jailkeeper claim to try to paint Whiskers however he'd like.<br>\n<br>\nHe also hasn't said who he jailkept night 1.  Who was it, David?  And how about last night?<br>\n<br>\n2) I also see people saying that due to David's claim, Whiskers is either confirmed town or confirmed scum.  I have no idea how they get either of those results.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">If</div> David's telling the truth, then Whiskers could be either the target of scum or the scum hitpony.  It's not a tell on Whiskers either way.<br>\n<br>\nAnd, Whiskers and David could be scumbuddies, playing the whole story for town cred.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nFinally, for ease of reference in the future, here are the current claims in the order they were submitted, for the players still alive.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: claims in order</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">Parama - Miller<br>\nDavid Xanatos - Jailkeeper<br>\nWhiskers - Body Guard (although thought he was VT)<br>\nkillerjester - VT<br>\nthemarshall - VT<br>\nBeck - ROCKSTAR townie<br>\nZdenek - VT<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">don_johnson - ?, watcher on parama N1 and Whiskers N2</div><br>\nme VT</div></div></div>", "time": "Sun Sep 25, 2011 1:56 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18910&start=700", "forum": "53", "thread": "18910"}

If you're successful, you die.\"  Those are limitations.  \"No limitations\" means, to me, \"Use it as often as you want each night on as many people as you want, but if one of them is killed then you die instead.\"  So while I'd be curious what limitations you think might be on it, I think this is just an irrelevant semantics discussion.<br>\n<br>\nThat setup you link to is enlightening, though.  One thing I noticed about that is the presence of a serial killer.  It seems unlikely that role is in this game, because we've had 3 nights and only 2 kills.  So what role do you think is filling that other slot, a 7th VT?  If anything, it seems to strengthen David's claim, and put more suspicion on Whiskers as possible scum who David blocked.  Whisker's claimed role is one which cannot be proven except by its successful use or a flip.  Seems pretty safe for scum to hide behind.  I know there was suspicion on Whiskers earlier so it's probably time for me to review the cases against him and come up with my own take.  Although it'd have to be a pretty strong argument against to get me to lynch the only claimed role which can protect our Jailkeeper.", "time": "Mon Sep 26, 2011 7:23 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18910&start=750", "forum": "53", "thread": "18910"}

I'm your new whipping boy from Day 3, hopefully not so much during Day 4.<br>\n<br>\nFirst, a shout-out to Whiskers and David, both of whom I've played with and enjoyed playing with so much that I signed up to replace.  Hi ponies!<br>\n<br>\nOkay, enough of that.  That's the last buddying you'll see from me to those two.  More on that in a bit.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, I was working on this large wall with read on everyone as my introduction BUT kept coming back to a couple of things which aren't clear, making it hard for me to finalize it.  Plus the last time I wrote up a full night-read on a game, I wound up dead that night so it was all a waste of time I don't want to go through again.<br>\n<br>\nSo I'm going to claim because it's my turn, then d_j will claim, and then I want to see one player in particular's reaction to d_j's claim (I'm not saying who quite yet though).  Then I'll post fresh reads including those results and whatever happened tonight.<br>\n<br>\nI'm a plain old Vanilla Townie.<br>\n<br>\nd_j, go.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nA little bit more now, though.  There are a couple of things which weren't making sense to me while I was reading through this.<br>\n<br>\n1) I saw several people saying David Xanatos is confirmed town, that he stopped a kill by jailkeeping Whiskers.  Nearest I can tell we have no proof of this whatsoever.  He could be scum, no-killing last night, and using the admittedly extremely risky jailkeeper claim to try to paint Whiskers however he'd like.<br>\n<br>\nHe also hasn't said who he jailkept night 1.  Who was it, David?  And how about last night?<br>\n<br>\n2) I also see people saying that due to David's claim, Whiskers is either confirmed town or confirmed scum.  I have no idea how they get either of those results.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">If</div> David's telling the truth, then Whiskers could be either the target of scum or the scum hitpony.  It's not a tell on Whiskers either way.<br>\n<br>\nAnd, Whiskers and David could be scumbuddies, playing the whole story for town cred.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nFinally, for ease of reference in the future, here are the current claims in the order they were submitted, for the players still alive.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: claims in order</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">Parama - Miller<br>\nDavid Xanatos - Jailkeeper<br>\nWhiskers - Body Guard (although thought he was VT)<br>\nkillerjester - VT<br>\nthemarshall - VT<br>\nBeck - ROCKSTAR townie<br>\nZdenek - VT<br>\ndon_johnson - ?, watcher on parama N1 and Whiskers N2<br>\nme VT</div></div></div>", "time": "Tue Oct 04, 2011 5:36 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18910&start=875", "forum": "53", "thread": "18910"}
