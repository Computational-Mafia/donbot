With the wave of a hand, 12 chairs in a circle materialize in the middle of the room. The black figure instantly changes into an elderly man, the visage of a wizened teacher, complete with liver spots, wrinkles, and scholarly harry potter-esq spectactles. <br>\n<br>\nWithout any delay, students start blinking into the chairs without any order. Within the span of several seconds, all the chairs are filled with students from all over the globe, represented by all races and genders. A motley crew of youngsters, some of them start laughing and playing amongst themselves, while others just sit perfectly still, completely uninterested in the prospect of social interaction. <br>\n<br>\n\"Class, today I have something very special for you.\" - the avatar of the old teacher said. Whether their teacher actually looked like that or if it was just an idol designed to create an impression of wisdom, they didnt know. They respected him regardless, as this particular Teacher-Intelligence was over 200 years old.<br>\n<br>\n\"Roughly a thousand years ago, in the Age of Upheaval, about 30 years before the first singularity burst - there existed a game people used to play. People dont play it anymore as we have constructs that are about a million times more sophisticated, but nonetheless today you will learn about the people of mafiascum.net\"<br>\n<br>\nSeveral of the students sighed, while others accessed any data they could on the subject instantly. One of the latter spoke up.<br>\n<br>\n\"There is very little data available about that site, TI-Tiemaetre\"<br>\n<br>\n\"Ha! That is because most data from that time is lost forever. But I have trawled enough information from various cached sources that will allow me to teach you what it was about.\"<br>\n<br>\nSuddenly, in a millisecond, each of the students were granted the knowledge and rules of the game of mafia as played on mafiascum.net a thousand years ago by way of a TI.exe program sent directly into their memory. The teacher smiled. The students started chattering amongst themselves, as personal messaging was not allowed in the presence of a TI. Even some of the more stoic students seemed interested.</div><br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#800040\">Game Play, Etiquette, Basics</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>1a.

I will only moderate politeness in the thread for extreme situations, but keep in mind it&#8217;s just a game and act accordingly. <br>\n<br>\n3a. This is a closed game. Roles may not be quoted in any form. No mod PM may be quoted in any form. Very small, invisible or encrypted text is not allowed. <br>\n<br>\n4a. No forms of cryptography. This includes using ciphers, encrypted text, etc. You aren't a spy in WWII, you're a dude playing some mafia.<br>\n<br>\n5a. No \"Trust Tells\" - Trust Tells are specific tells that absolutely verify a fact beyond the reasonable doubt associated with mafia games. Common examples of Trust Tells are Red Text of Truth and Pooky Promise. However, a couple of other Trust Tells exist specific to the person using them. All Trust Tells can be broken, but only for specific people and are almost universally always correct. The only time a Trust Tell is broken is when people sacrifice the ability to use the infinitely usually confirming themselves as town to win a single game as Mafia or a Third Party.

This game will start with a Day phase; Nights are 72 hours long, during which the thread will be locked. Any actions not submitted will be missed; any player or faction with an ability may choose not to perform it. <br>\n<br>\n10a.

Not much else to it. His attack is preconceived - he has been planning to target me the whole day, and is largely fake scumhunting (read: this is fake mafia aggression). He also isn't even trying to read anyone else [he threw around a few vague statements in #208]. This is BBmolla in \"I am defending my scumbuddy Nisani and being superobvious about it\" WIFOM mode. <br>\n<br>\nI suggest BBmolla as the vig target regardless of the lynch today. I hope we have a vig.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nOman is town who hates my playstyle. It's unfortunate but he has a terrible townread on Nisani and that is shaping his whole game. But OMAN I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Oman wrote:</cite><br>\nNisani is town, just very very new to the game of mafia. </div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nOMAN HAS IT OCCURRED TO YOU THAT MAFIA MAY HAVE DAYTALK AND NISANI HAD THAT POST CRAFTED FOR HIM BY HIS MAFIA BUDDIES? This is not a fucking stretch don't say it is [and I still don't see what you do - at all. Look at the fact that Nisani has basically disappeared off the face of the Earth while this wagon has started on me. Nisani is playing the VI card. Look at his one post before I started attacking him - his tone is completely different from that of a VI. PLEASE TELL ME YOU SEE THIS. Everything Nisani has done has been crafted - whether by him or someone else. That, and the counterwagon on me is just terrible]<br>\n<br>\nWe also seem to agree on Kondi-scum, who is doing more than shameless bandwagoning at this point.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nTajun has literally done nothing but post one wall tunneling on me and then disappeared. Tajun, please show up and comment on the rest of the game [ie. not just me]. Tajun could definitely be opportunistic scum BUT this could also be town who really really hates my playstyle and is tunneling on me early [and the sad thing is? If this IS town he's probably getting lynched for being on this wagon]<br>\n<br>\nSo which one is he? TAJUN POST MORE. You are tunneling town or obvscum. You know why I've changed my tune and am leaning the first now? Your reads. They are<br>\na) terrible to have if you are scum. You have null reads on like half the game.<br>\nb) You have Peabody and Arugula as town, BOTH OF WHOM ARE ON THE NISANI WAGON. You have Mallard and Agar as null-scum, BOTH OF WHOM WERE VOTING ME EARLIER TODAY. This might be meaningless but I want you to answer this question: based on WHO is on the wagon, which wagon looks better? Me or Nisani?<br>\n<br>\nOf course I know better than to preach to tunneling townies, so if you get lynched tomorrow and cost us the game please quit the site and go elsewhere. Your lack of effort into this game is not appreciated. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nNisani is scum. I've already outlined why and so have several others. More telling things:<br>\n<br>\n- he has disappeared. Town don't tend to completely disappear when they are under pressure. Noobscum DO. HARD. And this counterwagon, so blatant and obvious. And nearly all of the people are citing playstyle issues OR lurking hardcore OR (see below). How anyone on my wagon can think they are in good company is beyond me.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nKondi is mafia unless Nisani is mafia. If Nisani is mafia, one of BBmolla/Kondi is pretty much 100% mafia. If Nisani is not mafia, Kondi and BBmolla are BOTH mafia [but PLEASE LYNCH BBMOLLA FIRST DO NOT IGNORE THIS POINT]<br>\n<br>\nI never originally outlined why Kondi was mafia - I feared that if I was onto something I would be killed. Let me tell you the ORIGINAL reasons why Kondi is mafia:<br>\n<br>\n1) He has done absolutely nothing with his early questions. I'm talking about these:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Nisani: Link to a town and a scum game.</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Hez, what was the most recently finished game you were town in?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nHe has not used this information in any way to help him decide who is mafia. He is merely hopping bandwagons and hardcore-buddying BBmolla [this is why Nisani can be mafia without BBmolla being mafia -- we would have a Nisani/Kondi combination. HOWEVER I THINK BBMOLLA IS MORE LIKELY TO BE MAFIA THAN KONDI]<br>\n<br>\nSo, one more time for those of you who can't read:<br>\n<br>\n1) early questions attempting to look town, but has not used this information in any way to HELP HIM DECIDE THE WAGON. He's just hopping.<br>\n2) the hardcore buddying of BBmolla -- <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Kondi is in a position right now where he really doesn't want to upset the town leaders - he declared me town for the first several days, then when BBmolla stepped up his aggression on me he buddied Molla instead with the hope that it would eliminate another town leader in myself</div><br>\n<br>\nI guarantee one of BBmolla and Kondi is mafia. If Nisani is town, they are probably both mafia.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe last mafia? Off my wagon.

His parenthetical comment looked more to serve as a supporting argument for Oman's \"wishy-washiness\".  <br>\n<br>\nI'm not a fan of the AGar case on Argula.  It's just bad for the most part, based on a misinterpretation of words.  <br>\n<br>\nI'm not a fan of the BBMolla/Hez exchange.  Some of the things Hez has been saying has struck me as odd and causes me to question him.  The overconfidence isn't helping. My interpretation:<br>\n\"BBMolla: Hey Hez, you're scum.<br>\nHez: No I'm not.  You are.<br>\nBBMolla: No you are.<br>\nHez: No, trust me.  I'm infallible.  You're scum.<br>\nBBMolla: Infallible?

I'm leaning toward a Kondi-scum regardless of Nisani's alignment.  <br>\n<br>\nI don't think people have been 'crafting' Nisani's posts.  He's been consistently the same person with the same alignment peaking out of his words.  I'm pretty Nisani is scum.<br>\n<br>\nBesides, out of a Hez vs a Nisani flip, the Nisani flip is infinitely more informative.  I've noticed the town has split in two over his alignment.  <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Oversoul wrote:</cite><br>\nPeabody, the fact that you can see the motivation of town in the post proves my point that this could Nisani playing a game that is much too aggressive for his normal playstyle.</div></blockquote><br>\nI'm still not seeing how an aggressive Nisani means town.

His scumplay is much less aggressive and aims to appease rather than displease. He tries not to step on people's toes and generally is among the other townies.<br>\n<br>\nBBmolla here is different from what I have seen as scum and reminds me of the strong individual play like from Paranoia Mafia where he campaigned a speedlynch in order to catch the Mafia off guard.<br>\n<br>\nHezlucky is playing almost identical to way he played in Paranoia Mafia. I have no examples of his scumplay since I don't think he has flipped as scum in any game since he returned (Hez correct this if i am wrong). He plays the overtly aggressive townie that calls the mafia from a few votes and a few hops. Generally he is fairly accurate with his assumptions, but given his playstyle he has trouble convincing others of joining him on a wagon. <br>\n<br>\nNisani I just cannot see as mafia. His play is suspicious I will give you all of that but the comments that he is making are upfront about everything he feels. He doesn't notice the scumminess of his own words and yet he has played 12 games. The only reason I feel that would happen is if he is legitimately town and doesn't understand why he is under pressure.<br>\n<br>\nAgar is scumhunting. I like his push against Argula and I think Argula is a good person to target because their play is suspicious. I really don't know how to describe it other than \"off\". Certain aspects about Argula remind me of Nisani however which makes me hesitant to place a vote on him, at least not until there is more information.<br>\n<br>\nCommonMan is suspicious as well because his posts all look completely contrived. I don't know if he is trying to role play or what but his posts don't look natural. They all are forced and the tone given off by them is unsettling. He is one to watch.<br>\n<br>\nOman is another person to watch as I feel he is much more prevalent and he should be since he is one of the older players here. <br>\n<br>\nKondi is scum because despite a large volume of posts, none of them are really filled with any sort of substance. He originally pinged my scumdar when he addressed Oman and I still can't quite figure out why I don't like that post so much other than the fact that it is smarmy and trying to deflect onto another person (Moneybags) who he just defended and advocated as a vig shot. At first I thought it was an attempt against Moneybags, but it could also be an attempt at Oman. However, he never really pursues that train of thought like I thought he would despite his suspicions.<br>\n<br>\nHis votes have been opportunistic and go back and forth between the largest wagons at the time.<br>\n<br>\nHe places these votes during high traffic and without reasoning most likely in order to draw less attention to himself and slide onto the wagon.<br>\n<br>\nHe isn't scumhunting is probably the best description that I can come up with. He is content with doing nothing while the town does something, evidenced by his votes.<br>\n<br>\nJury is still out on Moneybags and Tajun.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Kondi</span>", "time": "Sun Jun 03, 2012 7:13 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22083&start=325", "forum": "53", "thread": "22083"}

I like his push against Argula and I think Argula is a good person to target because their play is suspicious. I really don't know how to describe it other than \"off\". Certain aspects about Argula remind me of Nisani however which makes me hesitant to place a vote on him, at least not until there is more information.<br>\n<br>\nCommonMan is suspicious as well because his posts all look completely contrived. I don't know if he is trying to role play or what but his posts don't look natural. They all are forced and the tone given off by them is unsettling. He is one to watch.<br>\n<br>\nOman is another person to watch as I feel he is much more prevalent and he should be since he is one of the older players here. <br>\n<br>\nKondi is scum because despite a large volume of posts, none of them are really filled with any sort of substance. He originally pinged my scumdar when he addressed Oman and I still can't quite figure out why I don't like that post so much other than the fact that it is smarmy and trying to deflect onto another person (Moneybags) who he just defended and advocated as a vig shot. At first I thought it was an attempt against Moneybags, but it could also be an attempt at Oman. However, he never really pursues that train of thought like I thought he would despite his suspicions.<br>\n<br>\nHis votes have been opportunistic and go back and forth between the largest wagons at the time.<br>\n<br>\nHe places these votes during high traffic and without reasoning most likely in order to draw less attention to himself and slide onto the wagon.<br>\n<br>\nHe isn't scumhunting is probably the best description that I can come up with. He is content with doing nothing while the town does something, evidenced by his votes.<br>\n<br>\nJury is still out on Moneybags and Tajun.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Kondi</span></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI am happy to lynch one of BBmolla/Kondi/Nisani today.

He's also posting up these shitty paragraph-and-a-half posts that don't say a fucking thing every so often and then ducking out because, well, no one is giving any fucks about him.<br>\n<br>\nAgain, newbtown, like I suspect Nisani to be, tend to suddenly go under when they come under acute suspicion, because they don't know what to do and everything they say comes under further scrutiny and is generally pushed against them.<br>\n<br>\nHey, it's like that exact same scenario played out this game!<br>\n<br>\nMeanwhile you've zeroed in on Nisani/Kondi and ignored preeetty much everything else this game save the occasional pot-shot when someone doesn't agree with you. You've dismissed the points against Arugula not with any kind of reasoning, but with \"Well he's not a lynch option today.\" Well, 3 people have their votes planted there last I checked, so it's about fucking time people started commenting on it with more than \"Oh, he's not a lynch option today.\" <br>\n<br>\nWe're getting a replacement for Kondi, so if he is in fact town and was just playing like a VI, then I suspect that will become somewhat painfully clear when his replacement arrives. If the replacement shows to be scummy, I'll consider the wagon, but at the present moment, it's not even a consideration.<br>\n<br>\nNisani is a vote I will not cast today. 100%, hands down, not going to happen. Considering I know I'm not the only one who feels this way, I'd say that there's a fair chance that Nisani/Kondi are not realistic lynches today.

Put your input in as to who you want to start the massclaim, and leave it at that. Simply stating \"I think X should start.\" Is sufficient. I've seen too many players just decide to go \"You should claim\" and that person just claims off of that one person. Impressionability is compounded when it's a new player. I want to see a consensus before any fucking claiming is started.<br>\n<br>\nFor the second - replace the words \"him to stay alive\" with \"die.\" Context clues should've given that one away though, c'mon...", "time": "Sat Jul 21, 2012 1:48 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22083&start=850", "forum": "53", "thread": "22083"}

Nisani has not played Mafia in a long time (he said this) and this game is his first in a while. The fact that there is no counterclaim strengthens his claim immensely. In addition, the fact that Nisani *doesn't* have crumbs strengthens my opinion of his claim even further. If the Mafia had daytalk or were allowed to talk pregame and Nisani asked \"What should I do?\" he would have laid down breadcrumbs of some sort. The fact that he didn't breadcrumb *at all*, not even trying to \"fix\" his mistake on D2 shows that Nisani has not been coached or given advice. In addition, looking at his opinions of people after investigating them shows he has some knowledge of the people and while those could be strewn as crumbs, the fact that Nisani did not go to those to imply that he knew I was town or Agar or Elmo before revealing again makes his claim very believable.<br>\n<br>\nRight now I am having a very hard time believing that Agar is town. However, we know that the scum have a roleblocker. As I said earlier I do not understand the balance of this game at all. We have 3 PRs and arguably only 1 whereas the scum seemingly only have a roleblocker. I could understand this as basically being Cop versus Roleblocker and for now I am conceding Agar is town.<br>\n<br>\nOut of the 4 people left that are not confirmed, I had a definitive town read on 1, Kdub, leaning town on another, Oman, and leaning scum on the other two but with caveats for my Hez read. I was in no way expecting for my primary scumtargets to *both* be town and if that isn't a testament to the break that I need to take then I don't know what is.<br>\n<br>\nI am sorry for tunneling on you so hard Nisani and I hope you accept my apology. I am not usually this bad.<br>\n<br>\nWhile I had a problem with Kdub when he first replaced into this game I think he has proven himself to be town. Oman has done relatively nothing and even now doesn't seem to mind the implications that Nisani's claim does. The same goes for Peabody.

Suddenly, Hez is attacking Nisani with vigour, and Oman wants to join the wagon. EVERY SINGLE TIME OMAN WANTS TO JOIN A WAGON HE TRIES TO JUSTIFY IT IN AN EARLIER POST, WITHOUT ACTUALLY VOTING FOR THE WAGON. Oman wants to look consistent. In fact, he's more concerned with looking consistent than finding scum.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n(from Peabody's point of view)<br>\n<br>\nPeabody in #918 claims the three scum are Hez, kdub, Oman.<br>\n<br>\nNisani is already voting Peabody. The game is over if he is right. Therefore, Peabody cannot be right.<br>\n<br>\nIn #805, Peabody declares Oversoul town/town/town. Nisani is clear.

But if this were the case, Peabody would be hammered by now as Nisani has already voted. Therefore, Oversoul can't be mafia and Agar must be mafia. But if Agar is mafia with Hez, it wouldn't matter, because Nisani is voting Peabody and Peabody would be quickhammered.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">The most telling thing in this entire game is that Nisani, who is completely confirmed innocent, has placed his vote on Peabody.

Oversoul cannot be mafia with Agar, as that would give us two godfathers, meaning town-Agar voting me implies that Oversoul can just drop a quickhammer and win the game.<br>\n<br>\ntown-Nisani voting a town-Peabody means that Oversoul can, once again, come in here and drop a quickhammer to win the game.<br>\n<br>\nOversoul is clear.<br>\n<br>\nCONCLUSIONS:<br>\n<br>\nFrom Agar's point of view, Peabody and Oman must be mafia partners TOGETHER.

The night he supposedly neighborized Peabody, he could have been roleblocked or maybe Peabody had a hide or commute power (I think those are normal?).  That type of power would actually kinda make some sense in this setup, especially once the scum know there is a cop.  Mostly speculation here, but the scum might not have a dedicated roleblocker and instead have the JOAT (possibly with a one-shot roleblock) plus another power role like rolecop/tracker/etc.  Godfather is still possible, but seeing a second scum flip as a power role would really reduce that likelihood.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, it's still Oman today, Hez tomorrow.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Oman</span>", "time": "Sat Jul 28, 2012 6:19 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22083&start=975", "forum": "53", "thread": "22083"}

We both made it to the end (where his team won - he was scum, I was town). He has seen my town play and should be quite familiar with it.<br>\n<br>\nHere is the game:<br>\n<br>\nKdub, you will get more out of this if you actually read the parts of the game that involve me. It is a shit-ton, I realize, and I'm not expecting you to read it TODAY. But reading this game will give you more insight into me than any questions, or any ISO of me in this particular game will. Or maybe it won't :shrug:. I'm going to try anyway.<br>\n<br>\nThis is also the reason I requested today to make my argument for tomorrow. Because Oversoul is alive and should be able to vouch for the following:<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">Summary of Paranoia Mafia:</div><br>\n<br>\nThe whole town was against me. Kindof like what you see here. And my playstyle was very similar. In Oversoul's own words from his mafia postgame comments:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><br>\nHez, you were a very good scumhunter as was Amrun. However, it goes without saying that if you cannot make the town agree with you, you have only down half your job. I feel you would be a much deadly force to reckon with both as scum and as town if you would tone down the intensity of your posts. You were *everywhere* this game and part of the reason that the *I* was not afraid of you (well... I was slightly ... no person is that cocky without good reason ) was your erratic day play. Had you honed the scope of your suspicions and stuck with your gut, things would have gone differently. </div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nParanoia Mafia had a lot of town attacking me, and a lot of scum guiding the town in that direction without making it obvious. It was very similar to this game, except that all the scum didn't suddenly slip at LyLo (one of them actually did in Paranoia Mafia but it was too late by then).<br>\n<br>\nBut this game went beyond that. I played an extremely emotional game that was downright close-to-breaking-site-rules at times. I hated it but I couldn't control myself. Let me show you. This you actually have to read (unlike the whole game which is optional but strongly suggested):<br>\n<br>\n- Go to my ISO and read posts #2938, #2949, #2991 (was downright mocking the town), <br>\n- Go to the game and read posts #3100 to #3250. This was scum (that town trusted) basically fishing for information from me, and I refused, and then it was a combination of that scum and MOSTLY TOWN basically trying to quicklynch me, and me getting so angry that OUT OF SPITE I was going to take IMPORTANT INFORMATION to the grave. Why? Because I was incredibly pissed off.<br>\n- Someone in that game asked for a list of games I've played. Post #3415 is that list, if you care. Once again, not required reading.<br>\n<br>\nAs you can see, I was vulgar AND spiteful. I was the exact opposite of someone you would want to play the game with. I was also incredibly angry (I have a difficult time separating my emotions from this game, sadly - but all that emotion is very real).<br>\n<br>\nTwo other things happened in that game.<br>\n- Dana spent the whole game tunneling me. I had an obvtown read on Dana. This is what you're doing, except my read on you is not so strong (it is more PROCESS OF ELIMINATION YAYZ). Nothing I said seemed to matter. We didn't lose the game because of this only because we lost the game before. Scum kept Dana alive for this reason - this is why you will be brought to LyLo - even though you are 100% clear (barring this vote) and Oversoul isn't.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">- More importantly. I had the whole town against me in this game. And the scum. Somehow I wasn't lynched, so every day was a struggle. Only one person had a townread on me. That person believed in me when no one else wouldn't. That person defended me hard and was the only reason I stayed alive that long. When he placed a vote on me at LyLo I practically gave up.</div><br>\n<br>\nThe one person who believed me in a game where no one did. In a game where I was probably breaking site rules out of anger, being completely anti-town out of pure spite, swearing at everyone left and right and just not having a good time at all.<br>\n<br>\nThat person was <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Elmo the Azn</div><br>\n<br>\nThe same person who replaced into kondi's slot ONLY BECAUSE I WAS IN THE GAME AND HE WANTED TO PLAY WITH ME. You saw my reaction - I was so upset when he decided to replace into that particular slot:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Hez Post 464 wrote:</cite>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br>\n<br>\nNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br>\n<br>\nNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br>\n<br>\nELMO IS MY FRIEND.

I fear this post isn't coming across as it should, so I want <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Oversoul to comment on this first</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">There is no fucking way I would nightkill Elmo, or allow him to be nightkilled by my mafia team</div><br>\n<br>\nNot after that game.

That's why I'm throwing this one out there first. I almost feel as if Oversoul HAS to know this fact but it just hasn't crossed his mind. Oversoul, do you really think that I would kill Elmo?

Hez did not hammer Oman today when he had a chance, so that's why if #2 is the case, the non-GF scum has to be Oman.  This means that from my POV, Oman must be scum (again, unless there were only two scum to start).  Now, Oman's flip will be informative.  If he flips goon, then OK, I could maybe see a GF in the setup and I'd consider the possibility carefully.

Then I thought it was one scum tying himself to another in hopes of getting a mislynch after death and further clouding the pools. Agar's lack of comment on Peabody while Peabody actively tries to get something from Agar. Although it does look like an exaggeration from you Hez, Peabody does have interactions and admittedly Agar has less interaction, there are still some. My opinion is that Peabody's questions toward Agar about the Arugula wagon are disingenuous and look designed to try and give Agar some more town credit due to his case. In addition, he at first says he dislikes Agar's reasoning for voting Arugula but then later agrees with the push against Arugula that Agar has posted when the logic was largely the same. Almost as if Peabody needed a reason to go along with Agar at that point (to secure an Arugula mislynch). <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4225115#p4225115\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4225115#p4225115\" data-post-id=\"4225115\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1015</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1281\">HezLucky</a> wrote:</cite>#3 - Please comment on, if you were scum with Oman and Peabody, what you perceive the likelihood of Nisani voting for town-Hez at LyLo would be</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI don't understand this question.

We made it so that Pooky would die first, and then he would have to choose between myself and gorilla in the time (48 hours? 72 hours?) he had remaining alive before the bombs would go off. Neither myself nor gorilla thought the other as scum, but I came up with several reasons why gorilla could be scum (kindof like I am doing here but they weren't as strong and at no point was I completely certain like I am here) - gorilla (who was TOWN) got so angry that he came up with huge cases on me. We basically fought each other hard while scum-Pooky watched and we were both \"so far gone\" by the end that we would have been willing to 1v1 each other BEFORE THE ACTUAL SCUM POOKY would have died.<br>\n<br>\nWhat's my point? gorilla did the town thing.

Well, the town in this game has been utter shit (admit it, it's true) so the scum have been able to direct where they want the wagons. I have been wrong on every single wagon thus far.

Why do I _need_ to have told them this?<br>\n\t- because this couldn't have happened spontaneously. Oman has already shown from today and yesterday that he has no problem voting both myself and Peabody. Therefore, Oman is not averse to bussing. If I were to start a decent attack on Peabody, Oman hopping on is pretty much a given. Unless I told him way way ahead of time not to.<br>\n<br>\n- Since Peabody/Oman largely did not discredit me when I was wrong (or how would the lynches have gone through?), either<br>\na) it's a massive massive coincidence that the ONE person that I was discredited while attacking happens to be alive and in a dichotomy with me at LyLo.<br>\nor<br>\nb) we planned this shit ahead of time, deciding we would pick ONE townie to take all the way to LyLo. Furthermore, I sculpted a damn good attack on Agar in #552 that was FUCKING IGNORED BY THE TOWN. This would require that attack to specifically fail, which we would have no way of knowing.<br>\n<br>\nHere's the biggest problem:<br>\n- town outnumber scum. Town can do whatever the hell they want. If this scenario is true, it is complete luck that we are in this situation to begin with, because one or two \"town\" that agree with Hez when he's right and the plan is ruined.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">That's some convoluted shit </div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nLet's summarize again:<br>\n<br>\n- very simple explanation - I am discredited every time I attack mafia.<br>\n- complicated explanation that requires massive coincidence. I'm sure you will be able to find some explanation for this, but ANY explanation you find will not be as simple and straightforward as the other scenario. That's the point. Mafia is full of luck and WIFOM. Most of mafia plays out that way anyway. And I would never take a WIFOM argument too seriously, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">except here:</div> Why? because the <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">alternative scenario is extremely simple and straightforward</div><br>\n<br>\nWe are talking a situation with NO WIFOM versus a situation with a lot.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">Let's talk about the kills: </div><br>\n<br>\nBBMolla N1<br>\nMykonian N2<br>\nElmo N3<br>\n<br>\nBBMolla and I were in a fight all of D1.<br>\nMykonian died N2. At the closing parts of D2, I had called him scum.<br>\nElmo replaced into the Kondi slot. I had a scumread on Kondi that was very visible all game.<br>\n<br>\nSo basically, if I've called them scum, they've died.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not going to do a \"if Hez is scum/town\" thing here, because I have no clue why the mafia are making the kills they are.<br>\n<br>\nBut \"if Hez is scum\" is pretty simple. Let me ask you one question, the first one I am going to ask:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">#1 - Why would I undermine my own credibility?</div><br>\n<br>\nI can think of one explanation: maybe if people start viewing Hez as the VI he can focus more on looking town and less on constructing actual arguments? iunno.<br>\n<br>\nYou tell me. Every kill is someone I VISIBLY called scum. As in, your first thought upon death should have been \"that's who Hez was accusing\".<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">Have mafia taken every attempt to discredit me? Or have I taken every attempt to discredit myself?</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThis one wasn't as good as I had planned in my head :S. But I planned on making a summary, so hopefully this works:<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Summary of Game</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Hez is town</div><br>\n<br>\n- Mafia killed Elmo, not realizing this is something Hez would not do.<br>\n- Mafia were going for a quickwin and all three piled on Hez at LyLo, expecting at least one person (was there anyone not suspicious of Hez?) to pile on for easy and perfect victory. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">Simple</div><br>\n- Agar-scum has led a lot of bad wagons because he is scum. Any attack on Agar has been defended by Peabody/Oman because scum defend their mafia buddies. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">Simple</div><br>\n- Agar still has confidence because he is scum who does not feel the reprocussions of a mislynch. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">Simple</div><br>\n- Agar's interactions with Peabody are scum-scum. Agar has ignored Peabody because he does not feel threatened by him, and Peabody has called Agar town because a scum does not want their scumbuddy lynched. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">Simple</div><br>\n- Agar uses the chainsaw defense on Arugula when Arugula attacks Oman. Agar spends the whole game calling Oman town. This is because Agar and Oman are mafia buddies. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">Simple</div><br>\n- Agar is ignoring the Peabody/Oman confirmed scum wagons because Agar has stopped bothering to read this game, thinking he had it wrapped up days ago when the cop investigated him. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">Simple</div><br>\n- Agar does not feel the anger that a town would feel when scum are creating mountainous cases on them at LyLo. This is because Agar is not town. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">Simple</div><br>\n- Mafia have killed off Hez's scum-reads to discredit Hez. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">Simple</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Hez is scum</div><br>\n<br>\n- Hez killed off all of the people he called scum for lulz. Mafia agree that Hez discrediting himself all game is a viable strategy. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">WIFOM</div><br>\n- Hez had two of his mafia partners bus him at LyLo for town cred, then Hez turned it around and bussed his two mafia partners in succession, thinking it would be a viable strategy for Hez to go up in LyLo against someone with a cop investigation against them. Hez is fucking crazy, but we will call this <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">WIFOM</div><br>\n- Agar-scum has led a lot of bad wagons because he has had a bad game. Any attack on Agar has been defended by Peabody/Oman because the mafia intended on taking Agar to LyLo at all costs. Also, the only attacks on Agar have been Hez - and the mafia agreed way ahead of time that they would spend the whole game discrediting Hez. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">WIFOM</div><br>\n* In the post where Hez calls Agar/Peabody/Oman the scum-team because those are the three wagons he could never get support for, it is either a massive coincidence that Agar and Hez will be going to LyLo together, or Hez has planned out several days in advance and had every intention of taking Agar to LyLo with him. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">WIFOM</div><br>\n\t* the question is? If Hez is scum, its obvious why Peabody/Oman would have been two people Hez could not lead a wagon on - but how could Hez have known that he would be going to LyLo with Agar, and thus be able to put him as the third? This can't even be planned because Hez's attack on Agar was GOOD at the start of Day 2. By all intentions Agar should have been lynched like that. That is extremely risky for mafia to be relying on town stupidity like that. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">WIFOM</div><br>\n- Also, this scenario requires Hez to have killed Elmo, which I have established he would not, especially so soon after Paranoia Mafia.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThat's what it comes down to. Hez is either scum who has crafted a very convoluted web - which is possible, and I don't blame you for thinking that. What I do blame you for is the fact that the alternate explanation is so damn simple. Yes, most mafia games have massive WIFOM attached to them. So you have every right to be paranoid or suspicious.<br>\n<br>\nBut not in this case. This is not WIFOM versus WIFOM like most mafia games.<br>\n<br>\nThis is SIMPLE versus WIFOM.<br>\n<br>\nA new player would get this right - every single time.<br>\n<br>\nMaybe you do think that I am brilliant enough to weave a web of WIFOM. Sure. But I cannot control Agar's play - and Agar's play is the one that's incriminating here. My play yield paranoia, but his play is just flat out scum - and not something I could have planned if I were scum.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">I have one final request: I don't know which of you will be going into LyLo tomorrow. I request that I get to place my vote on Agar before you vote. This is because<br>\na) I would like some final words.<br>\nb) If there is anything more that needs to be covered I want to cover it.<br>\n<br>\nSo this is question #2<br>\n<br>\n#2 - Comment on any of the above that you feel fit _AND_ please agree to my request.</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI wish this was stronger.
