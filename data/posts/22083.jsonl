With the wave of a hand, 12 chairs in a circle materialize in the middle of the room. The black figure instantly changes into an elderly man, the visage of a wizened teacher, complete with liver spots, wrinkles, and scholarly harry potter-esq spectactles. <br><br>Without any delay, students start blinking into the chairs without any order. Within the span of several seconds, all the chairs are filled with students from all over the globe, represented by all races and genders. A motley crew of youngsters, some of them start laughing and playing amongst themselves, while others just sit perfectly still, completely uninterested in the prospect of social interaction. <br><br>\"Class, today I have something very special for you.\" - the avatar of the old teacher said. Whether their teacher actually looked like that or if it was just an idol designed to create an impression of wisdom, they didnt know. They respected him regardless, as this particular Teacher-Intelligence was over 200 years old.<br><br>\"Roughly a thousand years ago, in the Age of Upheaval, about 30 years before the first singularity burst - there existed a game people used to play. People dont play it anymore as we have constructs that are about a million times more sophisticated, but nonetheless today you will learn about the people of mafiascum.net\"<br><br>Several of the students sighed, while others accessed any data they could on the subject instantly. One of the latter spoke up.<br><br>\"There is very little data available about that site, TI-Tiemaetre\"<br><br>\"Ha! That is because most data from that time is lost forever. But I have trawled enough information from various cached sources that will allow me to teach you what it was about.\"<br><br>Suddenly, in a millisecond, each of the students were granted the knowledge and rules of the game of mafia as played on mafiascum.net a thousand years ago by way of a TI.exe program sent directly into their memory. The teacher smiled. The students started chattering amongst themselves, as personal messaging was not allowed in the presence of a TI. Even some of the more stoic students seemed interested.</span><br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800040\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Game Play, Etiquette, Basics</span></span></span><br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>1a.

These include disparaging comments on race, religion, age, gender, orientation, or similar characteristics. I will only moderate politeness in the thread for extreme situations, but keep in mind it\u2019s just a game and act accordingly. <br><br>3a. This is a closed game. Roles may not be quoted in any form. No mod PM may be quoted in any form. Very small, invisible or encrypted text is not allowed. <br><br>4a. No forms of cryptography. This includes using ciphers, encrypted text, etc. You aren't a spy in WWII, you're a dude playing some mafia.<br><br>5a. No \"Trust Tells\" - Trust Tells are specific tells that absolutely verify a fact beyond the reasonable doubt associated with mafia games. Common examples of Trust Tells are Red Text of Truth and Pooky Promise. However, a couple of other Trust Tells exist specific to the person using them. All Trust Tells can be broken, but only for specific people and are almost universally always correct. The only time a Trust Tell is broken is when people sacrifice the ability to use the infinitely usually confirming themselves as town to win a single game as Mafia or a Third Party.

This is not a fucking stretch don't say it is [and I still don't see what you do - at all. Look at the fact that Nisani has basically disappeared off the face of the Earth while this wagon has started on me. Nisani is playing the VI card. Look at his one post before I started attacking him - his tone is completely different from that of a VI. PLEASE TELL ME YOU SEE THIS. Everything Nisani has done has been crafted - whether by him or someone else. That, and the counterwagon on me is just terrible]<br><br>We also seem to agree on Kondi-scum, who is doing more than shameless bandwagoning at this point.<br><br><br><br>Tajun has literally done nothing but post one wall tunneling on me and then disappeared. Tajun, please show up and comment on the rest of the game [ie. not just me]. Tajun could definitely be opportunistic scum BUT this could also be town who really really hates my playstyle and is tunneling on me early [and the sad thing is? If this IS town he's probably getting lynched for being on this wagon]<br><br>So which one is he? TAJUN POST MORE. You are tunneling town or obvscum. You know why I've changed my tune and am leaning the first now? Your reads. They are<br>a) terrible to have if you are scum. You have null reads on like half the game.<br>b) You have Peabody and Arugula as town, BOTH OF WHOM ARE ON THE NISANI WAGON. You have Mallard and Agar as null-scum, BOTH OF WHOM WERE VOTING ME EARLIER TODAY. This might be meaningless but I want you to answer this question: based on WHO is on the wagon, which wagon looks better? Me or Nisani?<br><br>Of course I know better than to preach to tunneling townies, so if you get lynched tomorrow and cost us the game please quit the site and go elsewhere. Your lack of effort into this game is not appreciated. <br><br><br>Nisani is scum. I've already outlined why and so have several others. More telling things:<br><br>- he has disappeared. Town don't tend to completely disappear when they are under pressure. Noobscum DO. HARD. And this counterwagon, so blatant and obvious. And nearly all of the people are citing playstyle issues OR lurking hardcore OR (see below). How anyone on my wagon can think they are in good company is beyond me.<br><br><br><br>Kondi is mafia unless Nisani is mafia. If Nisani is mafia, one of BBmolla/Kondi is pretty much 100% mafia. If Nisani is not mafia, Kondi and BBmolla are BOTH mafia [but PLEASE LYNCH BBMOLLA FIRST DO NOT IGNORE THIS POINT]<br><br>I never originally outlined why Kondi was mafia - I feared that if I was onto something I would be killed. Let me tell you the ORIGINAL reasons why Kondi is mafia:<br><br>1) He has done absolutely nothing with his early questions. I'm talking about these:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Nisani: Link to a town and a scum game.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Hez, what was the most recently finished game you were town in?</div></blockquote><br><br>He has not used this information in any way to help him decide who is mafia. He is merely hopping bandwagons and hardcore-buddying BBmolla [this is why Nisani can be mafia without BBmolla being mafia -- we would have a Nisani/Kondi combination. HOWEVER I THINK BBMOLLA IS MORE LIKELY TO BE MAFIA THAN KONDI]<br><br>So, one more time for those of you who can't read:<br><br>1) early questions attempting to look town, but has not used this information in any way to HELP HIM DECIDE THE WAGON. He's just hopping.<br>2) the hardcore buddying of BBmolla -- <span class=\"noboldsig\">Kondi is in a position right now where he really doesn't want to upset the town leaders - he declared me town for the first several days, then when BBmolla stepped up his aggression on me he buddied Molla instead with the hope that it would eliminate another town leader in myself</span><br><br>I guarantee one of BBmolla and Kondi is mafia. If Nisani is town, they are probably both mafia.<br><br><br>The last mafia? Off my wagon. I don't care who it is they will slip up later."}

I'm leaning toward a Kondi-scum regardless of Nisani's alignment.  <br><br>I don't think people have been 'crafting' Nisani's posts.  He's been consistently the same person with the same alignment peaking out of his words.

I've noticed the town has split in two over his alignment.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Oversoul wrote:</cite>Peabody, the fact that you can see the motivation of town in the post proves my point that this could Nisani playing a game that is much too aggressive for his normal playstyle.</div></blockquote><br>I'm still not seeing how an aggressive Nisani means town.

This is called good town play, a concept seemingly unfamiliar to you. Half of being a good town player is finding scum. The other half is convincing other people to vote for the scum you find. You need both of those skills to succeed. Anyways, back to my point. If you are impressed by the case and say \"Why golly, I see that AGar very well could be scum!\" and vote for me, other town players are now going to look at the case. If it's a good case, then you're going to be justified. If it's not a good case, then people are going to slam a rope around your throat and we'll <span style=\"font-style: italic\">break your fucking neck.</span><br><br>The same can be applied to Oman. There is nothing whatsoever scummy about a player saying \"I can be convinced to vote for X with a case.\" That's simply inviting good town play. If one of you presents a good case on Nisani, Oman decides it's good and jumps on it, there's really nothing wrong with that. If you present a shit case (basically what all of you have been bringing forth anyways), and Oman jumps on it (note that he hasn't), then yes - we're going to find Oman very fishy for suddenly 180-ing on Nisani.<br><br>But none of this has actually happened and you basically just showed me you're scum so thanks."}

It seems this game, his style has been to tunnel and then to clear the person he tunneled or to seriously doubt himself.  Based on the little meta I've read of him, this looks like it's consistent with his playstyle as town.<br><br>I feel like my vote on Elmo is wasted where it is but I cannot shake kondi's earlier play out of my mind.  The biggest chunk of evidence I have on kondi that makes my scumdar go off like crazy.. It was too much 'lemme read your game' and such with no follow-up.  It looked like a forced persona that wasn't followed through.  <br><br>Nisani has managed to hide after the microscope was on him.  He's leaning more scum than town at this point.<br><br>Common Man is replacing out, and I look forward to seeing his replacement's play.  I'm getting more scum than null.<br><br>Waiting for knox's reply.<br><br>I haven't heard much from Oman except for that he was thinking about a Hezscum possibility, and that Agar is town.  Oman, who is your top scum pick and why?"}

From this list, the most likely are Nisani, CommonMan, Oman, or Knox.  I think Oversoul is more likely town.  His jumping off wagons looked suspicious at first, but now after his retracted case on kdub, I'm feeling a little better about him.<br><br>Aside from this analysis, Elmo is most likely to be scum.  The kondi questions at the beginning with no followup ARE GNAWING AT MY MIND.  That being said, I agree with the Elmo wagon.  I would also approve of an Oman wagon at least for information purposes if nothing else (but that will come when the deadline isn't so close).    I've been liking Mykonian's posts so far, so I want to hold off on a CommonMan wagon."}

Elmo hasn't done anything.  I can't see how you can say he has been \"much better\".  Less scummy?  OK, but that's pretty easy when he isn't posting anything.  Also, you haven't indicated any sort of confidence in a mykonian lynch at all, you just said you were sheeping AGar."}

I don't see a reason for scum-Elmo to claim compulsive neighborizer, because it locks him into an action every night and he could be caught by trackers/watchers/etc.  I also don't see a good reason for scum to block his action, since neighborizer is a fairly weak PR.<br><br>I think we have two options at the moment.

Put your input in as to who you want to start the massclaim, and leave it at that. Simply stating \"I think X should start.\" Is sufficient. I've seen too many players just decide to go \"You should claim\" and that person just claims off of that one person. Impressionability is compounded when it's a new player.

Nisani has not played Mafia in a long time (he said this) and this game is his first in a while. The fact that there is no counterclaim strengthens his claim immensely. In addition, the fact that Nisani *doesn't* have crumbs strengthens my opinion of his claim even further. If the Mafia had daytalk or were allowed to talk pregame and Nisani asked \"What should I do?\" he would have laid down breadcrumbs of some sort. The fact that he didn't breadcrumb *at all*, not even trying to \"fix\" his mistake on D2 shows that Nisani has not been coached or given advice. In addition, looking at his opinions of people after investigating them shows he has some knowledge of the people and while those could be strewn as crumbs, the fact that Nisani did not go to those to imply that he knew I was town or Agar or Elmo before revealing again makes his claim very believable.<br><br>Right now I am having a very hard time believing that Agar is town. However, we know that the scum have a roleblocker. As I said earlier I do not understand the balance of this game at all. We have 3 PRs and arguably only 1 whereas the scum seemingly only have a roleblocker.

He has also placed a second vote on me without hesitation at LyLo. Agar's attack today against me has been planned. He knew coming in that he would try to push a lynch against me. His vote against me doesn't read at all like someone who is thinking things out, but rather justifying a vote rather than leading to it through reasoning. You can justify a vote against anyone, but Agar did not come to his conclusion naturally.<br><br>Peabody was even more opportunistic, and should be the lynch today. I am a bad scumhunter, except at LyLo. Why? Scum make themselves fucking obvious. Oversoul can attest go look at Paranoia Mafia. I sucked until the end, where I found basically all of them and it was too late. Peabody is the first scum that has made himself fucking obvious. He has lurked in the background somewhat,strategically inputting his thoughts when he feels its a good time, and has buddied me constantly (likely this was discussed in the mafia quicktopic). As Oversoul is attesting to, the scum are keeping me alive to do their dirty work. I attack everyone - and the scum are subtly pushing the wagons in the direction of town.<br><br>Last scum is Oman. Process of Elimination. It's not me. It's not Nisani. It's not Oversoul (It's not fucking Oversoul give me a fucking break if you think its him at this point gg). Between him and kdub, kdub reads far more legitimate. Once again, scum are making themselves obvious. Oman in his posting on this page has basically come out and said \"HEY LOOK GUYS I AM TRYING TO GRADUALLY PUSH EVERYONE TOWARDS A HEZ VOTE WITHOUT COMMITING ON IT. THIS IS BECAUSE WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ANY TOWN ON THIS WAGON YET\". Welcome to LyLo.

The night he supposedly neighborized Peabody, he could have been roleblocked or maybe Peabody had a hide or commute power (I think those are normal?).  That type of power would actually kinda make some sense in this setup, especially once the scum know there is a cop.  Mostly speculation here, but the scum might not have a dedicated roleblocker and instead have the JOAT (possibly with a one-shot roleblock) plus another power role like rolecop/tracker/etc.  Godfather is still possible, but seeing a second scum flip as a power role would really reduce that likelihood.<br><br>Anyway, it's still Oman today, Hez tomorrow.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Oman</span>"}

We both made it to the end (where his team won - he was scum, I was town). He has seen my town play and should be quite familiar with it.<br><br>Here is the game:<br><br>Kdub, you will get more out of this if you actually read the parts of the game that involve me. It is a shit-ton, I realize, and I'm not expecting you to read it TODAY. But reading this game will give you more insight into me than any questions, or any ISO of me in this particular game will. Or maybe it won't :shrug:. I'm going to try anyway.<br><br>This is also the reason I requested today to make my argument for tomorrow. Because Oversoul is alive and should be able to vouch for the following:<br><br><br><br><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Summary of Paranoia Mafia:</span></span><br><br>The whole town was against me. Kindof like what you see here. And my playstyle was very similar. In Oversoul's own words from his mafia postgame comments:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Hez, you were a very good scumhunter as was Amrun. However, it goes without saying that if you cannot make the town agree with you, you have only down half your job. I feel you would be a much deadly force to reckon with both as scum and as town if you would tone down the intensity of your posts. You were *everywhere* this game and part of the reason that the *I* was not afraid of you (well... I was slightly ... no person is that cocky without good reason ) was your erratic day play. Had you honed the scope of your suspicions and stuck with your gut, things would have gone differently. </div></blockquote><br><br>Paranoia Mafia had a lot of town attacking me, and a lot of scum guiding the town in that direction without making it obvious. It was very similar to this game, except that all the scum didn't suddenly slip at LyLo (one of them actually did in Paranoia Mafia but it was too late by then).<br><br>But this game went beyond that. I played an extremely emotional game that was downright close-to-breaking-site-rules at times. I hated it but I couldn't control myself. Let me show you. This you actually have to read (unlike the whole game which is optional but strongly suggested):<br><br>- Go to my ISO and read posts #2938, #2949, #2991 (was downright mocking the town), <br>- Go to the game and read posts #3100 to #3250. This was scum (that town trusted) basically fishing for information from me, and I refused, and then it was a combination of that scum and MOSTLY TOWN basically trying to quicklynch me, and me getting so angry that OUT OF SPITE I was going to take IMPORTANT INFORMATION to the grave. Why? Because I was incredibly pissed off.<br>- Someone in that game asked for a list of games I've played. Post #3415 is that list, if you care. Once again, not required reading.<br><br>As you can see, I was vulgar AND spiteful. I was the exact opposite of someone you would want to play the game with. I was also incredibly angry (I have a difficult time separating my emotions from this game, sadly - but all that emotion is very real).<br><br>Two other things happened in that game.<br>- Dana spent the whole game tunneling me. I had an obvtown read on Dana. This is what you're doing, except my read on you is not so strong (it is more PROCESS OF ELIMINATION YAYZ). Nothing I said seemed to matter. We didn't lose the game because of this only because we lost the game before. Scum kept Dana alive for this reason - this is why you will be brought to LyLo - even though you are 100% clear (barring this vote) and Oversoul isn't.<br><br><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">- More importantly. I had the whole town against me in this game. And the scum. Somehow I wasn't lynched, so every day was a struggle. Only one person had a townread on me. That person believed in me when no one else wouldn't. That person defended me hard and was the only reason I stayed alive that long. When he placed a vote on me at LyLo I practically gave up.</span></span><br><br>The one person who believed me in a game where no one did. In a game where I was probably breaking site rules out of anger, being completely anti-town out of pure spite, swearing at everyone left and right and just not having a good time at all.<br><br>That person was <span class=\"noboldsig\">Elmo the Azn</span><br><br>The same person who replaced into kondi's slot ONLY BECAUSE I WAS IN THE GAME AND HE WANTED TO PLAY WITH ME. You saw my reaction - I was so upset when he decided to replace into that particular slot:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Hez Post 464 wrote:</cite>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br><br>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br><br>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br><br>ELMO IS MY FRIEND.

This means that from my POV, Oman must be scum (again, unless there were only two scum to start).  Now, Oman's flip will be informative.  If he flips goon, then OK, I could maybe see a GF in the setup and I'd consider the possibility carefully.

If you are scum, there are plenty of reasons why the scum may have acted in the way they did.<br><br>I think the thing that's bothering me a bit is that I have been relatively ignored since lylo, especially since Oman was giving some indications that he could start suspecting me.  I've been pretty far off this game, similar to AGar, and with Nisani's cop result, I was really expecting an uphill battle to win out over three competent players in Peabody/Oman/Hez.  I need to think more about why things haven't turned out that way."}

[aka. the dead, flipped scum and the soon-to-be dead, flipped scum]</div></blockquote><br><br>I have noticed Agar and Oman's buddy buddy interaction and at first I thought this was a friend from outside Mafia (Oman has lots of friends \"outside\" the Mafia playing forums) and that was why the sheeping and the defensive was occuring. Then I thought it was one scum tying himself to another in hopes of getting a mislynch after death and further clouding the pools. Agar's lack of comment on Peabody while Peabody actively tries to get something from Agar. Although it does look like an exaggeration from you Hez, Peabody does have interactions and admittedly Agar has less interaction, there are still some. My opinion is that Peabody's questions toward Agar about the Arugula wagon are disingenuous and look designed to try and give Agar some more town credit due to his case. In addition, he at first says he dislikes Agar's reasoning for voting Arugula but then later agrees with the push against Arugula that Agar has posted when the logic was largely the same. Almost as if Peabody needed a reason to go along with Agar at that point (to secure an Arugula mislynch). <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4225115#p4225115\" class=\"postlink\">post 1015</a>, HezLucky wrote:</cite>#3 - Please comment on, if you were scum with Oman and Peabody, what you perceive the likelihood of Nisani voting for town-Hez at LyLo would be</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't understand this question.

Neither myself nor gorilla thought the other as scum, but I came up with several reasons why gorilla could be scum (kindof like I am doing here but they weren't as strong and at no point was I completely certain like I am here) - gorilla (who was TOWN) got so angry that he came up with huge cases on me.

Oman has already shown from today and yesterday that he has no problem voting both myself and Peabody. Therefore, Oman is not averse to bussing. If I were to start a decent attack on Peabody, Oman hopping on is pretty much a given. Unless I told him way way ahead of time not to.<br><br>- Since Peabody/Oman largely did not discredit me when I was wrong (or how would the lynches have gone through?), either<br>a) it's a massive massive coincidence that the ONE person that I was discredited while attacking happens to be alive and in a dichotomy with me at LyLo.<br>or<br>b) we planned this shit ahead of time, deciding we would pick ONE townie to take all the way to LyLo. Furthermore, I sculpted a damn good attack on Agar in #552 that was FUCKING IGNORED BY THE TOWN.

I'm sure you will be able to find some explanation for this, but ANY explanation you find will not be as simple and straightforward as the other scenario. That's the point. Mafia is full of luck and WIFOM. Most of mafia plays out that way anyway. And I would never take a WIFOM argument too seriously, <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">except here:</span></span> Why? because the <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">alternative scenario is extremely simple and straightforward</span></span><br><br>We are talking a situation with NO WIFOM versus a situation with a lot.<br><br><br><br><br><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Let's talk about the kills: </span></span><br><br>BBMolla N1<br>Mykonian N2<br>Elmo N3<br><br>BBMolla and I were in a fight all of D1.<br>Mykonian died N2.

Every kill is someone I VISIBLY called scum.

Or have I taken every attempt to discredit myself?</span></span><br><br><br><br><br><br>This one wasn't as good as I had planned in my head :S. But I planned on making a summary, so hopefully this works:<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Summary of Game</span><br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Hez is town</span><br><br>- Mafia killed Elmo, not realizing this is something Hez would not do.<br>- Mafia were going for a quickwin and all three piled on Hez at LyLo, expecting at least one person (was there anyone not suspicious of Hez?) to pile on for easy and perfect victory. <span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Simple</span></span><br>- Agar-scum has led a lot of bad wagons because he is scum. Any attack on Agar has been defended by Peabody/Oman because scum defend their mafia buddies. <span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Simple</span></span><br>- Agar still has confidence because he is scum who does not feel the reprocussions of a mislynch. <span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Simple</span></span><br>- Agar's interactions with Peabody are scum-scum. Agar has ignored Peabody because he does not feel threatened by him, and Peabody has called Agar town because a scum does not want their scumbuddy lynched. <span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Simple</span></span><br>- Agar uses the chainsaw defense on Arugula when Arugula attacks Oman. Agar spends the whole game calling Oman town. This is because Agar and Oman are mafia buddies. <span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Simple</span></span><br>- Agar is ignoring the Peabody/Oman confirmed scum wagons because Agar has stopped bothering to read this game, thinking he had it wrapped up days ago when the cop investigated him. <span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Simple</span></span><br>- Agar does not feel the anger that a town would feel when scum are creating mountainous cases on them at LyLo. This is because Agar is not town. <span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Simple</span></span><br>- Mafia have killed off Hez's scum-reads to discredit Hez. <span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Simple</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Hez is scum</span><br><br>- Hez killed off all of the people he called scum for lulz. Mafia agree that Hez discrediting himself all game is a viable strategy. <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">WIFOM</span></span><br>- Hez had two of his mafia partners bus him at LyLo for town cred, then Hez turned it around and bussed his two mafia partners in succession, thinking it would be a viable strategy for Hez to go up in LyLo against someone with a cop investigation against them. Hez is fucking crazy, but we will call this <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">WIFOM</span></span><br>- Agar-scum has led a lot of bad wagons because he has had a bad game. Any attack on Agar has been defended by Peabody/Oman because the mafia intended on taking Agar to LyLo at all costs. Also, the only attacks on Agar have been Hez - and the mafia agreed way ahead of time that they would spend the whole game discrediting Hez. <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">WIFOM</span></span><br>* In the post where Hez calls Agar/Peabody/Oman the scum-team because those are the three wagons he could never get support for, it is either a massive coincidence that Agar and Hez will be going to LyLo together, or Hez has planned out several days in advance and had every intention of taking Agar to LyLo with him. <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">WIFOM</span></span><br>\t* the question is? If Hez is scum, its obvious why Peabody/Oman would have been two people Hez could not lead a wagon on - but how could Hez have known that he would be going to LyLo with Agar, and thus be able to put him as the third? This can't even be planned because Hez's attack on Agar was GOOD at the start of Day 2. By all intentions Agar should have been lynched like that. That is extremely risky for mafia to be relying on town stupidity like that. <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">WIFOM</span></span><br>- Also, this scenario requires Hez to have killed Elmo, which I have established he would not, especially so soon after Paranoia Mafia.<br><br><br><br><br>That's what it comes down to. Hez is either scum who has crafted a very convoluted web - which is possible, and I don't blame you for thinking that. What I do blame you for is the fact that the alternate explanation is so damn simple. Yes, most mafia games have massive WIFOM attached to them. So you have every right to be paranoid or suspicious.<br><br>But not in this case. This is not WIFOM versus WIFOM like most mafia games.<br><br>This is SIMPLE versus WIFOM.<br><br>A new player would get this right - every single time.<br><br>Maybe you do think that I am brilliant enough to weave a web of WIFOM. Sure. But I cannot control Agar's play - and Agar's play is the one that's incriminating here. My play yield paranoia, but his play is just flat out scum - and not something I could have planned if I were scum.<br><br><br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">I have one final request: I don't know which of you will be going into LyLo tomorrow. I request that I get to place my vote on Agar before you vote. This is because<br>a) I would like some final words.<br>b) If there is anything more that needs to be covered I want to cover it.<br><br>So this is question #2<br><br>#2 - Comment on any of the above that you feel fit _AND_ please agree to my request.</span><br><br><br>I wish this was stronger. It is so much stronger in my head. Whatever. Have a hezwavre.<br><br>HEZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZWAVRE"}

You are also immune to investigations and will always turn up innocent.<br><br>You win when the mafia outnumbers the town/kills them all, your partners are X and X though you may not speak with them during the night or in any space outside the thread.<br></code></dd></dl></div></div></div><br><br>RGAM:<br><span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">(10:10am May 24th, 2012)</span><br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><iframe width=\"420\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DLY_qLkWMXk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></div><br><br>Endgame Chill Music:<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><iframe width=\"420\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lwErxckY-Xc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></div><br><br>Hope you had fun!"}
