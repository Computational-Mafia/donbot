He reads the scummy side of null to me at this point, and since a lot of what he's done so far seems to be (a dry sarcastic form of) humor, I've long since retired calling someone out as scum for trying to be funny their first couple posts.

It boils down to calling iceninja (basically) condescending for nay saying all of use voting for Garmr, a half baked justification for lack of logic (look at my user title LOL), and 3 posts of teaching grandmothers to suck eggs on why his wonderous list will hand the scum the game.<br>\nand at the end there, again, asking someon else to do the leg work, instead of explaining to Ice WHY he has a vote on Garmr, he demands Ice tell him WHY he SHOULDN'T have a vote on Garmr.  I'm not familiar with his play style, but it seems very lazy or deliberately nothingness.  The placement of the vote bothers me most.  If Slandaar is your biggest suspect why is your vote not on him?  This going for anything for a bandwagon is a bad disease, several players seem to have it and it bugs me.

It's like getting blood from a stone to get thoughts from most of you.<br>\n<br>\nI completely disagree with Slandaars case against thor and I am mixed on the Albert's case against Thor. I was initially going to discard Albert's case that Thor was acting out of form for his townplay as my brief experiences playing with him had him down as one of those force of nature players who played every game the same way, sticking close to his namesake head butting everybody norse style. (I think I've only had one game with him, but he might have been in another game with me that was lost in the great tiger crash of 2012) <br>\n<br>\nBut I quick recap of that game does show some truth to Albert's comment that town Thor does not appear to normally make calls to lynch. But the game I played him with was a unique circumstance. So I will review the three games Thor provided.<br>\n<br>\nI am somewhat settled by Slandaars responses, I would not consider him town yet and I still do feel he is putting far too much blame on thor for the battle of the walls which I still disagree with him on.<br>\n<br>\nother major suspicions I have is Axxle, Macros and Guthrie. Sadly the lurking/absence of Axxle has stalled any development on him and guthrie has gone and done the same. Macros I feel looked very bad for his actions involved the Garmr wagon. I dont see why a town player needed to be pushed to make his vote and I find the whine post he followed it up with to be very suspicous.<br>\n<br>\nI guess outside them most people fall into the null catagory, the closest I have to people I would be comfortable in saying they are playing like town is only Iceninja. I dont think there is much of case for Garmr to be scum, but he hasnt reassured me as a competent player and toolenduso appears well meaning but neutral. He does confirm with Thor that Slandaar misrepped him, but he doesnt act on it, instead keeping his vote on albert.

So, expect lots of content on interesting things.<br>\n<br>\nThe trouble is I am unsure who actually is scum due to the number of possibilities, Thor I am pretty sure is but then this always happens and maybe he is just this naive to think that he shouldn't change his method of reading me or at least should leave me to post for a bit before coming to any conclusions. When I say always happens its happened 2/2 where we were both town, this is why the case is so strong because of the timing in the meta between us.

(In this scenario probably the second game its more applicable but you get the point)<br>\n<br>\nThere is no reason for in a 3rd game to stick to exactly the same method when it has not worked prior and magically it happened again so in the situation Thor is town here it definitely does not work but Thor will continue in a 4th game the exact same strategy to read me? REALLY?<br>\n<br>\nThat is where it makes no sense and that is Thors 'defence'; he wouldn't change methods.<br>\n<br>\nOut of context what this means is Thor has said he doesn't mind being wrong on one or two people all the time as he wouldn't make exceptions to how he scumhunts individuals which is clearly terrible if you have meta on someone you should use it.

I am always aggressive (this is the meta part) therefore the playstyle aspects of what I did are not really telling...and at that point I'm not sure what the case is (there's a reason ABR is refusing to even discuss that other than to just keep screaming it's 'different' somehow...yeah)<br>\n<br>\n2. The only way I was uninterested in conversation (an ironic tell being leveled at someone that has been asked to stop posting so much) is if people believe I literally expect all conversation to end because I ask it to...I mean, seriously. That's like me saying 'Go die now' and then to be accussed of wanting that person to literally, in the real world, die. I'm frankly in a mix of bemusement and frustration that this is even part of a case. Also, again, this is a meta aspect insomuch as I *often* say things like that, so therefore ieven if all of you think it is something only scum would say (which I can't argue about other than to suggest you're all insane) it is not something I only say as scum, nor is it something I think scum are benefited by saying. Ergo - still not a good tell.<br>\n<br>\n3. I also asked *you* specifically if there was ANYTHING you felt I hadn't addressed.<br>\n<br>\nApparently it is \"well, you addressed your case but not in the way I wanted you to...\"<br>\n<br>\nUm...whu?<br>\nSeriously, it's a playstyle tell, if I don't go into my meta then my defense to the case becomes as silly as the case you are all buying into.<br>\nAGGRESSIVE PLAYERS ARE NOT ALWAYS SCUM, BUT CAN BE AGGRESSIVE TOWN, AND SOME PLAYERS, AS TOWN OR SCUM, LIKE TO PRESS WAGONS IN A WAY THAT EXPRESSES DESIRE OF INSTANT LYNCH IN ORDER TO ADD REAL PRESSURE TO THE PLAYERS THEY ARE VOTING - AND I BELIEVE IN HIS PLAYSTYLE MORE THAN THE PLAYSTYLE WHEREIN BEING AGGRESSIVE IS SCUMMY, AND SAYING 'SPEEDLYNCH' AUTOMATICALLY MEANS A SPEEDLYNCH HAPPENS.<br>\n<br>\nThere.<br>\nThat's about as much as one can do without going into meta and it's *still* touching on meta insomuch as it's discussing playstyle.<br>\nBut that's because the case against me is a ephemeral meta based concept.<br>\nI can't even describe nor think of what serious points have been raised against me that I can address - can you tell me what they are? I'll do it.<br>\nUntil then I am annoyed you're leveling another smurfy derp mud slap at me and acting like you're doing anything. Seriously, what am I even supposed to say to a complaint like that?<br>\nI also used meta when addressing your case on ABR and that had nothing to do with me or a case on me.<br>\nShock.<br>\nMaybe I use meta more than you, it's probably a scumtell because Thor thinks meta is relevant and should be discussed, especially about cases based on meta.", "time": "Mon Oct 14, 2013 2:18 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=31972&start=325", "forum": "53", "thread": "31972"}

I skimmed through this game but will re-read in more Detail tonight. <br>\n<br>\nI am unsure about the debate between Albert and Thor. I have read one game of Albert's (the one linked on the \"<a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=A_Beautiful_Guide_to_Focusing_on_Scum_and_Getting_them_Lynched\" class=\"postlink\">A beautiful guide to focussing on scum and getting them lynched</a>.\" wiki article. My thoughts were that Albert's pushes in that game were a lot more forceful and pushy as opposed to his push on Thor here where I get a more laid-back feeling. It could be circumstantial considering the impending deadline in the other game. I'll double check with other games to see if there is a common pattern. I've played two games with Thor but haven't picked up on any meta-tells that were useful. I'll read the posted games to verify whether Albert's case is accurate.<br>\n<br>\nI think IceNinja is likely scum. A lot of his earlier posts gave me a bad gut feeling. I don't like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5366864#p5366864\">326 </a>or <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5366864#p5366864\">331 </a>. I find meta to be a very useful tool and IceNinja's dismissal of Thor's case based on the fact that he is referring to his meta to be a poor argument. 331 where he essentially says \"fair enough, carry on\" is terrible. Also he wants to do a VCA but declines to put his vote down? <br>\n<br>\nI think VCA's are useless but IceNinja clearly thinks that they are useful.

Mostly because of how ridiculous things are.<br>\n<br>\nThe thing that stands out most to me right now is ABR trying to control town with force of personality as opposed to good reasoning or scum hunting. When I first attacked him, ABR overwhelmed me and basically intimidated me out of my scum read on him and I hadn't even really realized it happened. Now he's trying to do the same thing to Thor, and has obviously unbalanced him to a degree (as I've noticed the \"flailing\" that ABR refers to as well) but I don't think it's because Thor is scum and caught, I think it is simply because Thor is frustrated.<br>\n<br>\nThe tone I've been getting a lot from Thor's posts, and a good example of this would be his recent read of me as per F-16's request, is that he's frustrated about how stupid town is that we aren't seeing what he's seeing. It reminds me very much of how I was feeling in my most recent game where it was so obvious to me that a certain player had to be scum based on setup analysis (I ended up being wrong because a fucking VT claimed power role, <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">don't fucking claim a power role if you're a VT.

I'll try to make sense of them though. The bolded things are what I wrote down in my phone.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Thor's \"speedlynch\"</div><br>\nThor eventually touched on this but I thought that the argument against him that stated he was calling for a speedlynch was really dumb. It's not like a speedlynch would actually happen. It's just something to emphasize his read on the player.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Slandaar's reach on tool</div><br>\nSlandaar's original case on tool was a really big stretch and Slandaar usually makes big openings. This game I was disappointed and found his initial push bad, which is unlike him. In the whole Thor-Slandaar-Albert debate, I think there's at least one scum, and I was thinking it was Slandaar until recently. I'll talk more about that later.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Axxle using the word barometer</div><br>\nThis is probably dumb but I found it odd that after Thor used the word barometer to gauge newbiness, Axxle also used it. I don't know if he's subtly aligning his play to Thor or it was just a word in his mind.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Garmr's \"you guys want more fine\"</div><br>\nI really didn't like this at all. You should always have your reads out on the table. When something asks you for more and you go \"ugh fine\" and churn out some content, it's scummy.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Garmr 173 scumslip</div><br>\nLooking back this isn't as bad as I thought it was.

Ice has literally the exact opposite feelings. I found it weird that TCold didn't address Ice at all there.<br>\n<br>\nAs far as the Albert-Thor-Slandaar trifecta battle royale, I thought Slandaar was scum for his weak reasoning but Albert's \"lol jk the case on you is fake. You should be scared of me though\" bugs me the wrong way. It's like he realized he was wrong and came up with that after the fact. I also dislike his subsequent insistence that Thor is scummy for overreacting in his response? If he didn't jump on it, it would be scummy, so it's kind of a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't situation. Also, I think it was Sir Bastion who pointed out how Albert didn't question those who followed his fake case on Thor.

If Thor had still been voting Slandaar and pushing to lynch him today based on the misrep over the last 2 pages then slandaar has a case for scummy behaviour. But he hasnt, the game has moved on.

That's not a mistake, it's a real challenge. I can't say who is scum for certain, but out of everyone, Thor is playing the most black and white, and therefore I think he's the scum. He started as a gut read, back when I thought he was defending me with meta. I chose that time to go against him. I derailed the wagon on him because of my own doubts. Not because \"I was going to get caught\". If I stayed on Thor, it would be in the same shoes as Slandaar right now, exchanging wall posts with Thor, each arguing our points without ever agreeing. There was a chance he was going to get lynched as well, which I wasn't prepared  to take responsibility for. The reason why I asked Slandaar if he was certain about Thor, that he would not unvote once Thor gained a bigger bandwagon, was because I myself had doubts about it, and Thor plays scum well enough to create doubts in my mind.<br>\n<br>\nIt's your decision to lynch me, it's your responsbility to think about all the pieces in this game, beyond contradictions, beyond the mind games we play, beyond changing our tactics midway through something. I haven't done anything crazy scummy, Thor is pushing way too hard on me instead of scumhunting, I made a very direct claim, and it's time to move on. I will unequivocally represent a real and dangerous threat to scum, if left alive. If they don't lynch me now, it will be hard for them to do so later. Don't let them have this lynch.

Slandaar? Thor defends me and attacks Slandaar, so I chainsaw defend my partner in the early game? Instead of dividing ourselves to hedge our bets, with Thor that trusts me, and Slandaar who Thor distrusts. And in this situation, who do think would be the sacrifice? Me? And you think that I'll just announce to my partner we are going to take this wagon to the end, just to then completely derail the bandwagon? To seperate myself from Slandaar? No, it's too late to seperate myself from Slandaar. None of this is feasible. So why does Thor believes this? He's forgotten or misunderstood several important facts in this game. He doesn't read the thread a second time or bring up new analysis on previous patterns. He relies on simple messages like \"abr lied\". And he thinks thay I'm scum and Slandaar is scum.

Early wagon credit for IceNinja if he stays on my wagon.<br>\n<br>\nHell, even Thor could be my partner. His tactics for attacking me are extremely transparent. He's not making any effort in this game or thinking twice about lynching me. Does he really think that I would claim VT at L-2 as scum? For what? If you think I have a big ego, it must follow that you think that in my mind, I would have a massive impact on my team and that my team would be doomed without me. If that team is scum, it means that I would make a PR claim to stay alive. Not sacrifice myself. Not let my buddies bus me easily for town cred. Not questioning everyone and resisting so hard. That's what a team player does, right? Do I look like a team player to you? No, as scum, I feel like I'm even more responsible than my partners, because of my experience and my strategic way of doing things. I'd claim a PR and carry my team as far as I could until I was disproven. Or I'd at least take down a PR with me with a claim.

Albert then takes a stance in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5377519#p5377519\">206</a> saying that Slandaar's exchange with Thor isn't scummy. This comes after a lot of tunneling from Slandaar and Thor on each other. Albert puts up a case in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5377812#p5377812\">219</a> saying Thor is scummy. <br>\n<br>\nI feel that Albert's jump here was opportunistic. Thor had shown at least mild suspicion of Albert so it is not Albert who is initiating suspicion but rather reacting to Thor who was already suspicious of him. Add to that the fact that Thor was then completely busy attacking Slandaar and had his hands full. This shields Albert from immediate attacks from Thor since Thor was so busy trying to lynch someone else.<br>\n<br>\nElyse's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5387387#p5387387\">561</a> seals the deal for me. I find Albert's response to her post in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5388873#p5388873\">581</a> inadequate. It doesn't address the points raised and Albert tries to write it off as a disagreement. I also don't like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5388910#p5388910\">582</a> where he says \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">You lynch me, and say I turn up scum. Who do you lynch then?</div>\" That doesn't even make any sense. If he flips scum, good. We can work it out from there. Scum lynches trump lynching for information.<br>\n<br>\nAlbert's appeal to Slandaar in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5379204#p5379204\">254</a> and subsequent explanation is interesting. I'll quote it for reference:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5379220#p5379220\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5379220#p5379220\" data-post-id=\"5379220\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 257</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6983\">Albert B.

Albert knows that if a charismatic player dodges a lynch, it would be quite difficult to get the votes back on them again.

If Albert is scum, it will be difficult to get a wagon back on him later on (possibly with Thor dead and Albert's detractors mislynched or killed). Albert's now a strong scumread.

Is it possible that Thor is town and one of them killed F-16 to frame him?<br>\n<br>\nI realize this will probably bring a lot of suspicion on me to even suggest that, but I feel like everyone is too excited to lynch something that seems like a sure thing, and I want to holster our guns and realize that the people who were killed died for a reason. Who did Maxous suspect? Who else did F-16 suspect? Who else did Albert suspect?<br>\n<br>\nLet's not forget that we should give everyone else a chance to weigh in before potentially two more people die tonight.<br>\n<br>\nOne thing that struck me as odd was that Thor was trying to get people to kill IceNinja after he died. Why? Could it possibly because Thor knows that his scum faction didn't aim for Maxous, and that it might be another kill attempt that hit him? And he suspects IceNinja might be scum of another team?<br>\n<br>\nThese are all things I have to consider before I will even put my vote on Thor, who I feel should have been lynched yesterday and Albert was pretty obviously town (easy to say after the fact yes, but I was getting strong town vibes from him even before page 10 had elapsed).<br>\n<br>\nI was gone for most of Day 1, yes, but I will try to be active now that I am about halfway caught up.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, since somebody else is most likely going to die tonight, I would like to hear everyone's thoughts about their top town reads and scum reads. I think the scum in the game already has a pretty good idea of who they want to kill, because day 1 was pretty long and drawn out and everyone got pretty settled into their stances, so I don't think too much will be gained by scum if we are to share our thoughts. I feel the more we all share with the community, the better off we all will be. The more we hold things to ourselves, the less likely it is we will be able to catch mafia members efficiently, logically, and rationally.<br>\n<br>\nAnd the faster things go, the better it is for scum.

That will now be rather useless. At least he's netted us one scum with his sacrifice. I recommend we go back and read his posts to figure out who else he suspected. Finding out Maxous' suspicions are actually probably even more important, because we know for sure he was killed for some reason or another, and that's as good a reason to kill somebody as any else, I suppose.<br>\n<br>\nI have a strong town read on toolenduso. I know it didn't seem like that at first, and I certainly didn't help that out by sporadically posting prod dodges where I continually fingered him and Garmr as scum, but hey, after reading up, he's now sitting at the top of the stack after F-16's death. Why is he a strong town read, you ask? He has been asking good questions, seeming naive about things that I would expect town to seem naive about, doing his research; in stark contrast to ABR, who pretended to do research on Thor, toolenduso actually DID research on Thor and posted #265 which impressed me greatly. And even though I was being overly harsh on him at the beginning (mostly due to having nothing else to sink my teeth into), his first few posts were actually not that independently scummy and I feel like they are consistent with the rest of his behavior. It's vaguely possible that he is just playing us like a fiddle and has us completely hoodwinked, but I have more trust in my gut feelings than that. I will not lynch toolenduso and would recommend that nobody else lynch him either, should I die at any point.<br>\n<br>\nNext on my list is Garmr. Yes. I know what you're thinking. The two people I have had as mafia all game are now my top two town reads. Well, there it is. And it is what it is. So I'm not ashamed of it. The reasoning behind that one is less solid than toolenduso, and far less solid than F-16 was. I have him down as \"far too sloppy to be mafia\" and his posts definitely prove it. I don't feel like he is posting just to post, and I don't feel as if his posts have a scummy ulterior motive to them. They feel pretty genuine for the most part, and though he tries to be useful and isn't really, most of the time, at least he seems to be trying. I liked his commentary on ABR early on in the game where he compared ABR's play to other games. I also really liked the comment he made in #171: \"this might sound rich but I think there are scum on my wagon.\" That just really really doesn't feel to me like something that scum would think to say. It sounds hilariously town.<br>\n<br>\nIceNinja comes next (regardless of what I said about about Thor wanting him dead, which might mean Thor believes he is rival scum of some kind). He seems to think things through a little better than Garmr and generally comes across as pro-town, but there are less eureka moments when I read his posts. I really liked early on when he admitted that he'd vote for who the person he is voting was also voting. That didn't seem to come from a scum mindset because I don't think scum would admit something that sounded so inconsistent with a particular train of thought. I also liked #267, and especially #268. I don't want to lynch IceNinja for now.<br>\n<br>\nI have havingfitz and Elyse's player slots as rather more null. I have to read more of their (and their predecessor's) posts. I liked TCold's #63 about Sir Bastion, and Macros' #136 about Garmr though. Whether or not I agree with them is another thing entirely, but I liked the way those posts came across. They sounded genuine enough and/or made good points.<br>\n<br>\nSlandaar is sitting in a volatile spot for me. I can't really read him too well. I think his early attack on Thor could have been elaborate bussing, but we'll see how he acts when Thor is dead. If he starts finding other scum immediately I can't say I will hate that in the least. And if scum decides to kill him off, at least it will rid us of a pretty WIFOMy slot which has strong ties to Thor. I may get a better read on him after reading some of his later posts though. So stay tuned.<br>\n<br>\nI've got pretty much nothing on Axxle/Skelda. I have read more than half the game but I've only seen a few posts by Axxle, and though I liked his early post about Garmr, I have since come to disagree with the read I had on Garmr because of it, and I didn't feel particularly strongly one way or the other on any of the other posts I've read. This is another one of those reads you'll have to stay tuned on.<br>\n<br>\nMaxous wasn't very high on my list of town reads, so I'm glad he died. That saves me a lot of trouble. It's also going to be a gold mine going back through his posts and finding out what he thought about whom.<br>\n<br>\nThe last two players in the game are Sir Bastion and Thor. They are the only two players I had scum reads on, and they are (or were) both very strong scum reads. I wish F-16 hadn't (presumably) suicided on Thor last night, because he was a clear choice to lynch today anyway, what with how scummy he was Day 1, and also given ABR's final wishes. I guess it made sense to him to give town a little more security in their decision, and perhaps he thought Thor could wiggle his way out of it yet again, but either way I wish he wouldn't have done it, as he was my strongest town read while he was alive. So, Thor being scum is a foregone conclusion by this point, but that leaves Sir Bastion.<br>\n<br>\nI have a scum read on Sir Bastion for a number of reasons, most of which were early on in the game. He has since come back towards the middle of the scale somewhat, but I would still much rather lynch him than anyone else (except Thor) at this point. I am quite willing to be convinced that he is not scum, in fact, I have a note saying that if Thor is scum, he is less likely to be... not sure why I thought that, but it's in my notes under both Thor and Sir Bastion. Anyway, post 16 felt very contrived, post 26 was a soft-defend of Thor, 37 seemed to imply that he had nothing better to do than ignore certain people while waiting for others to post, 40 brings up how he was town in other games (as if to imply he is town here, or at least plant some kind of subconscious seed), and it also brings up something solely in order to be able to say \"buuut, I'm not going to talk about it here\" which is sketchy at best. he also spouts game theory in that post which seems unnecessary. I don't like in post 42 where he says \"assuming I don't?\" because that is a giant deflection. more unnecessary game theory in post 45. Jumping over to 112, he sticks with a vote on GuthrieGov while admitting his reasoning is shallow. He also questions GG in 113 to find out if GG thinks poorly of him. That's a weird thing for a townie to do. In post 168 he appears to have a good catch, but I don't like the way he talks about it as if it's only in passing, and seems detached, with his ellipses (...) and it feels like he's trying to point out awkward things about somebody in order to get others to latch onto them and do the dirty work of lynching them for him. Post 182 complains about having to slog through the Thor/Slandaar noisefest again, but it almost seems like he's not actually going to do it, he just wants people to think he is, so they'll think he's trying to be useful. Whether or not that's the case here, I don't like the attitude of trying to show off the things you're doing to help the game, and it feels off to me. I wrote under that point \"Let's see if he comes up with anything worthwhile or is just posturing\" and I don't have any notes after that which cancel out that sentiment. So clearly that's bad, and supports my idea that he never actually did re-read it, he just tried to snag some town credit for saying he was going to. 234 is a bunch of words with disproportionately little actual analysis of what was said, and it seemed to me like he was making a larger post in order to try to keep up the amount of posts he had at a competitive level with those who were posting the most in the game, solely for the sake of being seen as being active by other people.<br>\n<br>\nTo put it all into a few sentences (in case you weren't following along and looking at the posts, which you really should do), here's the case: He appears to be very aware and very concerned about what others think of him. He appears to be trying to plant thoughts into other people's subconscious to get them to feel certain ways about him and others, and that's not something town does. They are quite a bit more blunt about it. Kind of like I'm being right now, actually. And also, I just get a pretty good gut feeling that he's not one of the good guys, and that's always a nice cherry on top of the icing for me. So, logically speaking, we should lynch him after Thor.<br>\n<br>\nBut now, I want to read what everyone else thinks, and I'd like to finish reading the rest of the game before everyone else pummels Thor into the dust where he belongs. I want to be able to solidify my reads on certain people and develop reads on the people where I'm a little sparse on notes. Because I never feel very comfortable not having a stance on somebody. That makes me suspect them, and I don't like it when I suspect more people than can logically be scum in the game.<br>\n<br>\nI think that's pretty much it.

With 3 dead town, one very very probable scum, and several players I'm pretty sure aren't scum, the logical conclusion is you along with one of the two replacements.<br>\n<br>\nEach point individually is weak, therefore my case looks like a stretch, but as a whole I think you're a damn good bet for scum. I also admit a decent part of my scum read hinges on Thor being scum, so I'd like him lynched before you. But if he flips scum, we've got a lot of people who probably aren't scum. And you ain't one of them.</div></blockquote>\n\n<br>\n1. You missed the point entirely. I thought slandaar and thor were TVT at the time so tell me the town motivation for pushing either one of them? Also with the ABR case I said his my 2nd scum read Town players pressure their number 1 scum reads.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n2. That's pretty horrible as I said it all boils down to a players personality. Some people are really forgetful or don't even notice small things. In rl if someone forgot what a murder said in front of them as they killed someone does that mean they are lying and they are the actual murderer? This is why your point 2 Is horrible.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n3.  F-16 was pretty town but Maxous was way more Towny than him because of the person f 16 subbed (Guntheir) for plus f-16 is dead and confirmed town, Sir bastion in my eyes was town but as you can see from today he has had some suspicion on him so that rop him from the obvious town pool, Finally we get to you, Ice your the only one who actually thinks your obvious town no one else does Lol. Through the process of elimination the obvious town is maxous.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAlso you just admitted all the points are weak and from what I can tell a couple of weak points doesn't = a strong case.", "time": "Tue Oct 22, 2013 9:23 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=31972&start=775", "forum": "53", "thread": "31972"}

Though there is one seed of doubt which I will only touch on when we are actually waggoning him not before (something I am extending to only 2 players here).<br>\n<br>\nBut between you and him the difference is evidence, there is evidence that falcon intended to check you last night, there is evidence that he pegged his suspicion of ice to being ABR's partner.

Though I did need to check how quickly she jumped on the hider result. But 10 minutes after the day started (and 6 minutes after the pm) and a quick meta shows she is normally on at that time says to me that it was all a genuine response. You cant blame me for being suspect, Macros was someone on day 1 I had suspicions on.<br>\n<br>\nSlandaar does appear to be town, Despite being correct, I still dont agree with much of his day 1 work but with the exception of early day 1 I didnt find it scum motivated.

This in itself is not necessarily scummy. But it took him a while to do it.

I finished reading Thor (really scummy) and IceNinja (really town), and I'm now reading Garmr because Thor's post which I noted above made me want to check him out yet again. Here's where I'm at right now.<br>\n<br>\nThe Town Tier<br>\nzakk - Awesome and town.<br>\nICEninja - Strong town read. Thor's insistence that he be lynched made me stray into WIFOM land for a bit, but after a re-read of his ISO I can comfortably say he's town.<br>\ntoolenduso - Pretty strong town read as well. I feel like I'm getting to the point where I can throw him into the town bucket with IceNinja and stop worrying about him.<br>\n<br>\nThe Probably Town Tier<br>\nGarmr - Wafflied back and forth a little, but it's a pretty strong town read right now, as I'm reading his ISO. It comes to me also that the only reason I doubted this was because of Thor. So, there's that. I'm going to finish his ISO and if it changes I'll post something, but I don't think it will. For now he stays out of the Town tier and is in the Probably Town tier of my opinions.<br>\n<br>\nThe Seems Unlikely to Be Aligned With Pretty Obvious Scum Tier<br>\nSlandaar - I really don't think he's scum, if Thor is. And I think Thor is. If they are scum together though, they deserve to win just for the amount of baloney they put us through on Day 1. That amount of back and forth would be really hard to contrive on the fly with so many other factors (players) floating around and through the middle of it all. I still want to read Slandaar's posts for motivational tells though.<br>\n<br>\nThe Relatively Nothing Tier (Where Probably Resides At Least One Scum If Not Two)<br>\nTCold/havingfitz - Still need to read more of this slot. I have limited notes on TCold, and nothing on havingfitz.<br>\nMacros/Elyse - I had a vague opinion that Macros was townish, but I need to read much more deeply into that. Also, I have read nothing of Elyse.<br>\nAxxle/Skelda - Same as above, except exchange Macros for Axxle, and Elyse for Skelda.<br>\n<br>\nThe I Have Seen A Lot of Reasons To Think They're Scum Tier<br>\nSir Bastion<br>\n<br>\nThe Pretty Obvious Scum Tier<br>\nThor665 - Scum.

Ice and Thor could very well have been coordinating with ice the push back and forth. But at the same time, they would have known the second thor flipped the jig was up on them having daychat so any such plans would be dangerously flawed.<br>\n<br>\nAs for Fitz, if he had found a town pr I would expect he would have breadcrumbed it by at least giving a reads list and putting the player high in town reads. He gave no such reads list so my guess is whoever he looked at on night 1 returned as a vanilla which is worthless.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nVery quickly I havnt found a daychat one yet, but from a few of Thor's games as scum in newbie games we get the following:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>scumthor wrote:</cite>I never 'plan' Day 1 as scum - I prefer to let it flow as it flows and see where it takes me.<br>\nHere's my default scum IC info speech;<br>\n<br>\nWelcome to being dastardly scum, it is our job to kill the living bejeezus out of the town. I have a couple pieces of quick advice for you as newbie scum. Feel free to take what I say and mull it over with your own thoughts. I won't claim these are absolute rules of awesome, but I will say they appear to work pretty well in my opinion.<br>\n<br>\n1. Try to post at least once a day. I know some people advocate lurking as a good scum tactic, I think it is a poor plan overall. Usually people who post consistently are less likely to be lynched than those that don't.<br>\n<br>\n2. When you are attacked, do a controlled attack back. Now, you're almost assuredly going to be attacked at some point this game, and Day 1 is a likely time for it to happen. When you are attacked, don't ignore the attack, at the same time, don't pay attention only to the attack. The best way to respond to an attack is to address it...but then also, in the same post, make a continued press/question/attack on another player; here's an example;<br>\n<br>\nBad Idea<br>\nPlayer 1: U R Scumz!<br>\nYou: No I'm not, U R Scumz!<br>\nPlayer 1: See how guilty he sounds? Vote pl0x!<br>\n<br>\nAnother Bad Idea<br>\nPlayer 1: U R Scumz!<br>\nYou: No I'm not, you have no evidence. By the way, don't you agree that Player 2 is scumz?<br>\nPlayer 1: He's trying to deflect me onto Player 2, he is scumz! Lynch Woody na0w!<br>\n<br>\nGood Idea<br>\nPlayer 1: U R Scumz!<br>\nYou: No I'm not, let me see your case and I'll take it apart, it's silly to think I'm scum.<br>\n<br>\nOh, yeah, Player 2, earlier when you voted for Player 3 you never said why, what's up with that? Why do you think Player 3 is scum? What did you hope to gain by voting him without explaining why? Answer in your next post!<br>\n<br>\n--------------<br>\n<br>\nMake sense?<br>\n<br>\n3. Forget you're scum. This is my gold standard advice. Here's my super scum strategy secret - TOWN GENERALLY HAS NO IDEA WHAT IT'S DOING AND MOST \"SCUMTELLS\" ARE MADE UP BALONEY. Don't \"try\" to get someone mislynched. DOn't do sudden vote switches just to get someone who is town mislynched. What you should do is honestly approach the game as though you were town, and vote people for the reasons you'd normally vote people. Make cases. Ask questions. Develop town reads and react to them like they're town. Develop scum reads and try to get those players lynched. Adjust your reads when new evidence shows up. If you do that all I pretty much promise you that unless a PR catches you that you'll make it to endgame.<br>\n<br>\n4. Don't get tense if I attack you, I probably will - feel free to attack me if I look scummy, in fact I encourage it. But also feel free to blatantly buddy me if you think I look town. Keep an honest interaction with your partner (in a perfect world, forget that I'm your partner and react to me as honestly as possible).<br>\n<br>\n5. If it looks like you're about to be lynched, it is not a bad idea to claim a PR - at least there's a chance you'll sucker out a real one,a nd if not then...hey, you may not be lynched. If you want to fakeclaim a PR it is best to decide which one you intend to do, and remember to PLAY LIKE THAT PR the whole game. Make decisions each night as to what your town PR night actions are - and allow your gameplay to *change* depending on the results you get. For instance - if you plan to claim cop, and decide you'd protect 'Player X' and there is no night kill that night - then prepare to treat 'Player X' like likely town for the rest of the game - and react a little cageishly if people ask you why. Stuff like that.<br>\n<br>\n6. Have fun.

Therefore I believe that either only Thor was allowed to post and the other read or Thor was able to have a one-on-one with one but not all scum. Otherwise they would just have daytalk powers and the name \"encrypter\" would not have been neccesary. I believe scum's daytalk abilities died with thor</div>) I think Slandaar is a very likely scum buddy for Thor.<br>\n<br>\nThink about it. How many players told Slandaar to STFU and he never listened? Even Thor himself had an awkward response in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5385508#p5385508\" class=\"postlink\">post 462</a> that really made me make a weird face though I didn't understand at the time.

It was the perfect distancing scheme.<br>\n<br>\nHow many of you would, as town, do what Slandaar did d1 with such a stupidly weak case? Both Slandaar and Thor damn well knew Thor wasn't going to be lynched d1.<br>\n<br>\nI also suspect that there's a decent change Garmr was taking ques from Thor during d1 to push zakk while still lending support to the ABRwagon, and eventually throwing in his vote. I made a whole case on it during the weekend in a word doc, but one particular post from Garmr kind of throws a loop through the whole idea.<br>\n<br>\nA quick look at vote counts shows Skelda as the most likely partner to Thor, and based literally just on the D1 lynch zakk is the only other possibility if neither Skelda nor Slandaar is scum.<br>\n<br>\nSlandaar is the best bet here. For reasons stated earlier I think zakk is probtown, and while I feel like I have a decent case on Garmr, the one issue I have with that would cause me to hesitate to lynch him today.

It is quite similar to what I was planning on posting, minus the fact that I would word \"appeal to authority\" as using sheer force of will/personality to accomplish a goal instead of using logic, which has been a trend sch as his \"defense\" against my original attack on him. While I know this simply is something Albert does, the fact that he has no good scum leads at the moment (or all day really) and has been using this force anyway to direct town seems to play a lot more to a scum win condition than town.</div></blockquote>\nWAHHHHHHHHHHHHH LEAVE THOR ALONE!!!\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5385434#p5385434\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5385434#p5385434\" data-post-id=\"5385434\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 455</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12670\">ICEninja</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Slandaar wrote:</cite>\nWell show me this misrep I assume you know what it is Ice.\n</div></blockquote>\nThe existence or non existence of any misrep that may or may not have happened has <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">zero</div> implications of my read on you.

He has since come back towards the middle of the scale somewhat, but I would still much rather lynch him than anyone else (except Thor) at this point. I am quite willing to be convinced that he is not scum, in fact, I have a note saying that if Thor is scum, he is less likely to be... not sure why I thought that, but it's in my notes under both Thor and Sir Bastion. Anyway, post 16 felt very contrived, post 26 was a soft-defend of Thor, 37 seemed to imply that he had nothing better to do than ignore certain people while waiting for others to post, 40 brings up how he was town in other games (as if to imply he is town here, or at least plant some kind of subconscious seed), and it also brings up something solely in order to be able to say \"buuut, I'm not going to talk about it here\" which is sketchy at best. he also spouts game theory in that post which seems unnecessary. I don't like in post 42 where he says \"assuming I don't?\" because that is a giant deflection. more unnecessary game theory in post 45. Jumping over to 112, he sticks with a vote on GuthrieGov while admitting his reasoning is shallow. He also questions GG in 113 to find out if GG thinks poorly of him. That's a weird thing for a townie to do. In post 168 he appears to have a good catch, but I don't like the way he talks about it as if it's only in passing, and seems detached, with his ellipses (...) and it feels like he's trying to point out awkward things about somebody in order to get others to latch onto them and do the dirty work of lynching them for him. Post 182 complains about having to slog through the Thor/Slandaar noisefest again, but it almost seems like he's not actually going to do it, he just wants people to think he is, so they'll think he's trying to be useful. Whether or not that's the case here, I don't like the attitude of trying to show off the things you're doing to help the game, and it feels off to me. I wrote under that point \"Let's see if he comes up with anything worthwhile or is just posturing\" and I don't have any notes after that which cancel out that sentiment. So clearly that's bad, and supports my idea that he never actually did re-read it, he just tried to snag some town credit for saying he was going to. 234 is a bunch of words with disproportionately little actual analysis of what was said, and it seemed to me like he was making a larger post in order to try to keep up the amount of posts he had at a competitive level with those who were posting the most in the game, solely for the sake of being seen as being active by other people.<br>\n<br>\nTo put it all into a few sentences (in case you weren't following along and looking at the posts, which you really should do), here's the case: He appears to be very aware and very concerned about what others think of him. He appears to be trying to plant thoughts into other people's subconscious to get them to feel certain ways about him and others, and that's not something town does. They are quite a bit more blunt about it. Kind of like I'm being right now, actually. And also, I just get a pretty good gut feeling that he's not one of the good guys, and that's always a nice cherry on top of the icing for me.

Nobody wants to read that baloney.<br>\n<br>\nThird, your points are coming across as oddly self-serving.<br>\n<br>\nIt's almost like you can't wait to just lynch one guy and move on to the next, stopping only to loot the corpse for as much town cred as you can possibly squeeze out of it. That's an attitude I see more as coming from bussing scum than earnest town. Town seems to want to deliberate more. Heck, I want to deliberate for as long as possible now that I know that the mafia don't have day talk abilities any longer.<br>\n<br>\nI mean, Sir Bastion makes a good point in his post #929; everyone is more or less back on the board, suspicion-wise.<br>\n<br>\nFor all we know, we have weak scum like Garmr who, though he screwed up at first, Thor realized he'd have to carry Garmr on his back and teach him how to play the newb card and manipulate people in ways that Thor can't seem to do because he's relatively more well known around the site. Taking this example to the extreme, it's entirely possible that Thor was even writing full posts for Garmr, sending them to him, and just having Garmr copy-paste them into his next forum post. That kind of anonymity would allow Thor to deliberately craft someone else's image without the responsibility of living up to certain expectations. That would be a pretty large advantage.<br>\n<br>\nSecondly, it's entirely possible with the day talk ability that the mafia pulled some kind of sophisticated distancing act on Day 1 between two members that would help cement the two as different alignments in everyone's mind. Such an argument could be carefully controlled and coordinated back and forth on both the front end and on the back side and they could push and pull as necessary and pretend to try to get each other lynched. All the while, they would be looking for a scapegoat, someone else to take the blame. And until they found that scapegoat, they would continue to throw digs at each other and have ridiculous amounts of confirmation bias (sound familiar?) in their posts, arguing over such small details that nobody else could follow the argument, or quickly lost the desire to after such wanton repetition, and all of this relentlessly continuing far past the point of reason, such that everyone would write off the entire situation as townies infighting and therefore chalk it up to something that's better off left ignored because there is little to be gained. Because I know that's what I would do. Of course you realize by this point that I'm talking about you and Thor, during Day 1.<br>\n<br>\nI mean, Slandaar, throw me a bone here.

Sometimes you actually come across like you're philosophically opposed to laying out your reasoning or something. It takes persistent questioning to get you to explain what you mean.

I was pretty confident in zakk being town earlier, but his actions since then have made me think twice. So now I'm left weighing which of his actions are less likely for him to do as town and which are less likely for him to do as scum.<br>\n<br>\nAt any rate, the reason I said Garmr and Skelda were the scumteam before is because Elyse is the most obvious town in my eyes and zakk gave me something that seemed very towny (zakk's pushing for me to be clear/obvtown today.)<br>\n<br>\nEven with zakk as an option for scum, though, it still looks like Garmr is scum either way. Because Skelda also has a towny action (his \"townslip,\" which the now-confirmed-town Slandaar pointed out earlier in the game). So to me, it looks like the team is either Garmr/zakk or Garmr/Skelda.<br>\n<br>\nBut since the two most active players right now seem unwilling to lynch Garmr, I'll have to do a bit more digging before I know who to go for.<br>\n<br>\nI guess the obvious choice would be Skelda, since both zakk and Elyse have suggested that they would be open to a Skelda lynch, but I'd still like to look into it a bit more.<br>\n<br>\nA Skelda claim would make this easier.", "time": "Sun Nov 10, 2013 5:18 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=31972&start=1200", "forum": "53", "thread": "31972"}
