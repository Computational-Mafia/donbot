If Slandaar is your biggest suspect why is your vote not on him?  This going for anything for a bandwagon is a bad disease, several players seem to have it and it bugs me.

It's like getting blood from a stone to get thoughts from most of you.<br><br>I completely disagree with Slandaars case against thor and I am mixed on the Albert's case against Thor. I was initially going to discard Albert's case that Thor was acting out of form for his townplay as my brief experiences playing with him had him down as one of those force of nature players who played every game the same way, sticking close to his namesake head butting everybody norse style. (I think I've only had one game with him, but he might have been in another game with me that was lost in the great tiger crash of 2012) <br><br>But I quick recap of that game does show some truth to Albert's comment that town Thor does not appear to normally make calls to lynch. But the game I played him with was a unique circumstance. So I will review the three games Thor provided.<br><br>I am somewhat settled by Slandaars responses, I would not consider him town yet and I still do feel he is putting far too much blame on thor for the battle of the walls which I still disagree with him on.<br><br>other major suspicions I have is Axxle, Macros and Guthrie. Sadly the lurking/absence of Axxle has stalled any development on him and guthrie has gone and done the same. Macros I feel looked very bad for his actions involved the Garmr wagon. I dont see why a town player needed to be pushed to make his vote and I find the whine post he followed it up with to be very suspicous.<br><br>I guess outside them most people fall into the null catagory, the closest I have to people I would be comfortable in saying they are playing like town is only Iceninja. I dont think there is much of case for Garmr to be scum, but he hasnt reassured me as a competent player and toolenduso appears well meaning but neutral. He does confirm with Thor that Slandaar misrepped him, but he doesnt act on it, instead keeping his vote on albert. Which is curious.<br><br>Frankly if the mod has more posts then you then you then you are failing in participating as a town player so there are five players in this game that are being useless and need to get their acts together."}

When I say always happens its happened 2/2 where we were both town, this is why the case is so strong because of the timing in the meta between us.

I am always aggressive (this is the meta part) therefore the playstyle aspects of what I did are not really telling...and at that point I'm not sure what the case is (there's a reason ABR is refusing to even discuss that other than to just keep screaming it's 'different' somehow...yeah)<br><br>2. The only way I was uninterested in conversation (an ironic tell being leveled at someone that has been asked to stop posting so much) is if people believe I literally expect all conversation to end because I ask it to...I mean, seriously. That's like me saying 'Go die now' and then to be accussed of wanting that person to literally, in the real world, die. I'm frankly in a mix of bemusement and frustration that this is even part of a case. Also, again, this is a meta aspect insomuch as I *often* say things like that, so therefore ieven if all of you think it is something only scum would say (which I can't argue about other than to suggest you're all insane) it is not something I only say as scum, nor is it something I think scum are benefited by saying. Ergo - still not a good tell.<br><br>3. I also asked *you* specifically if there was ANYTHING you felt I hadn't addressed.<br><br>Apparently it is \"well, you addressed your case but not in the way I wanted you to...\"<br><br>Um...whu?<br>Seriously, it's a playstyle tell, if I don't go into my meta then my defense to the case becomes as silly as the case you are all buying into.<br>AGGRESSIVE PLAYERS ARE NOT ALWAYS SCUM, BUT CAN BE AGGRESSIVE TOWN, AND SOME PLAYERS, AS TOWN OR SCUM, LIKE TO PRESS WAGONS IN A WAY THAT EXPRESSES DESIRE OF INSTANT LYNCH IN ORDER TO ADD REAL PRESSURE TO THE PLAYERS THEY ARE VOTING - AND I BELIEVE IN HIS PLAYSTYLE MORE THAN THE PLAYSTYLE WHEREIN BEING AGGRESSIVE IS SCUMMY, AND SAYING 'SPEEDLYNCH' AUTOMATICALLY MEANS A SPEEDLYNCH HAPPENS.<br><br>There.<br>That's about as much as one can do without going into meta and it's *still* touching on meta insomuch as it's discussing playstyle.<br>But that's because the case against me is a ephemeral meta based concept.<br>I can't even describe nor think of what serious points have been raised against me that I can address - can you tell me what they are? I'll do it.<br>Until then I am annoyed you're leveling another smurfy derp mud slap at me and acting like you're doing anything. Seriously, what am I even supposed to say to a complaint like that?<br>I also used meta when addressing your case on ABR and that had nothing to do with me or a case on me.<br>Shock.<br>Maybe I use meta more than you, it's probably a scumtell because Thor thinks meta is relevant and should be discussed, especially about cases based on meta."}

I skimmed through this game but will re-read in more Detail tonight. <br><br>I am unsure about the debate between Albert and Thor. I have read one game of Albert's (the one linked on the \"<a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=A_Beautiful_Guide_to_Focusing_on_Scum_and_Getting_them_Lynched\" class=\"postlink\">A beautiful guide to focussing on scum and getting them lynched</a>.\" wiki article. My thoughts were that Albert's pushes in that game were a lot more forceful and pushy as opposed to his push on Thor here where I get a more laid-back feeling. It could be circumstantial considering the impending deadline in the other game. I'll double check with other games to see if there is a common pattern. I've played two games with Thor but haven't picked up on any meta-tells that were useful. I'll read the posted games to verify whether Albert's case is accurate.<br><br>I think IceNinja is likely scum. A lot of his earlier posts gave me a bad gut feeling. I don't like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5366864#p5366864\">326 </a>or <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5366864#p5366864\">331 </a>. I find meta to be a very useful tool and IceNinja's dismissal of Thor's case based on the fact that he is referring to his meta to be a poor argument. 331 where he essentially says \"fair enough, carry on\" is terrible. Also he wants to do a VCA but declines to put his vote down? <br><br>I think VCA's are useless but IceNinja clearly thinks that they are useful. With a player who has that mindset, I'd expect him to put down a vote so it becomes easier to VCA him. He is working against what he seems to think is a useful scumhunting method."}

I start showcasing just how bad his case is and making a point about how terrible it is so that even the player base here is likely to notice.<br>5. As a defensive move, Al *admits* he's lying about the bad case to...show me a lesson...? Of...either relaxing and not pushing bad cases if town...or being scared if I'm scum...or...I dunno. You may insert your own understanding, the point is he admitted it was a lie, as I'd already shown.<br>6. He then leaps away to vote elsewhere, acting like it's all said and done with me.<br><br>The answer is, it isn't. He is scum, he pushed a bad case, he got caught, and now he's in hard defense. You don't push a case of lies on someone, act like it's legit, and then back off *after* they show how it isn't legit and try to pretend it was some oddball scumhunting concept. No, he's trying to be brassy enough to pass it off as 'too scummy to be scum' and I'm not buying. That's why he doesn't get to do his scummy back off, and if you're weirded out by me calling him on how terrible that back off is, then I don't know what else to say to you - since apparently you found his play fine.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5384764#p5384764\" class=\"postlink\">post 397</a>, Maxous wrote:</cite>If there's one thing I remember about Slandaar, it's that he does this anyway.</div></blockquote><br>This I concur with."}

It's not like a speedlynch would actually happen. It's just something to emphasize his read on the player.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Slandaar's reach on tool</span><br>Slandaar's original case on tool was a really big stretch and Slandaar usually makes big openings. This game I was disappointed and found his initial push bad, which is unlike him. In the whole Thor-Slandaar-Albert debate, I think there's at least one scum, and I was thinking it was Slandaar until recently. I'll talk more about that later.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Axxle using the word barometer</span><br>This is probably dumb but I found it odd that after Thor used the word barometer to gauge newbiness, Axxle also used it. I don't know if he's subtly aligning his play to Thor or it was just a word in his mind.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Garmr's \"you guys want more fine\"</span><br>I really didn't like this at all. You should always have your reads out on the table. When something asks you for more and you go \"ugh fine\" and churn out some content, it's scummy.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Garmr 173 scumslip</span><br>Looking back this isn't as bad as I thought it was.

Ice has literally the exact opposite feelings. I found it weird that TCold didn't address Ice at all there.<br><br>As far as the Albert-Thor-Slandaar trifecta battle royale, I thought Slandaar was scum for his weak reasoning but Albert's \"lol jk the case on you is fake. You should be scared of me though\" bugs me the wrong way. It's like he realized he was wrong and came up with that after the fact. I also dislike his subsequent insistence that Thor is scummy for overreacting in his response? If he didn't jump on it, it would be scummy, so it's kind of a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't situation. Also, I think it was Sir Bastion who pointed out how Albert didn't question those who followed his fake case on Thor.

On its own it merits nothing, any sensible player town or scum would have dropped the issue temporarily for a point later on where it can be attached to a more effective case. Right now though he is making thor look better by his own actions alone. So if Thor is scum Slandaar is in fact helping him. Regardless of how much he whines.<br><br>I've already made my post (ages ago) on the misrep issue. Do I think Slandaar misrep? yes, but I dont think it was intentional, tool's *conclusion* was buried in a block of text and can be easily missed (just as much as I can miss a half line/half arsed justification from slandaar on why he thinks your town) that happens. If Thor had still been voting Slandaar and pushing to lynch him today based on the misrep over the last 2 pages then slandaar has a case for scummy behaviour. But he hasnt, the game has moved on. It looks worse for him to be clamping on to this point now when so much more important things are going on.<br><br><br>Garmr you are being an idiot on numerous levels right now."}

It makes no sense for me to go after him as scum. It would be extremely non-strategic of me.<br><br>Elyse, work with me here. Don't throw away the lynch because you don't trust me. Re-evaluate. If you're town, you're going to have a harder time in this game with a Day 1 lynch on me with no counterwagon whatsoever, just like IceNinja says. You won't get much information. I'm gong to flip vanilla townie. <br><br>You can proceed to wrongly blame me as Sir Bastion, saying I made \"mistakes\". No, I made no mistakes. I'm uncertain about who is scum. That's not a mistake, it's a real challenge. I can't say who is scum for certain, but out of everyone, Thor is playing the most black and white, and therefore I think he's the scum. He started as a gut read, back when I thought he was defending me with meta. I chose that time to go against him. I derailed the wagon on him because of my own doubts. Not because \"I was going to get caught\". If I stayed on Thor, it would be in the same shoes as Slandaar right now, exchanging wall posts with Thor, each arguing our points without ever agreeing. There was a chance he was going to get lynched as well, which I wasn't prepared  to take responsibility for. The reason why I asked Slandaar if he was certain about Thor, that he would not unvote once Thor gained a bigger bandwagon, was because I myself had doubts about it, and Thor plays scum well enough to create doubts in my mind.<br><br>It's your decision to lynch me, it's your responsbility to think about all the pieces in this game, beyond contradictions, beyond the mind games we play, beyond changing our tactics midway through something. I haven't done anything crazy scummy, Thor is pushing way too hard on me instead of scumhunting, I made a very direct claim, and it's time to move on. I will unequivocally represent a real and dangerous threat to scum, if left alive. If they don't lynch me now, it will be hard for them to do so later. Don't let them have this lynch. And if you do, don't you dare come blaming me later. This is on you."}

And you think that I'll just announce to my partner we are going to take this wagon to the end, just to then completely derail the bandwagon? To seperate myself from Slandaar? No, it's too late to seperate myself from Slandaar. None of this is feasible. So why does Thor believes this? He's forgotten or misunderstood several important facts in this game. He doesn't read the thread a second time or bring up new analysis on previous patterns. He relies on simple messages like \"abr lied\". And he thinks thay I'm scum and Slandaar is scum.

That's what a team player does, right? Do I look like a team player to you? No, as scum, I feel like I'm even more responsible than my partners, because of my experience and my strategic way of doing things.

It's not his style to OMGUS. He didn't even take it personally when I pushed him around. All he's doing, is acting strategic. So if it's not OMGUS, why is he trying so hard to lynch me and Slandaar?

He presents his thoughts to us in a very linear way that benefits his long-term survival, that's it, that's all."}

If Albert is scum, it will be difficult to get a wagon back on him later on (possibly with Thor dead and Albert's detractors mislynched or killed). Albert's now a strong scumread.

That will now be rather useless. At least he's netted us one scum with his sacrifice. I recommend we go back and read his posts to figure out who else he suspected. Finding out Maxous' suspicions are actually probably even more important, because we know for sure he was killed for some reason or another, and that's as good a reason to kill somebody as any else, I suppose.<br><br>I have a strong town read on toolenduso. I know it didn't seem like that at first, and I certainly didn't help that out by sporadically posting prod dodges where I continually fingered him and Garmr as scum, but hey, after reading up, he's now sitting at the top of the stack after F-16's death. Why is he a strong town read, you ask? He has been asking good questions, seeming naive about things that I would expect town to seem naive about, doing his research; in stark contrast to ABR, who pretended to do research on Thor, toolenduso actually DID research on Thor and posted #265 which impressed me greatly. And even though I was being overly harsh on him at the beginning (mostly due to having nothing else to sink my teeth into), his first few posts were actually not that independently scummy and I feel like they are consistent with the rest of his behavior. It's vaguely possible that he is just playing us like a fiddle and has us completely hoodwinked, but I have more trust in my gut feelings than that. I will not lynch toolenduso and would recommend that nobody else lynch him either, should I die at any point.<br><br>Next on my list is Garmr. Yes. I know what you're thinking. The two people I have had as mafia all game are now my top two town reads. Well, there it is. And it is what it is. So I'm not ashamed of it. The reasoning behind that one is less solid than toolenduso, and far less solid than F-16 was. I have him down as \"far too sloppy to be mafia\" and his posts definitely prove it. I don't feel like he is posting just to post, and I don't feel as if his posts have a scummy ulterior motive to them. They feel pretty genuine for the most part, and though he tries to be useful and isn't really, most of the time, at least he seems to be trying. I liked his commentary on ABR early on in the game where he compared ABR's play to other games. I also really liked the comment he made in #171: \"this might sound rich but I think there are scum on my wagon.\" That just really really doesn't feel to me like something that scum would think to say. It sounds hilariously town.<br><br>IceNinja comes next (regardless of what I said about about Thor wanting him dead, which might mean Thor believes he is rival scum of some kind). He seems to think things through a little better than Garmr and generally comes across as pro-town, but there are less eureka moments when I read his posts. I really liked early on when he admitted that he'd vote for who the person he is voting was also voting. That didn't seem to come from a scum mindset because I don't think scum would admit something that sounded so inconsistent with a particular train of thought. I also liked #267, and especially #268. I don't want to lynch IceNinja for now.<br><br>I have havingfitz and Elyse's player slots as rather more null. I have to read more of their (and their predecessor's) posts. I liked TCold's #63 about Sir Bastion, and Macros' #136 about Garmr though. Whether or not I agree with them is another thing entirely, but I liked the way those posts came across. They sounded genuine enough and/or made good points.<br><br>Slandaar is sitting in a volatile spot for me. I can't really read him too well. I think his early attack on Thor could have been elaborate bussing, but we'll see how he acts when Thor is dead. If he starts finding other scum immediately I can't say I will hate that in the least. And if scum decides to kill him off, at least it will rid us of a pretty WIFOMy slot which has strong ties to Thor. I may get a better read on him after reading some of his later posts though. So stay tuned.<br><br>I've got pretty much nothing on Axxle/Skelda. I have read more than half the game but I've only seen a few posts by Axxle, and though I liked his early post about Garmr, I have since come to disagree with the read I had on Garmr because of it, and I didn't feel particularly strongly one way or the other on any of the other posts I've read. This is another one of those reads you'll have to stay tuned on.<br><br>Maxous wasn't very high on my list of town reads, so I'm glad he died. That saves me a lot of trouble. It's also going to be a gold mine going back through his posts and finding out what he thought about whom.<br><br>The last two players in the game are Sir Bastion and Thor. They are the only two players I had scum reads on, and they are (or were) both very strong scum reads. I wish F-16 hadn't (presumably) suicided on Thor last night, because he was a clear choice to lynch today anyway, what with how scummy he was Day 1, and also given ABR's final wishes. I guess it made sense to him to give town a little more security in their decision, and perhaps he thought Thor could wiggle his way out of it yet again, but either way I wish he wouldn't have done it, as he was my strongest town read while he was alive. So, Thor being scum is a foregone conclusion by this point, but that leaves Sir Bastion.<br><br>I have a scum read on Sir Bastion for a number of reasons, most of which were early on in the game. He has since come back towards the middle of the scale somewhat, but I would still much rather lynch him than anyone else (except Thor) at this point. I am quite willing to be convinced that he is not scum, in fact, I have a note saying that if Thor is scum, he is less likely to be... not sure why I thought that, but it's in my notes under both Thor and Sir Bastion. Anyway, post 16 felt very contrived, post 26 was a soft-defend of Thor, 37 seemed to imply that he had nothing better to do than ignore certain people while waiting for others to post, 40 brings up how he was town in other games (as if to imply he is town here, or at least plant some kind of subconscious seed), and it also brings up something solely in order to be able to say \"buuut, I'm not going to talk about it here\" which is sketchy at best. he also spouts game theory in that post which seems unnecessary. I don't like in post 42 where he says \"assuming I don't?\" because that is a giant deflection. more unnecessary game theory in post 45. Jumping over to 112, he sticks with a vote on GuthrieGov while admitting his reasoning is shallow. He also questions GG in 113 to find out if GG thinks poorly of him. That's a weird thing for a townie to do. In post 168 he appears to have a good catch, but I don't like the way he talks about it as if it's only in passing, and seems detached, with his ellipses (...) and it feels like he's trying to point out awkward things about somebody in order to get others to latch onto them and do the dirty work of lynching them for him. Post 182 complains about having to slog through the Thor/Slandaar noisefest again, but it almost seems like he's not actually going to do it, he just wants people to think he is, so they'll think he's trying to be useful. Whether or not that's the case here, I don't like the attitude of trying to show off the things you're doing to help the game, and it feels off to me. I wrote under that point \"Let's see if he comes up with anything worthwhile or is just posturing\" and I don't have any notes after that which cancel out that sentiment. So clearly that's bad, and supports my idea that he never actually did re-read it, he just tried to snag some town credit for saying he was going to. 234 is a bunch of words with disproportionately little actual analysis of what was said, and it seemed to me like he was making a larger post in order to try to keep up the amount of posts he had at a competitive level with those who were posting the most in the game, solely for the sake of being seen as being active by other people.<br><br>To put it all into a few sentences (in case you weren't following along and looking at the posts, which you really should do), here's the case: He appears to be very aware and very concerned about what others think of him. He appears to be trying to plant thoughts into other people's subconscious to get them to feel certain ways about him and others, and that's not something town does. They are quite a bit more blunt about it. Kind of like I'm being right now, actually. And also, I just get a pretty good gut feeling that he's not one of the good guys, and that's always a nice cherry on top of the icing for me. So, logically speaking, we should lynch him after Thor.<br><br>But now, I want to read what everyone else thinks, and I'd like to finish reading the rest of the game before everyone else pummels Thor into the dust where he belongs. I want to be able to solidify my reads on certain people and develop reads on the people where I'm a little sparse on notes. Because I never feel very comfortable not having a stance on somebody. That makes me suspect them, and I don't like it when I suspect more people than can logically be scum in the game.<br><br>I think that's pretty much it. Hope this post was useful to you."}

F-16 was pretty town but Maxous was way more Towny than him because of the person f 16 subbed (Guntheir) for plus f-16 is dead and confirmed town, Sir bastion in my eyes was town but as you can see from today he has had some suspicion on him so that rop him from the obvious town pool, Finally we get to you, Ice your the only one who actually thinks your obvious town no one else does Lol.

You cant blame me for being suspect, Macros was someone on day 1 I had suspicions on.<br><br>Slandaar does appear to be town, Despite being correct, I still dont agree with much of his day 1 work but with the exception of early day 1 I didnt find it scum motivated.

This in itself is not necessarily scummy. But it took him a while to do it. He declared his intention to vote for Albert after being accused of not commenting on the situation (although he had, a little). But he said he wanted to \"milk day 1\" for what it was worth.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5394882#p5394882\" class=\"postlink\">post 691</a>, Garmr wrote:</cite>I'm on everyday and I already declared my intention to vote ABR latter. The reason I don't do it now is because I'm milking what I can out of the day. So his at a imaginary L-1 now.</div></blockquote><br>Personally, I thought that sentiment was fine. The ABR wagon was confirmed to succeed at that point. But then Thor challenged it in this post:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5395258#p5395258\" class=\"postlink\">post 694</a>, Thor665 wrote:</cite>So, just to work out this outline;<br><br>1. You are here everyday.<br>2. You have no questions or issues to present.<br>3. You want us to \"milk\" the remaining time because...you want to spend the time...not voting...so that time passes...</div></blockquote><br>...which didn't really say anything at all. I mean, what was Thor's challenge to Garmr wanting to wait? Essentially what Thor was saying in the post was \"I don't understand why you want to wait to vote for ABR.\"<br>Garmr responded with this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5395604#p5395604\" class=\"postlink\">post 699</a>, Garmr wrote:</cite>I never thought of it that way.... I usually just stretch the day as long as I can then something unexpected happens out of no where that changes the game. I am guessing this doesn't happen every game by your tone?</div></blockquote><br>...basically caving to nothing.<br>Then in this post...<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5404170#p5404170\" class=\"postlink\">post 790</a>, Garmr wrote:</cite>Slandaar while I do agree with your case shouldn't we wait till the other players place say something. We have to get a response from TCold and havingfitz now.

He is pressed to comment on the ABR situation, giving him an excuse to hop on a bandwagon against town.<br>2. To avoid looking too eager, he posts a couple of times making a case for Albert, then says he is going to vote for him. He uses the \"milking day 1\" thing to avoid seeming eager as well.<br>3. He takes a cue from his more-experienced scumbuddy, Thor, to jump on in.<br>4. Having been given a reason to and having established a case, he does so.<br> <br>Thoughts?"}

I finished reading Thor (really scummy) and IceNinja (really town), and I'm now reading Garmr because Thor's post which I noted above made me want to check him out yet again. Here's where I'm at right now.<br><br>The Town Tier<br>zakk - Awesome and town.<br>ICEninja - Strong town read. Thor's insistence that he be lynched made me stray into WIFOM land for a bit, but after a re-read of his ISO I can comfortably say he's town.<br>toolenduso - Pretty strong town read as well. I feel like I'm getting to the point where I can throw him into the town bucket with IceNinja and stop worrying about him.<br><br>The Probably Town Tier<br>Garmr - Wafflied back and forth a little, but it's a pretty strong town read right now, as I'm reading his ISO. It comes to me also that the only reason I doubted this was because of Thor. So, there's that. I'm going to finish his ISO and if it changes I'll post something, but I don't think it will. For now he stays out of the Town tier and is in the Probably Town tier of my opinions.<br><br>The Seems Unlikely to Be Aligned With Pretty Obvious Scum Tier<br>Slandaar - I really don't think he's scum, if Thor is. And I think Thor is. If they are scum together though, they deserve to win just for the amount of baloney they put us through on Day 1. That amount of back and forth would be really hard to contrive on the fly with so many other factors (players) floating around and through the middle of it all. I still want to read Slandaar's posts for motivational tells though.<br><br>The Relatively Nothing Tier (Where Probably Resides At Least One Scum If Not Two)<br>TCold/havingfitz - Still need to read more of this slot. I have limited notes on TCold, and nothing on havingfitz.<br>Macros/Elyse - I had a vague opinion that Macros was townish, but I need to read much more deeply into that. Also, I have read nothing of Elyse.<br>Axxle/Skelda - Same as above, except exchange Macros for Axxle, and Elyse for Skelda.<br><br>The I Have Seen A Lot of Reasons To Think They're Scum Tier<br>Sir Bastion<br><br>The Pretty Obvious Scum Tier<br>Thor665 - Scum. No two ways about it. Consider my vote on him pending my reading being complete.<br><br>Also sorry for all the posts in a row but I'm on a roll here."}

I've played in a couple bastard mod theme games that I don't remember very well so it is possible but I'm pretty sure I haven't. I'm also pretty sure I've seen it fake claimed more than once. I have vague memories of being suspicious of it the second time for reasons I've stated but it has been a really long time I could be misremembering.<br><br>Anyways as a result, I've adopted a \"go ahead and lynch the claimed hider\" mindset, which is what I meant by \"typically lynch\" anyone who claims to be one.<br><br>If you think I'm a lying sack of shit who clearly remembers what every uncommon role is and does and deliberately lied about an offhand comment that didn't really matter to anything and am therefore scum then I doubt I can say anything further to change your mind."}

Ice and Thor could very well have been coordinating with ice the push back and forth. But at the same time, they would have known the second thor flipped the jig was up on them having daychat so any such plans would be dangerously flawed.<br><br>As for Fitz, if he had found a town pr I would expect he would have breadcrumbed it by at least giving a reads list and putting the player high in town reads. He gave no such reads list so my guess is whoever he looked at on night 1 returned as a vanilla which is worthless.<br><br><br>Very quickly I havnt found a daychat one yet, but from a few of Thor's games as scum in newbie games we get the following:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>scumthor wrote:</cite>I never 'plan' Day 1 as scum - I prefer to let it flow as it flows and see where it takes me.<br>Here's my default scum IC info speech;<br><br>Welcome to being dastardly scum, it is our job to kill the living bejeezus out of the town. I have a couple pieces of quick advice for you as newbie scum. Feel free to take what I say and mull it over with your own thoughts. I won't claim these are absolute rules of awesome, but I will say they appear to work pretty well in my opinion.<br><br>1. Try to post at least once a day. I know some people advocate lurking as a good scum tactic, I think it is a poor plan overall. Usually people who post consistently are less likely to be lynched than those that don't.<br><br>2. When you are attacked, do a controlled attack back. Now, you're almost assuredly going to be attacked at some point this game, and Day 1 is a likely time for it to happen. When you are attacked, don't ignore the attack, at the same time, don't pay attention only to the attack. The best way to respond to an attack is to address it...but then also, in the same post, make a continued press/question/attack on another player; here's an example;<br><br>Bad Idea<br>Player 1: U R Scumz!<br>You: No I'm not, U R Scumz!<br>Player 1: See how guilty he sounds? Vote pl0x!<br><br>Another Bad Idea<br>Player 1: U R Scumz!<br>You: No I'm not, you have no evidence. By the way, don't you agree that Player 2 is scumz?<br>Player 1: He's trying to deflect me onto Player 2, he is scumz! Lynch Woody na0w!<br><br>Good Idea<br>Player 1: U R Scumz!<br>You: No I'm not, let me see your case and I'll take it apart, it's silly to think I'm scum.<br><br>Oh, yeah, Player 2, earlier when you voted for Player 3 you never said why, what's up with that? Why do you think Player 3 is scum? What did you hope to gain by voting him without explaining why? Answer in your next post!<br><br>--------------<br><br>Make sense?<br><br>3. Forget you're scum. This is my gold standard advice. Here's my super scum strategy secret - TOWN GENERALLY HAS NO IDEA WHAT IT'S DOING AND MOST \"SCUMTELLS\" ARE MADE UP BALONEY. Don't \"try\" to get someone mislynched. DOn't do sudden vote switches just to get someone who is town mislynched. What you should do is honestly approach the game as though you were town, and vote people for the reasons you'd normally vote people. Make cases. Ask questions. Develop town reads and react to them like they're town. Develop scum reads and try to get those players lynched. Adjust your reads when new evidence shows up. If you do that all I pretty much promise you that unless a PR catches you that you'll make it to endgame.<br><br>4. Don't get tense if I attack you, I probably will - feel free to attack me if I look scummy, in fact I encourage it. But also feel free to blatantly buddy me if you think I look town. Keep an honest interaction with your partner (in a perfect world, forget that I'm your partner and react to me as honestly as possible).<br><br>5. If it looks like you're about to be lynched, it is not a bad idea to claim a PR - at least there's a chance you'll sucker out a real one,a nd if not then...hey, you may not be lynched. If you want to fakeclaim a PR it is best to decide which one you intend to do, and remember to PLAY LIKE THAT PR the whole game. Make decisions each night as to what your town PR night actions are - and allow your gameplay to *change* depending on the results you get. For instance - if you plan to claim cop, and decide you'd protect 'Player X' and there is no night kill that night - then prepare to treat 'Player X' like likely town for the rest of the game - and react a little cageishly if people ask you why. Stuff like that.<br><br>6. Have fun.

Good thing it isn't all town.<br><br>So here's my conspiracy theory that makes SO MUCH more sense now that we saw a daychat flip (<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">NOTE: I have never to memory encountered an encrypter before, but I have not only encountered scum with daychat but BEEN scum with daychat. Therefore I believe that either only Thor was allowed to post and the other read or Thor was able to have a one-on-one with one but not all scum. Otherwise they would just have daytalk powers and the name \"encrypter\" would not have been neccesary. I believe scum's daytalk abilities died with thor</span>) I think Slandaar is a very likely scum buddy for Thor.<br><br>Think about it. How many players told Slandaar to STFU and he never listened? Even Thor himself had an awkward response in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5385508#p5385508\" class=\"postlink\">post 462</a> that really made me make a weird face though I didn't understand at the time.

Both Slandaar and Thor damn well knew Thor wasn't going to be lynched d1.<br><br>I also suspect that there's a decent change Garmr was taking ques from Thor during d1 to push zakk while still lending support to the ABRwagon, and eventually throwing in his vote. I made a whole case on it during the weekend in a word doc, but one particular post from Garmr kind of throws a loop through the whole idea.<br><br>A quick look at vote counts shows Skelda as the most likely partner to Thor, and based literally just on the D1 lynch zakk is the only other possibility if neither Skelda nor Slandaar is scum.<br><br>Slandaar is the best bet here. For reasons stated earlier I think zakk is probtown, and while I feel like I have a decent case on Garmr, the one issue I have with that would cause me to hesitate to lynch him today. Skelda would be my second preference, and that's pretty much just PoE from votecounts, as there's virtually nothing to analyze in the whole slot.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote Slandaar</span>.<br><br>PEDIT: I was laughing because of how fucking ridiculous D1 was.

He has since come back towards the middle of the scale somewhat, but I would still much rather lynch him than anyone else (except Thor) at this point. I am quite willing to be convinced that he is not scum, in fact, I have a note saying that if Thor is scum, he is less likely to be... not sure why I thought that, but it's in my notes under both Thor and Sir Bastion. Anyway, post 16 felt very contrived, post 26 was a soft-defend of Thor, 37 seemed to imply that he had nothing better to do than ignore certain people while waiting for others to post, 40 brings up how he was town in other games (as if to imply he is town here, or at least plant some kind of subconscious seed), and it also brings up something solely in order to be able to say \"buuut, I'm not going to talk about it here\" which is sketchy at best. he also spouts game theory in that post which seems unnecessary. I don't like in post 42 where he says \"assuming I don't?\" because that is a giant deflection. more unnecessary game theory in post 45. Jumping over to 112, he sticks with a vote on GuthrieGov while admitting his reasoning is shallow. He also questions GG in 113 to find out if GG thinks poorly of him. That's a weird thing for a townie to do. In post 168 he appears to have a good catch, but I don't like the way he talks about it as if it's only in passing, and seems detached, with his ellipses (...) and it feels like he's trying to point out awkward things about somebody in order to get others to latch onto them and do the dirty work of lynching them for him. Post 182 complains about having to slog through the Thor/Slandaar noisefest again, but it almost seems like he's not actually going to do it, he just wants people to think he is, so they'll think he's trying to be useful. Whether or not that's the case here, I don't like the attitude of trying to show off the things you're doing to help the game, and it feels off to me. I wrote under that point \"Let's see if he comes up with anything worthwhile or is just posturing\" and I don't have any notes after that which cancel out that sentiment. So clearly that's bad, and supports my idea that he never actually did re-read it, he just tried to snag some town credit for saying he was going to. 234 is a bunch of words with disproportionately little actual analysis of what was said, and it seemed to me like he was making a larger post in order to try to keep up the amount of posts he had at a competitive level with those who were posting the most in the game, solely for the sake of being seen as being active by other people.<br><br>To put it all into a few sentences (in case you weren't following along and looking at the posts, which you really should do), here's the case: He appears to be very aware and very concerned about what others think of him. He appears to be trying to plant thoughts into other people's subconscious to get them to feel certain ways about him and others, and that's not something town does. They are quite a bit more blunt about it. Kind of like I'm being right now, actually. And also, I just get a pretty good gut feeling that he's not one of the good guys, and that's always a nice cherry on top of the icing for me. So, logically speaking, we should lynch him after Thor.<br></div></blockquote><br><br><br>thats waffle...<br><br>The only thing I see about Zakk's posting that sticks out is he suggests *like Ice* that you and thor were bussing on day 1.<br><br><br>EBWOP:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>And look its just too perfect 'IF SKELDA AND SLAND TOWN' (TRUE) Zakk is scum!

Nobody wants to read that baloney.<br><br>Third, your points are coming across as oddly self-serving.<br><br>It's almost like you can't wait to just lynch one guy and move on to the next, stopping only to loot the corpse for as much town cred as you can possibly squeeze out of it. That's an attitude I see more as coming from bussing scum than earnest town. Town seems to want to deliberate more. Heck, I want to deliberate for as long as possible now that I know that the mafia don't have day talk abilities any longer.<br><br>I mean, Sir Bastion makes a good point in his post #929; everyone is more or less back on the board, suspicion-wise.<br><br>For all we know, we have weak scum like Garmr who, though he screwed up at first, Thor realized he'd have to carry Garmr on his back and teach him how to play the newb card and manipulate people in ways that Thor can't seem to do because he's relatively more well known around the site. Taking this example to the extreme, it's entirely possible that Thor was even writing full posts for Garmr, sending them to him, and just having Garmr copy-paste them into his next forum post. That kind of anonymity would allow Thor to deliberately craft someone else's image without the responsibility of living up to certain expectations. That would be a pretty large advantage.<br><br>Secondly, it's entirely possible with the day talk ability that the mafia pulled some kind of sophisticated distancing act on Day 1 between two members that would help cement the two as different alignments in everyone's mind. Such an argument could be carefully controlled and coordinated back and forth on both the front end and on the back side and they could push and pull as necessary and pretend to try to get each other lynched. All the while, they would be looking for a scapegoat, someone else to take the blame. And until they found that scapegoat, they would continue to throw digs at each other and have ridiculous amounts of confirmation bias (sound familiar?) in their posts, arguing over such small details that nobody else could follow the argument, or quickly lost the desire to after such wanton repetition, and all of this relentlessly continuing far past the point of reason, such that everyone would write off the entire situation as townies infighting and therefore chalk it up to something that's better off left ignored because there is little to be gained. Because I know that's what I would do. Of course you realize by this point that I'm talking about you and Thor, during Day 1.<br><br>I mean, Slandaar, throw me a bone here. If you're such a profitable lynch that both Thor and IceNinja wanted out of the way (your very own comment on IceNinja's post 697, ring a bell?), then what's your brilliant hypothesis on why you haven't been killed at night yet?"}

This is the shortest chapter in the book because most of Slandaar\u2019s bad points fall somewhere into the grey area between fact and fiction, and in fact some of them (like accusations that zakk is scum) cannot, at the time of this writing, be objectively proven.<br><br>The second chapter covers things Slandaar has said that didn\u2019t make sense. This chapter is quite a bit longer, and contains most of those \u201cgrey-area\u201d statements that may or may not be true depending on certain factors.<br><br>The third chapter covers the rest of Slandaar\u2019s bad posts, and is primarily a compilation of examples of things I think he should improve on as a player.<br><br>Enjoy, my friends.</span>"}

The closest Thor got was L-3 and that was based on an admittedly made-up case from ABR. The reason your push against Thor wasn\u2019t successful is because even though you were making some good points, you argued them in such a way that you didn't convince almost anybody else, and layered them with ridiculous points and obnoxious quips. Honestly, I might have been on board with your case against Thor on day one if you had just given reasons as to why you were right rather than given the fact that you were right as the reason. Also if you had shown any willingness to explain your arguments to people who didn't understand them.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5396784#p5396784\" class=\"postlink\">post 713</a>, Slandaar wrote:</cite>That is called dodging questions which is the second time Thor has done it.</div></blockquote><br><br>You accuse Thor of dodging questions, and I believe you actually use that as part of your case against him.

And every one of those four had little to no effort put into them. So basically what you were saying is that there was no reason for us to gather input from a player who hadn\u2019t contributed much of anything.

It was not proven and ICE never professed to know what the hider did at the time of this game. Also, reacting to the hider flip in the way Elyse did required two pieces of knowledge:<br>1. Knowing that a hider dies if they hide behind scum.<br>2. Remembering that F-16 had hinted that he was going to hide behind Thor.<br>Even if ICE remembered what a hider did, he would have had to remember F-16's hint as well. Neither happened at first. Then, once it was explained to him, he agreed -- exactly as a townie would do. None of what happened in relation to the hider flip and ICE's reaction to it looked scummy; you looked at it as a scumtell because you were already convinced ICE was scum. This is called confirmation bias, and it is only the latest in a line of examples in your posts.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5414559#p5414559\" class=\"postlink\">post 946</a>, Slandaar wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5394819#p5394819\" class=\"postlink\">post 689</a>, ICEninja wrote:</cite>I've told you time and time again to actually contribute to this game instead of repeating over and over and over (ad nasium) about the same points that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">every single player in this game besides you</span> agree are meaningless.<br>I'm not the only one frustrated about it.

Sometimes you actually come across like you're philosophically opposed to laying out your reasoning or something. It takes persistent questioning to get you to explain what you mean.

Becuase I've read every single one of your posts in this game and all you said at the time was \"ABR is town...you should take this as fact.\" If it's a scumtell for ICE, it's a scumtell for you. Luckily for you, it wasn't a scumtell for ICE, because despite your assuredly flawless analysis of ICE's actions, he was town.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5415851#p5415851\" class=\"postlink\">post 983</a>, Slandaar wrote:</cite>Zakk is likely scum for what? who knows... and then Zakk not scum because max got nightkilled? how does this make any sense? IT DOESN'T.</div></blockquote><br><br>Who knows? You did. ICE had just posted all the reasons he thought zakk was town, and you quoted it in full. But instead of responding to his points, you act like they don't exist. And as long as you're going to assert that not explaining your points makes you scum, you're making a case for you being scum, because as I've pointed out, you rarely explain yourself.

So why be this obnoxious over something you clearly think has value? Doing so only makes people less likely to want to listen to you or engage you in any sort of rational debate.

Because Skelda also has a towny action (his \"townslip,\" which the now-confirmed-town Slandaar pointed out earlier in the game). So to me, it looks like the team is either Garmr/zakk or Garmr/Skelda.<br><br>But since the two most active players right now seem unwilling to lynch Garmr, I'll have to do a bit more digging before I know who to go for.<br><br>I guess the obvious choice would be Skelda, since both zakk and Elyse have suggested that they would be open to a Skelda lynch, but I'd still like to look into it a bit more.<br><br>A Skelda claim would make this easier."}

The scum team had used the daytalk pretty well for communication, but we were nowhere near the level people decided we were, and I think that did a lot to fuel paranoia and get some mislynches into play that otherwise wouldn't have been available to us."}

(I read the entire dead QT btw)<br><br>N - Great job modding. You were always active, attentive, and on-time. You did the right thing with Garmr's last vote but I don't think it would have mattered in the long run. You also ran a very cool setup, especially using Seraph Knight which is like my favorite role for some reason.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smiling.png\" alt=\":]\" title=\"Cheerful Smile\"> <br><br>havingfitz - Not much I can say really. You investigated the right person (Thor) but we caught you and NK'd you.<br><br>ICEninja - You didn't play as poorly as it's being made out to be. You had some misguided opinions and did not do much to dispute the suspicions on your slot. I think Thor did a great job of securing your mislynch on Day 3 during Day 2, and Slandaar's tunneling helped as well. You kept towning it up towards the end there and I was sweating it out until you got lynched.<br><br>zakk - You scared me in LyLo! I was not expecting you to come out of the gate so strong against me! You seemed really town to me but I had to fake that you were scummy to keep myself from being lynched. You had strong points (and a few stinkers  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">), but your previous lurking lost you the credibility you needed to get my lynch through. If you were consistently aggressive, you probably would have been able to convince tool/Skelda.<br><br>Garmr - You were a really great partner in LyLo. You distanced enough from me that the scumteam seemed to be Elyse/Skelda or zakk/Garmr and when everyone put the pieces together that you were a common scumread, you made sure to go down making me look town. It worked. And even if you got lynched, I think we would have won. Great job!<br><br>toolenduso - I thought you did a great job this game. Your book on Slandaar was sooo funny and good that it made me regret killing him because it would have been funny to see him respond to that. You were the level headed thinker the town needed in LyLo, but it was a hard situation to be in. You had a lurker, a newb, a townie player you expected to die, and a lurker-turned-aggressive scumhunter. It was a tough decision, but I think you would have been able to work it out if given enough time.<br><br>Sir Bastion - You were always obvtown to me and showed great logic throughout the game. I was really impressed with your play. Great work.<br><br>Slandaar - I felt like your play was more distracting than it was helpful in the long run, but had you made it to LyLo, I think you could have earned the town a victory. I did not feel comfortable with you in LyLo, and despite the suspicion on your slot, I knew you could turn it around on a dime and get me/Garmr lynched. Overall though, the thing with Thor on Day 1 lost you nearly all of your credibility, which you needed.<br><br>Thor665 - You were a really helpful scumbuddy and I enjoyed being on your team and conspiring with you. Your Day 2 play was great and it led us through the ICE mislynch unscathed, with a tunnelly Slandaar and a confused town. <br><br>Maxous - You were the player I feared the most going into Night 1. I wanted you killed upon replacing in, pretty much. Your reads were spot on and you had great, concise thoughts. You would have been an almost impossible mislynch. If you pushed your reads a little harder, the outcome of the game might have changed.<br><br>F-16_Fighting_Falcon - You hid behind the right person and left a great crumb the scum didn't notice/take seriously. Too bad I was the one who jumped on it and took the towncred!<br><br>Albert B. Rampage - I really dislike your criticism of tool after the game. Sure, your reads may have been right on Day 1, but you still played mind-bogglingly bad with your fake case and retraction of your scumread on Thor. You gave us the mislynch we needed. If you hadn't done that and stayed alive, I know you probably would have led town to victory. But you didn't and you shouldn't criticize tool because while you might have done better late-game, you need to survive early-game first. Tool did that and you could not.<br><br>Skelda - You lurked a little too much and you AtE'd towards the end, which isn't going to ease suspicions on you. I thought your LyLo play was decent, and I completely understand the conclusions you came to. I would've done the same if I was town in your shoes. Announcing you were going to vote zakk immediately the next day was a really bad move, because it gave me an easy path to victory. It didn't make a difference, but don't announce that next time. <br><br>And that's all folks. Thanks for a fun game!"}

My comment that it was my mistake holding your lynch back was that it gave your team more daychat, most of your comments of the day of day 2 went in one ear and out the other. But I doi think the play on having the watcher watch you was 1 of 2 moves that handed you the game so many applause for that.<br><br>@Elyse: fuuuuu, I even checked on day 2, I timed how long after game open that you posted your vote and I weighed it up as a plan by scum from the night before or not and deemed that 20 minutes was sufficent and that you were normally posting around 3am (my time). I checked it again day 3 when thor flipped encryptor and I gave you a pass because as I originally found you normally posted around 3am (my time) and when I died I still thought that maybe just maybe something I had said on day 3 got me killed.
