This is a game.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">General Stuff</div><br>\n<br>\n* Follow the website rules (please read them) If you have any questions for me, you may pm or you may ask in thread. If you ask in the thread, please start it with \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">mod:</div>\" so that I am more likely to see it.<br>\n* I don't like lurkers. Please be ready to post at the very least once every 2 days. Treat this game like a commitment. I will prod anyone as soon as I become aware that they haven't posted for 72 hs or more. If you are going to go away and not have access for more than 3 days, you must write so in this game thread. I will not check the V/LA section of this website.<br>\n* If a player ignores my prods, I may be forced to replace that player.<br>\n* I'll be using <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">red</div> or <div style=\"display:inline;color:#BF0040\">similar shades</div> as my colors, so don't use them!<br>\n* If someone violates any of these rules, I may modkill them, depending on the situation.<br>\n* You may not quote your role pms in any way.<br>\n* This is a mini normal and applies to that set of rules.<br>\n* On a lighter note, this is my first game that I'm modding, and I would like to thank ____________<br>\n* On yet another note, I may choose to include flavor with night kills and with lynches. None of my flavor will reveal anything about the game, and if you think the flavor hints at something, you're wrong.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">During the day:</div><br>\n<br>\n* During the day, all players may cast one vote on any other player in the game. It takes a simple majority of votes to lynch a player. The vote must be bolded and in the form <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote: Player</div>. As soon as the final vote is cast on a player, that player is lynched and I will lock the thread as soon as I see it.  Abbreviations are accepted as long as they make clear who you're referring to.<br>\n* You may also remove your vote from that person by simply putting <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">unvote: Player</div>. Unvoting before voting again is encouraged, but not mandatory.<br>\n* In addition, players may vote to end the day without lynching. This is done by posting a simple <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote: nolynch</div>. It takes half of the players alive, rounded up, to cause a nolynch.<br>\n* I will post a votecount as often as I feel necessary (maybe once a day).<br>\n* I will set deadlines if discussion lags. I have a predetermined system of when to set a deadline based on activity and how long the day has lasted. I will mention the deadline at least a week ahead of time.<br>\n* In the event of a tie there will be a nolynch.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">During the night, and other things</div><br>\n<br>\n* Night is defined as any time (after the game has started) when the game thread is locked.<br>\n* If a player has an ability to talk to another player, then they may communicate from the time they get their pm to the time I begin the game in their respective Quicktopic.<br>\n* I will begin the game when everyone has picked up their role and confirmed in the thread or 72 hs have passed.<br>\n* Once you are dead, you may not post but a single bah! post with no information. If you would like to be pmed when the game is over (although I hope you will follow along), then let me know via pm.<br>\n* I might add a dead quicktopic for you to chat post-game.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>SAMPLE TOWNIE ROLE PM: wrote:</cite> IIIIIIIIII , you're a Vanilla Townie, you've got no other powers than your skills and presence of mind.<br>\n<br>\n    You win if all threats to the town are eliminated and at least one town-aligned player is alive.<br>\n<br>\n    Confirm in the thread: <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=17830\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1193: Hacker's Panic mafia.</a> </div></blockquote>", "time": "Sat Jun 18, 2011 12:51 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17830&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "17830"}

Dissenters are struck down even before they can try to spread their ideas.  The network is all seeing and all powerful<br>\n<br>\nExcept... that's not entirely true.<br>\n<br>\nBrilliant minds, reckless souls, valiant heros, adrenaline junkies, no one will never really know their motives.  But those who are interested in the inner workings of things, those who are genuinely curious, wield the weapon to bring it all down.<br>\n<br>\nYou, hackers, are the true enemy.<br>\n<br>\nThe corporations know this and they're resources are vast.  They've taken so many cells and even lone hackers that we've reached a point where those who remain hidden, can't envision any other solution than striking a fatal blow to the network's most vital points.  If the communications and control systems are crushed.  They can provide the necessary timegap for people to stand up against the oppresion. <br>\n<br>\nThis job can't be done by one or two people.  It needs to be a collective effort.  But teamwork requires trust, and you guys have none, albeit not without reason.<br>\n<br>\nYou've discovered logs that indicate people are leaking information of your online meetings.  This job can't be pulled off unless you unmask the posers but, if you make a mistake, you'll be only weakening yourselves.       <br>\n<br>\nCan you neutralize the threat before it's too late?

I don't think I've personally ever seen a full shot vig in a mini normal I've played but I have seen even/odd night vigs and a one shot vig is less shots than those so I don't really get the implication that a one shot vig in a mini normal is unbalanced or soooo unlikely. In fact, wasn't some of the justification for having the mini limit increase to a player base of 13 to incorporate a vig to increase town chances of winning? This just seems like an off the cuff reason to power through the lynch with no substantive base in reality.

{"number": 201, "id": "3162898", "user": "xvart", "user_id": "12213", "content": "It is true. We are neighbors. I've been racking my brain for the life of me about our moderator and his opinions on neighbors since we were in a game together a while back and there were two town neighbors but Humble didn't say anything definitive about neighbors and alignments other than alignments are unknown. don did not talk in the neighbor QT at all pre game. <br>\n<br>\ndon didn't say anything pre game in the neighbor QT which I thought was... not damning evidence of him being scum but not scoring any town points, and I really started suspecting him as scum neighbor on his beck wagon support but no vote, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3150046#p3150046\" class=\"postlink\">when I tied him to Beck</a>. I almost came out right there and claimed neighbor since don hadn't done anything at all except that scummy post but I thought better of it. Last night, don was absent until over halfway through night. My first post of the night was asking him who he thought was scum because he had provided no reads at all D1. I was hoping to draw out something and see what he did at the beginning of the next day and then claim what I knew if it contradicted what he said during the night. I then sent a \"you there?\" type post and then followed up with more friendly banter post in case he was scum and relayed his information to his team and I got NKed without claiming him as my neighbor. My post was basically how I thought <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3144322#p3144322\" class=\"postlink\">his crumb</a>, although obvious, was clever and asked him if he was worried about scum picking up on it. On D1 I was thinking it was obvious and was curious why he wasn't so concerned with scum picking up on it. <br>\n<br>\nHe finally posted in the neighbor QT with how scum might use that knowledge to their benefit (??) but he believe it to be better play for neighbors to be more public than private (paraphrased). He also said he wasn't reading carefully during D1 so he was going to reread if he survived the night. This struck me as really odd since I saw him as no threat to being a NK. I asked him if he thought he was likely to be killed during the night. He responded that he hoped not, then said there had to be scum in the final few people on the wagon.<br>\n<br>\nNow that I had a weak set of suspects from him I was waiting to see who he voted for at the start of D2. He came out and immediately voted the hammerer for a very specific reason; so what I don't understand is why he didn't tell me that last night.<br>\n<br>\nThe other thing that concerns me is that he so quickly claimed neighbor today when I put him in a very loose scum group pairing and he didn't do the same yesterday when I did the same thing. The only thing I can see is that it is possible he knew that Beck wasn't scum so wasn't worried about that claim going through but maybe it struck a chord with my pairing and someone (or both) of his team being mentioned.<br>\n<br>\nI have never played with don (to my recollection) but from this game I don't see him as a player who would place a breadcrumb like he did so I'm guessing, if he is scum, he was prompted to do so in the scum QT pre-game. <br>\n<br>\nI didn't but out with this information because a lot of it is circumstantial and I didn't want to prematurely claim and was hoping I could draw out some more in subsequent nights.<br>\n<br>\ndon - can you show a game where you have breadcrumbed your role before?

He also said he wasn't reading carefully during D1 so he was going to reread if he survived the night. This struck me as really odd since I saw him as no threat to being a NK. I asked him if he thought he was likely to be killed during the night. He responded that he hoped not, then said there had to be scum in the final few people on the wagon.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\ni made it a policy early in my career to not read at night. i spent several hours reading an extremely long game one time and woke up dead. even if you are scum, there is no \"guarantee\" that you will survive, so reading at night is a waste of time. and i did believe there was scum on the end of the wagon, and i still do. townies shouldn't be quicklynching a fellow like that.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>xvart wrote:</cite>Now that I had a weak set of suspects from him I was waiting to see who he voted for at the start of D2.

Second, I 100% agree with Beck's initial stance on not letting the town direct the vig kill.  Beck was the town's biggest target; from his perspective he had absolutely no reason to trust everybody else's scumdar.  People arguing that Beck was being anti-town here are scummy.<br>\n<br>\nIn context, Beck's reversal after people made it clear that he would get lynched makes perfect sense.  Powerroles can't do shit if they get lynched before they can use their power.  It occasionally behooves the vanilla townie to accept their lynch as an inevitability, but rarely the powerrole.  People who are claiming to not understand that are scummy.<br>\n<br>\nI did not like Celebloki's hammer at all, for obvious reasons.  I don't care for Bob's response to my question about the hammer, though.  I expected I would get an opinion about how quickly the hammer came, especially since several people like myself, Hrezs, and deselby hadn't adequately discussed the Beckwagon.  Instead bob repeated an earlier feeling he had about the comment Celebloki made prior to hammering.  I acknowledge that with the way I phrased the question bobsnox technically did not dodge my question, but I find it odd that he had no opinion on the speed of the hammer either way.<br>\n<br>\ndon_johnson is obvtown and should not be lynched today.<br>\n<br>\nThe case on deselby is incredibly weak, and deselby is acting appropriately.  This, in turn, makes bob's continued pushing of deselby bizarre.  <br>\n<br>\nBob has posited a scumteam with CooLskins and deselby.  Parama has posited a scumteam with CooLskins and Hrezs.  Each of them is voting for the non-CooLskins partner.  This strikes me as odd; assuming each of them is town, they should think that they have an opportunity to convince another player to lynch one of their scumreads, and a CooLskins wagon should start.

In fact, wasn't some of the justification for having the mini limit increase to a player base of 13 to incorporate a vig to increase town chances of winning?

And I really like your sensationalized account of don and I and are apparent \"argument.\" Also, it should be apparent why I believe you to be scum which is equally interesting since you just railed on someone for not reading your posts to find your case; so either you are just trying to make me seem like I don't know what I'm doing or you are hoping I back down to your wheee authority.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Parama, 283 wrote:</cite>and nothing about why I'm scum. neato.you have nothing except this supposed \"scumslip\" which was just you misrepping me, and blatantly at that. excuse me while I refrain from moving my vote <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"></div></blockquote>Gosh.

The fact that you didn't even address the point about the contradiction (and your reasoning is terrigut). You voted Celeboki on the basis that hammering a VI OSV was a scumtell (and even went as far to say if the OSV flips OSV then you need to relearn how to scumhunt if the hammerer is town). That's a pretty definitive scumtell. Then, two posts later you said oh hammering a VI isn't a scumtell at all (with the justification that \"Celeblokis refusal should make him jump up in scumminess, but for some reason it just gives of a town vibe.\"). When everything you have said indicates that Celebloki is scum and should be scum based on his responses, but for some reason you get a gut town read and unvote.

[/quote]<br>\nYour case is bullshit because it never quotes any of the two (parama and bob) you are talking about. Without a quote we have no reference to what we are talking about, you could (and in some cases probably are) misrepresenting them at some point. We can't even be sure that they said the things that you say they are saying. It also doesn't help that the whole top paragraph is speculative/wifom which contributes little to nothing to your apparent bob suspicion (ohh, you mean the guy who flipped town tracker? Oh yeah him.).<br>\n<br>\nThe bottom part is still speculation, and not really that logial at all. As a tracker you track your scummiest read to see if they kill. However, if that player is in fact scum and know that he is taking a lot of heat then one of his buddies will take the kill instead. In ine of my last scum games we knew that there was a tracker/watcher combo, we debated to the end of the night deadline who would submit the kill. Odly enough the tracker actually tracked one of my scum buddies. While bob is speculating about scum actions he is a tracker. Its almost his job to make an educated guess at who will submit the kill so that he can track that person to it.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>don wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>skins wrote:</cite>[goodposting=\"parama\"]<blockquote><div><cite>Parama wrote:</cite>Bwahahaha, dj's definitely the scum neighbor. \"I think bobsnox is scum, and I think Parama is scum by association, so let me lynch the player who I feel is scum by association instead of the one who I feel is scum for actual reasons.\"<br>\nAt least the Zodiark wagon's the leading wagon again <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"></div></blockquote>[/goodposting]<br>\nThis is exactly what I'm thinking by reading his posts.

That's kinda the point at looking at your posts to find your true intention/motivation/stance.

You are a single player slot and the convenience and timing of the contradiction in light of Zodiark's scum flip is damning to say the least. <br>\n<br>\nI know it is hard for scum to think about things in an objective and unbiased light (especially when they are the focal point), but honestly, if one player said \"oh I think Player X is town/null despite the case presented\", then Player Y comes in and says \"that is a scummy post\", then the player comes back and says \"oh yeah, vote: Player X\" you don't find that the least bit scummy? I understand schizophrenic hydras having contradictory reads but the way to parse out whether or not they are scum or just a poor playing town hydra is motive and intent. The timing of your contradiction is incredibly scummy, and I'm not exactly going to trust your word on Bub having a scum read on Zodiark since <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">there had been no posts by your player slot regarding Zodiark being scummy prior to the contradiction</div> to substantiate this claim.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>CooLskins, 563 wrote:</cite>We did talk about it.

You can't say, \"because he tracked scum N2 he's less likely to have tracked scum N1\". That's logically equivalent to saying during D2, \"if you track scum N2, then whoever you tracked last night is less likely to be scum,\" which is clearly nonsense. <br>\n<br>\nIf you flip two coins, before you look at them, there's only a 1/4 chance of both being heads. But if your second flip is heads, that doesn't change the fact your first flip has 1/2 chance of being heads. Same deal here.

I think my points against them are reasonable, and the L-1 vote on Beck is clearly worse than the xvart's on the hrezs wagon. But, looking more at AH and havingfitz's interactions with Zodiark as per havingfitz's request, I see AntiHero was first to point out Zodiark's contradiction, which led to the wagon on him. But, if this was bussing, agreed in advance, then havingfitz would have stuck with AntiHero's scum-read on Zodiark when he replaced in, rather than weakening. <br>\n<br>\nHmm. I think I might have tunnelled too hard on kondi because of my anger about the D1 let's-lynch-the-claimed-vig epic fail (and yes it was, even if he wouldn't play ball and let his kill be directed). I also had a scum read on Celeboki right up until he flipped town.<br>\n<br>\n-- <br>\n<br>\n@havingfitz: xvart strikes me as genuine scumhunting in that his uncertainty and attempts to assess people's alignment feel genuine to me. The results wagonwise haven't been good but that's not what my read was based on. It's more that he looks very much like town working from a position of ignorance rather than scum acting from more complete knowledge. <br>\n<br>\n--<br>\n<br>\nWhere does all this leave me? <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: CooLskins</div><br>\n<br>\nPartly PoE because I don't think either neighbour is scum, and havingfitz's weakening of his slot's scum read on Zodiark doesn't fit with bussing, so I've softened on him.

Saying \"what a stupid kill\" with the implication that he would not have made that kill and therefore isn't scum. Furthermore, the fact that CooLskins says that bob was obvious town is a good enough motive for the kill, coupled with bob being a tracker seems like a good reason to kill from his eyes.

But, looking more at AH and havingfitz's interactions with Zodiark as per havingfitz's request, I see AntiHero was first to point out Zodiark's contradiction, which led to the wagon on him.

Antihero spent most of his time attacking Celiboski, who was an easy scumtarget for a mislynch becaue of the hammer. Also, he didn't push Zodiark much at all, and he only mentioned the slip in passing.

CooLskins talks about the \"very strong case against the fitz player slot\" in post 601, but he's voting don_johnson: this fits with the 'put buddy in #2 slot, vote townie' approach to being scum, if don's town. Earlier, he FoSes kondi while voting don (iso15), and does an \"I think kondi's scummiest but Bub thinks don's scummiest so we're voting don\" split read thing in iso16. The main difficulty is it would mean he's bussing both his buddies when he calls Zodiark and havingfitz scumbuddies in iso48. But then, he still pushes harder for a don lynch today, so it's possible they're buddies looking from this direction. <br>\n<br>\nhavingfitz doesn't comment on CooLskins at all until iso9, where he has a little tirade against him. And then, calm again in iso10. I think the end of iso9 could be scum distancing. The 'his posts are scummy but I think he's town' line he takes in iso13 is convenient for giving him an excuse if CooLskins flips scum (\"well I did say his posts were scummy\"), as does tying his town read to a scum read on xvart (\"I did say skins is scum if xvart's town, I just didn't think xvart is town\"). AntiHero and kondi don't interact with or give reads on CooLskins at all. It's plausible they're buddies looking from this direction. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nOoh, another important point I just noticed about havingfitz, separate to xvart's point about his vote hop, but based on the same post:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>fitz 586 wrote:</cite>don scum will point to dselby IMO.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis theory comes despite the \"xvart town = skins scum\" line in iso12 and \"xvart town = Parama or CooLskins scum\" in iso15. If don's scum, that means xvart's town, yet fitz doesn't mention these previous conditional theories of his.

I just really disliked this post, and can only see sum motivation for posting it - ie to make town reluctant to lynch a neighbour (very probably you at this opoint) in any circumstance.

It is safer to lynch the player most likely to be scum.

He's not scum with xvart because scum don't claim neighbors with each other, they claim masons.

A game just finished where both D1 and D2 the competing wagons were both scum and this logic almost cleared me when I replaced in. While I personally didn't have a solid scum read on don yesterday compared to CooLskins, I was cognizant of the things people were saying yesterday. I think the fact that both of us are alive today indicates strongly that don could possibly be scum. If you think about it, if we both were town one of us should have died last night to push the whole \"one neighbor must be scum\" idea and lead the town into game over. If don is scum they couldn't kill me because of the heat don was getting yesterday as he would be an auto lynch. <br>\n<br>\nIn our neighbor QT last night I posted that CooLskins must die tomorrow (today) due to everything I said yesterday plus that super scummy hammer without even asking for a claim. I also posted that I had a town read on don even though that wasn't exactly true to see if I could fish out some information prior to day beginning pending the night kill cementing my read on him either way. I closed the first post of the night by saying that I wouldn't be shocked if one of us was killed during night to put the town in a LYLO situation tomorrow forcing the other neighbor to be lynched. <br>\n<br>\nDon said he concurred with the CooLskins hammer being awful and said he had a null read on deselby and that imagine was town. I agreed with his assessment on Imagine and then dropped how mad I would be for not pushing CooLskins and Parama harder the first two days if they turned out to be the scum team. Don came back and said the Parama connection to CooLskins should be clear if CooLskins flips scum. Then says he is hesitant about Parama being scum in this game state. He said he hopes we both survive the night as we are stronger as a unified front. The wishes me good luck. <br>\n<br>\nBased on everything that happened yesterday with the don wagon I would be the obvious NK if don was town. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Parama wrote:</cite>This game is the trainwreck that never should've been &lt;.&lt;</div></blockquote><br>\nlol.

If don and CooLskins are scum they knew I was going to be gunning for CooLskins and they knew that don was also going to come out strong against them today, too. Since they both were under fire yesterday I suspect they are setting up a 1v1 with them knowing what I said in the neighbor QT so when one flips they buy town cred.<br>\n<br>\nCooLskins - is there a reason you didn't ask for a claim yesterday when we weren't close to a deadline?<br>\n<br>\nI am confident that CooLskins and don are the remaining scum.", "time": "Sun Aug 07, 2011 3:20 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17830&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "17830"}

I know because I've been there.  In a town neighborhood.  It's safe to assume from the start that the other one is scum just to prevent foul play but, as you go, you can manage to build trust and use it to your advantage.<br>\n<br>\nIt puts town and scum in interesting situations.  There's a bit more outguessing the mod, there's 2 less VTs but no addition of  game-breaking power roles. <br>\n<br>\nI think these neighbors worked quite well for a while, with don being sometimes scummy and xvart being pro-town.  The fact that don claimed first made him less likely to be scum, as scum would prefer killing the neighbor before anyone could make the connection.  I do not think the problem here relied on neighbors.  Scum's actions were mainly decided by the PR info they got n1 so they pretty much had an optimal night strategy which they followed.  Town's problem ran along the lines of most town players being scummy, impatient and those who were pro-town enough and stopped to think before acting didn't take an active role in stopping all the madness that ensued.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>from HP's old setup creation notes wrote:</cite><br>\nThe last choice is just playing the old neighbor WIFOM having 4 townies and 2 town neighbors (unconfirmed alignment). The effectiveness of the role depends on the paranoia and trust they can exert to each other and the ideas that other players might have about setups with neighbors.<br>\nIt might be a good way to provide diversity if  [...] seems too much of a bonus for town. If none of these are good. We can always go for 6 townies but diversity is key to prevent frustration of players who dislike mountainous-like scenarios.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nBut I shouldn't be writing this right now.  :S  <br>\n<br>\nI'll provide further explanations and highlights on <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Thursday</div> Friday.<br>\n<br>\nHP<br>\n<br>\nPS: If anyone ever wants a co-mod or backup-mod count me in.

This game is further proof for me that I need to focus on not tunneling so hard and step back and look at the bigger picture once in a while.
