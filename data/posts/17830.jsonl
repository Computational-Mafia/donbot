This is a game.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">General Stuff</span><br><br>* Follow the website rules (please read them) If you have any questions for me, you may pm or you may ask in thread. If you ask in the thread, please start it with \"<span class=\"noboldsig\">mod:</span>\" so that I am more likely to see it.<br>* I don't like lurkers. Please be ready to post at the very least once every 2 days. Treat this game like a commitment. I will prod anyone as soon as I become aware that they haven't posted for 72 hs or more. If you are going to go away and not have access for more than 3 days, you must write so in this game thread. I will not check the V/LA section of this website.<br>* If a player ignores my prods, I may be forced to replace that player.<br>* I'll be using <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">red</span></span> or <span style=\"color: #BF0040\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">similar shades</span></span> as my colors, so don't use them!<br>* If someone violates any of these rules, I may modkill them, depending on the situation.<br>* You may not quote your role pms in any way.<br>* This is a mini normal and applies to that set of rules.<br>* On a lighter note, this is my first game that I'm modding, and I would like to thank ____________<br>* On yet another note, I may choose to include flavor with night kills and with lynches. None of my flavor will reveal anything about the game, and if you think the flavor hints at something, you're wrong.<br><br><strike>During the day:</strike><br><br>* During the day, all players may cast one vote on any other player in the game. It takes a simple majority of votes to lynch a player. The vote must be bolded and in the form <span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: Player</span>. As soon as the final vote is cast on a player, that player is lynched and I will lock the thread as soon as I see it.  Abbreviations are accepted as long as they make clear who you're referring to.<br>* You may also remove your vote from that person by simply putting <span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote: Player</span>. Unvoting before voting again is encouraged, but not mandatory.<br>* In addition, players may vote to end the day without lynching. This is done by posting a simple <span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: nolynch</span>. It takes half of the players alive, rounded up, to cause a nolynch.<br>* I will post a votecount as often as I feel necessary (maybe once a day).<br>* I will set deadlines if discussion lags. I have a predetermined system of when to set a deadline based on activity and how long the day has lasted. I will mention the deadline at least a week ahead of time.<br>* In the event of a tie there will be a nolynch.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">During the night, and other things</span><br><br>* Night is defined as any time (after the game has started) when the game thread is locked.<br>* If a player has an ability to talk to another player, then they may communicate from the time they get their pm to the time I begin the game in their respective Quicktopic.<br>* I will begin the game when everyone has picked up their role and confirmed in the thread or 72 hs have passed.<br>* Once you are dead, you may not post but a single bah! post with no information. If you would like to be pmed when the game is over (although I hope you will follow along), then let me know via pm.<br>* I might add a dead quicktopic for you to chat post-game.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SAMPLE TOWNIE ROLE PM: wrote:</cite> IIIIIIIIII , you're a Vanilla Townie, you've got no other powers than your skills and presence of mind.<br><br>    You win if all threats to the town are eliminated and at least one town-aligned player is alive.<br><br>    Confirm in the thread: <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=17830\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1193: Hacker's Panic mafia.</a> </div></blockquote>"}

Liberty has decreased in the world to the point where big corporations don't even have to pretend that they're not completely in control of the political decisions.<br>The age of information has transformed into a time of absolute vigilance and control.  Dissenters are struck down even before they can try to spread their ideas.  The network is all seeing and all powerful<br><br>Except... that's not entirely true.<br><br>Brilliant minds, reckless souls, valiant heros, adrenaline junkies, no one will never really know their motives.  But those who are interested in the inner workings of things, those who are genuinely curious, wield the weapon to bring it all down.<br><br>You, hackers, are the true enemy.<br><br>The corporations know this and they're resources are vast.  They've taken so many cells and even lone hackers that we've reached a point where those who remain hidden, can't envision any other solution than striking a fatal blow to the network's most vital points.  If the communications and control systems are crushed.  They can provide the necessary timegap for people to stand up against the oppresion. <br><br>This job can't be done by one or two people.  It needs to be a collective effort.  But teamwork requires trust, and you guys have none, albeit not without reason.<br><br>You've discovered logs that indicate people are leaking information of your online meetings.  This job can't be pulled off unless you unmask the posers but, if you make a mistake, you'll be only weakening yourselves.       <br><br>Can you neutralize the threat before it's too late?

In fact, wasn't some of the justification for having the mini limit increase to a player base of 13 to incorporate a vig to increase town chances of winning?

We are neighbors. I've been racking my brain for the life of me about our moderator and his opinions on neighbors since we were in a game together a while back and there were two town neighbors but Humble didn't say anything definitive about neighbors and alignments other than alignments are unknown. don did not talk in the neighbor QT at all pre game. <br><br>don didn't say anything pre game in the neighbor QT which I thought was... not damning evidence of him being scum but not scoring any town points, and I really started suspecting him as scum neighbor on his beck wagon support but no vote, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3150046#p3150046\" class=\"postlink\">when I tied him to Beck</a>. I almost came out right there and claimed neighbor since don hadn't done anything at all except that scummy post but I thought better of it. Last night, don was absent until over halfway through night. My first post of the night was asking him who he thought was scum because he had provided no reads at all D1. I was hoping to draw out something and see what he did at the beginning of the next day and then claim what I knew if it contradicted what he said during the night. I then sent a \"you there?\" type post and then followed up with more friendly banter post in case he was scum and relayed his information to his team and I got NKed without claiming him as my neighbor. My post was basically how I thought <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3144322#p3144322\" class=\"postlink\">his crumb</a>, although obvious, was clever and asked him if he was worried about scum picking up on it. On D1 I was thinking it was obvious and was curious why he wasn't so concerned with scum picking up on it. <br><br>He finally posted in the neighbor QT with how scum might use that knowledge to their benefit (??) but he believe it to be better play for neighbors to be more public than private (paraphrased). He also said he wasn't reading carefully during D1 so he was going to reread if he survived the night. This struck me as really odd since I saw him as no threat to being a NK. I asked him if he thought he was likely to be killed during the night. He responded that he hoped not, then said there had to be scum in the final few people on the wagon.<br><br>Now that I had a weak set of suspects from him I was waiting to see who he voted for at the start of D2. He came out and immediately voted the hammerer for a very specific reason; so what I don't understand is why he didn't tell me that last night.<br><br>The other thing that concerns me is that he so quickly claimed neighbor today when I put him in a very loose scum group pairing and he didn't do the same yesterday when I did the same thing. The only thing I can see is that it is possible he knew that Beck wasn't scum so wasn't worried about that claim going through but maybe it struck a chord with my pairing and someone (or both) of his team being mentioned.<br><br>I have never played with don (to my recollection) but from this game I don't see him as a player who would place a breadcrumb like he did so I'm guessing, if he is scum, he was prompted to do so in the scum QT pre-game. <br><br>I didn't but out with this information because a lot of it is circumstantial and I didn't want to prematurely claim and was hoping I could draw out some more in subsequent nights.<br><br>don - can you show a game where you have breadcrumbed your role before? And weren't you V/LA until the 27th?"}

My reasoning can be seen from the post in which I voted you. I voted you because you made an accusation of a scum team based on nothing more than a pregame greeting. Farcically weak IMO. I said my vote would stand unless you provided more or better reasoning. You did not. The only thing it seems I don't understand is why you still maintain there is something in your original claim. If this remains the case, I will consider your accusation scummy. My vote will change if this situation changes or someone else becomes scummier."}

Last night, don was absent until over halfway through night.</div></blockquote><br><br>thats because i hadn't even realized a lynch went through. i was rather surprised.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>xvart wrote:</cite> My first post of the night was asking him who he thought was scum because he had provided no reads at all D1.</div></blockquote><br><br>i hadn't been keeping up fast enough. like i said, i posted, next time i looked the lynch had gone through. i may have checked in once or twice between(can't recall), but i am in several games which have been requiring more attention and i didn't think a day 1 wagon would go so quick.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>xvart wrote:</cite> I was hoping to draw out something and see what he did at the beginning of the next day and then claim what I knew if it contradicted what he said during the night. I then sent a \"you there?\" type post and then followed up with more friendly banter post in case he was scum and relayed his information to his team and I got NKed without claiming him as my neighbor.</div></blockquote><br><br>i just about claimed neighbor in my op, so setting you up in such a fashion would be silly.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>xvart wrote:</cite> My post was basically how I thought <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3144322#p3144322\" class=\"postlink\">his crumb</a>, although obvious, was clever and asked him if he was worried about scum picking up on it. On D1 I was thinking it was obvious and was curious why he wasn't so concerned with scum picking up on it.</div></blockquote><br><br>i explained this in the qt saying \" its better for neighbors to be out in the open\"(paraphrased). neighbors are a tricky role because of the usual assumption that one is scum and one is town(which is a common argument for lynching one without aactual evidence.) by being open about it i feel like it actually gives town a better advantage.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>xvart wrote:</cite>He finally posted in the neighbor QT with how scum might use that knowledge to their benefit (??) but he believe it to be better play for neighbors to be more public than private (paraphrased). He also said he wasn't reading carefully during D1 so he was going to reread if he survived the night. This struck me as really odd since I saw him as no threat to being a NK. I asked him if he thought he was likely to be killed during the night. He responded that he hoped not, then said there had to be scum in the final few people on the wagon.</div></blockquote><br><br>i made it a policy early in my career to not read at night. i spent several hours reading an extremely long game one time and woke up dead. even if you are scum, there is no \"guarantee\" that you will survive, so reading at night is a waste of time. and i did believe there was scum on the end of the wagon, and i still do. townies shouldn't be quicklynching a fellow like that.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>xvart wrote:</cite>Now that I had a weak set of suspects from him I was waiting to see who he voted for at the start of D2.

I don't care for Bob's response to my question about the hammer, though.  I expected I would get an opinion about how quickly the hammer came, especially since several people like myself, Hrezs, and deselby hadn't adequately discussed the Beckwagon.  Instead bob repeated an earlier feeling he had about the comment Celebloki made prior to hammering.

Each of them is voting for the non-CooLskins partner.

Also, it was dropped on a really crappy tell (AtE, that's the best you can do?)<br>Celebolki actually said a couple pages before that he \"wasn't comfortable dropping the hammer\" or something to that effect.  This cautiousness vanished in the subsequent pages for no apparent reason.<br><br>The next day is met with combativeness and the whole \"oh poor me, I'm an easy target\" routine (also, Beck wasn't a VI).  If Cele is being used as a fall guy, it certainly isn't being reflected in the vote count.  Why is anyone OK with him, again?"}

I don't think I've personally ever seen a full shot vig in a mini normal I've played but I have seen even/odd night vigs and a one shot vig is less shots than those so I don't really get the implication that a one shot vig in a mini normal is unbalanced or soooo unlikely. In fact, wasn't some of the justification for having the mini limit increase to a player base of 13 to incorporate a vig to increase town chances of winning? This just seems like an off the cuff reason to power through the lynch with no substantive base in reality. Based on your opinion do you think a full vig or an even/odd vig is even less likely than a full vig in a mini normal?</div></blockquote><br>the only advantage of an OSV kill over a lynch is that it's guaranteed to come from a townie, but the major disadvantage is that a single townie can be biased.</div></blockquote>I don't find this explanation acceptable and you conveniently didn't even consider that a lynch can be biased as well. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Parama, 281 wrote:</cite>And I had a good idea of who Beck would've shot. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\"></div></blockquote>And this concerns me greatly since you were so adamant about him being lynched.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Parama, 281 wrote:</cite>P.S.

Also, even if you throw it around \"like a boss\" the implication is still more than a casual scum read. Plus, I don't even see really see why you believe he was confirmed scum other than he double RVSed with Beck and some cursory responses to CooLskins. Can you elaborate on what double RVSing means and why this indicates if how one of them is scum?<br><sup><span class=\"noboldsig\">3</span></sup> This final string of questions is just laughable at your attempt to undermine me by saying I was the one that called CooLskins confirmed scum couldn't be more obvious.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Parama, 282 wrote:</cite>your ISO has one point about me, and also includes you saying I'm town<br>whereas you have a huge fight with don including a wall-o-text-war.<br>What makes me scummier than him, just wondering?

And I really like your sensationalized account of don and I and are apparent \"argument.\" Also, it should be apparent why I believe you to be scum which is equally interesting since you just railed on someone for not reading your posts to find your case; so either you are just trying to make me seem like I don't know what I'm doing or you are hoping I back down to your wheee authority.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Parama, 283 wrote:</cite>and nothing about why I'm scum. neato.you have nothing except this supposed \"scumslip\" which was just you misrepping me, and blatantly at that. excuse me while I refrain from moving my vote <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"></div></blockquote>Gosh.

The fact that you didn't even address the point about the contradiction (and your reasoning is terrigut). You voted Celeboki on the basis that hammering a VI OSV was a scumtell (and even went as far to say if the OSV flips OSV then you need to relearn how to scumhunt if the hammerer is town). That's a pretty definitive scumtell. Then, two posts later you said oh hammering a VI isn't a scumtell at all (with the justification that \"Celeblokis refusal should make him jump up in scumminess, but for some reason it just gives of a town vibe.\"). When everything you have said indicates that Celebloki is scum and should be scum based on his responses, but for some reason you get a gut town read and unvote.

I am voting based on evidence that has happened the last couple days. This is such a waste of time. Besides,<blockquote><div><cite>Humble Poirot wrote:</cite>In the event that AFK players had night actions they will be performed randomly (unless they have teammates to choose their actions for them).</div></blockquote>The biggest issue with my 2nd theory is that the Mod only listed two awol players (antihero and haschel), and I do think there are 3 scum.

I didn't back down to save my own skin. It doesn't make any sense that I would do that even if I were scum. It shows that I was actually thinking about what was going on.

I will try not to damage your sanity too much.</div></blockquote><br><br>CooLskins said, and I quote, that he \"didn't want two complete noobs...\", not that he didn't want to play with noobs full stop.</div></blockquote><br><br>Makes some slightly irrelavent comments and does nothing to further the wagon on a person whom he thinks is certainly scum. Next post:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Zodiark13 wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Celeblokis refusal should make him jump up in scumminess, but for some reason it just gives of a town vibe.

And he mainly sheeps his reasons to boot. But wait:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Zodiark13 wrote:</cite>So, I'm being suspected for not liking yesterdays hammer, then, finding the non-defense townish, moving onto my next scum read? Right.<br><br>bob has said 'Go look at Zodiark', then since then has harassed everyone for their opinion on me and deselby, without even posting a case, apart from the aforementioned \"Look at him\" and , against deselby, saying \"I don't like how deselby is reacting to my CooLskins vote\" and \"You've outed yourself as scum lolololol\". Yet, despite these \"cases\", you decided to pointlessly wagon Hrezs when the wagon against him hit full steam. Seriously, your last post is the closest you have come to providing any reason for voting, and its not even a reason.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">UNVOTE<br>Vote: bobsnox</span></div></blockquote><br><br>We're now voting for the next major wagon. So after saying in no uncertain terms that celi was scum, Zodiark unvotes him and vote for the biggest wagon. Then <span style=\"font-style: italic\">in his very next post</span> he unvotes <span style=\"font-style: italic\">again</span> and votes for the new biggest wagon. To paraphrase: \"If Zodiark isn't scum, then I need to relearn how to scumhunt.\"<br><br>ARG!!! This theme makes my eyes bleed!</div></blockquote><br><br>Oh, and he also instantly jumped onto bobsnox after his scumbud came in and made a crap case against bobs. That's interesting because it was the first time Zodiark voted for somebody who wasn't the lead wagon at the time, but that was only because Zodiark himself was the lead wagon."}

And now that we know he did track one scum, racking 2 scum is not that unlikely either. I think I can see your point, but I don\u2019t think it is as significant as you seem to think.

And why is someone who made 5 posts early in the game the basis for thinking I am worth a vote?  What did kondi do that was so scummy and did antihero do anything to add to those suspicions?"}

So yeah I did make a contradiction, but top earlier then bottom... Now to more meaty stuff in this section of your post... [/quote]<br>Your case is bullshit because it never quotes any of the two (parama and bob) you are talking about. Without a quote we have no reference to what we are talking about, you could (and in some cases probably are) misrepresenting them at some point. We can't even be sure that they said the things that you say they are saying. It also doesn't help that the whole top paragraph is speculative/wifom which contributes little to nothing to your apparent bob suspicion (ohh, you mean the guy who flipped town tracker? Oh yeah him.).<br><br>The bottom part is still speculation, and not really that logial at all. As a tracker you track your scummiest read to see if they kill. However, if that player is in fact scum and know that he is taking a lot of heat then one of his buddies will take the kill instead. In ine of my last scum games we knew that there was a tracker/watcher combo, we debated to the end of the night deadline who would submit the kill. Odly enough the tracker actually tracked one of my scum buddies. While bob is speculating about scum actions he is a tracker. Its almost his job to make an educated guess at who will submit the kill so that he can track that person to it.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>don wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>skins wrote:</cite>[goodposting=\"parama\"]<blockquote><div><cite>Parama wrote:</cite>Bwahahaha, dj's definitely the scum neighbor. \"I think bobsnox is scum, and I think Parama is scum by association, so let me lynch the player who I feel is scum by association instead of the one who I feel is scum for actual reasons.\"<br>At least the Zodiark wagon's the leading wagon again <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"></div></blockquote>[/goodposting]<br>This is exactly what I'm thinking by reading his posts.

That's kinda the point at looking at your posts to find your true intention/motivation/stance.

You see if you happened to be in the majority of people that think bob was town (revelation: he was!!!!!!) then you don't go wifom speculating about who is the scum tracker and the like.

That's kinda the point at looking at your posts to find your true intention/motivation/stance.

But, looking more at AH and havingfitz's interactions with Zodiark as per havingfitz's request, I see AntiHero was first to point out Zodiark's contradiction, which led to the wagon on him. But, if this was bussing, agreed in advance, then havingfitz would have stuck with AntiHero's scum-read on Zodiark when he replaced in, rather than weakening. <br><br>Hmm. I think I might have tunnelled too hard on kondi because of my anger about the D1 let's-lynch-the-claimed-vig epic fail (and yes it was, even if he wouldn't play ball and let his kill be directed).

Saying \"what a stupid kill\" with the implication that he would not have made that kill and therefore isn't scum. Furthermore, the fact that CooLskins says that bob was obvious town is a good enough motive for the kill, coupled with bob being a tracker seems like a good reason to kill from his eyes.

Scum make up the excuse because if they don't make an excuse then they think they'll be lynched for it. I'm not sure if DJ picked up on this or not, but \"his post was adequate\" implies that Cele met the criteria DJ was looking for, even though it's obvious that Cele intentionally refused to meet this criteria.<br>Sorry if that sounds horribly convoluted, I'm not in a wordsmith-type mood today it seems.<br><blockquote><div><cite>don_johnson wrote:</cite>Why?

So there was more thought to your vote than just \"being on both mislynches and off the scum lynch\". Well there is nothing much I can say in defense of your suspicions except for the reason I voted Beck is similar in nature to other D1 votes I place, but that is as scum or town so no alignment indication there. I poke and prod during D1 unless something is obviously scum motivated from my point of view. As for Hzres, I thought my motivation was pretty clear.

It didn't stop you from placing and maintaining your vote on bobsnox when he was outted/claimed tracker.  This is a contradiction on your part.  You make it seem like you would have removed the vote on Back if you had been around after he had claimed but you fail to do the same thing after bobsnox's claim and instead stay on his wagon while remaining off the equally prominent (and accurate) Zodiark wagon.</div></blockquote>There is a world of difference between voting someone who is a claimed vig and someone who is a claimed tracker, and to suggest otherwise is absurd. Not only is tracker much more likely to be a scum role compared to a vig; but vig is marginally testable. AND, most importantly, was the behavior bobnox surrounding his claim and clearing/semi-clearing people based on his no results. We saw how well that worked with Zodiark being cleared/semi-cleared so my suspicion was sound."}

Interesting looking back how he said he \"didn't really notice Zodiark\" when Zodiark was the leading wagon. And yet he noticed Bobs who hadn't really done much up until the case was made against him.

Speaking of making shit up, I never said this, \"didn't really notice Zodiark.\"  Are you that _____ to completely fabricate a quote in order to substantiate suspicions on someone?  Your comments re: bob are ridiculous...I noticed him because he was the scummiest player IMO until I reconsidered his claim.  And why is someone who made 5 posts early in the game the basis for thinking I am worth a vote?  What did kondi do that was so scummy and did antihero do anything to add to those suspicions?</div></blockquote><br><br>Wow, you totally misunderstood everything I said there, bucko. Bobsnox was the confirmed town that I was referring to. You made a crap case on a now-confirmed town (bobsnox) simply to protect your scumbud (Zodiark).

I think my points against them are reasonable, and the L-1 vote on Beck is clearly worse than the xvart's on the hrezs wagon. But, looking more at AH and havingfitz's interactions with Zodiark as per havingfitz's request, I see AntiHero was first to point out Zodiark's contradiction, which led to the wagon on him. But, if this was bussing, agreed in advance, then havingfitz would have stuck with AntiHero's scum-read on Zodiark when he replaced in, rather than weakening.[/quote]<br><br>I disagree completely. Antihero spent most of his time attacking Celiboski, who was an easy scumtarget for a mislynch becaue of the hammer. Also, he didn't push Zodiark much at all, and he only mentioned the slip in passing. I don't think that bit is enough to dismiss the otherwise very strong case against the fitz player slot.<br><br>-Bub"}

Don and I are either neighbors OR we are both scum fake claiming neighbors. For the sake of argument, I'm going to eliminate us being scum fake claiming because it is ridiculous and I know it isn't the case, so that leaves us as neighbors. If you want to make the argument that we are both scum go ahead, but from your posting I don't think you believe this to be the case. So that leaves don and me as neighbors.

CooLskins talks about the \"very strong case against the fitz player slot\" in post 601, but he's voting don_johnson: this fits with the 'put buddy in #2 slot, vote townie' approach to being scum, if don's town. Earlier, he FoSes kondi while voting don (iso15), and does an \"I think kondi's scummiest but Bub thinks don's scummiest so we're voting don\" split read thing in iso16. The main difficulty is it would mean he's bussing both his buddies when he calls Zodiark and havingfitz scumbuddies in iso48. But then, he still pushes harder for a don lynch today, so it's possible they're buddies looking from this direction. <br><br>havingfitz doesn't comment on CooLskins at all until iso9, where he has a little tirade against him. And then, calm again in iso10. I think the end of iso9 could be scum distancing. The 'his posts are scummy but I think he's town' line he takes in iso13 is convenient for giving him an excuse if CooLskins flips scum (\"well I did say his posts were scummy\"), as does tying his town read to a scum read on xvart (\"I did say skins is scum if xvart's town, I just didn't think xvart is town\"). AntiHero and kondi don't interact with or give reads on CooLskins at all. It's plausible they're buddies looking from this direction. <br><br><br>Ooh, another important point I just noticed about havingfitz, separate to xvart's point about his vote hop, but based on the same post:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>fitz 586 wrote:</cite>don scum will point to dselby IMO.</div></blockquote><br><br>This theory comes despite the \"xvart town = skins scum\" line in iso12 and \"xvart town = Parama or CooLskins scum\" in iso15. If don's scum, that means xvart's town, yet fitz doesn't mention these previous conditional theories of his. This contradiction just shows he's trying to draw links between everyone. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote, vote: havingfitz</span><br><br>Explain why you say don scum points to deselby scum, when you also say xvart town points to CooLskins (or Parama) scum. <br><br><br><br>Post 599 where don defends CooLskins makes me further inclined to believe don's town.

The timing and development of the contradiction is such that there is a high likelihood that it is scum motivated. It wasn't some side comment and contradiction independent of a main bandwagon or growing bandwagon. It is a focal point of someone who flipped scum.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: havingfitz</span> L-1"}

A game just finished where both D1 and D2 the competing wagons were both scum and this logic almost cleared me when I replaced in. While I personally didn't have a solid scum read on don yesterday compared to CooLskins, I was cognizant of the things people were saying yesterday. I think the fact that both of us are alive today indicates strongly that don could possibly be scum. If you think about it, if we both were town one of us should have died last night to push the whole \"one neighbor must be scum\" idea and lead the town into game over. If don is scum they couldn't kill me because of the heat don was getting yesterday as he would be an auto lynch. <br><br>In our neighbor QT last night I posted that CooLskins must die tomorrow (today) due to everything I said yesterday plus that super scummy hammer without even asking for a claim. I also posted that I had a town read on don even though that wasn't exactly true to see if I could fish out some information prior to day beginning pending the night kill cementing my read on him either way. I closed the first post of the night by saying that I wouldn't be shocked if one of us was killed during night to put the town in a LYLO situation tomorrow forcing the other neighbor to be lynched. <br><br>Don said he concurred with the CooLskins hammer being awful and said he had a null read on deselby and that imagine was town. I agreed with his assessment on Imagine and then dropped how mad I would be for not pushing CooLskins and Parama harder the first two days if they turned out to be the scum team. Don came back and said the Parama connection to CooLskins should be clear if CooLskins flips scum. Then says he is hesitant about Parama being scum in this game state. He said he hopes we both survive the night as we are stronger as a unified front. The wishes me good luck. <br><br>Based on everything that happened yesterday with the don wagon I would be the obvious NK if don was town. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Parama wrote:</cite>This game is the trainwreck that never should've been &lt;.&lt;</div></blockquote><br>lol. You said this would happen <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3143866#p3143866\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>.<br><br>CooLskins' haphazard vote today looks like the ultimate fake \"I'm convinced because I know I'm right because I'm scum\" vote, and it is so cavalier considering we are in LYLO like he knows scum can't quickhammer. If don and CooLskins are scum they knew I was going to be gunning for CooLskins and they knew that don was also going to come out strong against them today, too. Since they both were under fire yesterday I suspect they are setting up a 1v1 with them knowing what I said in the neighbor QT so when one flips they buy town cred.<br><br>CooLskins - is there a reason you didn't ask for a claim yesterday when we weren't close to a deadline?<br><br>I am confident that CooLskins and don are the remaining scum."}

The fact that don claimed first made him less likely to be scum, as scum would prefer killing the neighbor before anyone could make the connection.  I do not think the problem here relied on neighbors.  Scum's actions were mainly decided by the PR info they got n1 so they pretty much had an optimal night strategy which they followed.  Town's problem ran along the lines of most town players being scummy, impatient and those who were pro-town enough and stopped to think before acting didn't take an active role in stopping all the madness that ensued.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>from HP's old setup creation notes wrote:</cite>The last choice is just playing the old neighbor WIFOM having 4 townies and 2 town neighbors (unconfirmed alignment).
