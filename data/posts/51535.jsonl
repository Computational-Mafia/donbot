So first I find neil's fast unvote on NS to be strange. I don't see a reason to unvote so fast a little pressure won't hurt and that's why I found this more like if you are trying not to start a wagon on NS. Not to mention that you are just switching your votes one after another and this kinda makes your vote with no weight.<br>Next is QM. This guy is acting like super strange. First at the start he has a more trolling attitude and suddenly when he got some votes on him he got like super serious. That switch of feelings and his vote on NS which was without any explanation is looking just odd. Also I don't find any logic in NS's wagon. Varsoon started this wagon and I thoght it was a joke and I think that because he never said anywhere that he is voting NS to achieve certain information from him and that's why I find this whole wagon silly so I would like to ask Varsoon if he is really trying to get some information or not.<br>Titus'ses vote is both scummy and townie. First if he doesn't want to choose a side in this he might just wanna try to make the wagons even and I understand that. But I don't understand if he is hesitating why does he vote at all? <br>Ninja is maybe the only player here who leans town to me. He has a explanation for every move of his, he explains his votes and I also think he is trying to scum hunt properly. I would need some more time to form an opinion for the others. I would also like to see more from NS because I am hesitating about him and his \"I want to skip the day 1 post\". I also don't see any reasoning behind his votes.<br><br>I would also like to do one more thing:<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Anatole Kuragin</span><br>I would like to get my vote back and just see how this all develops."}

Now that he has receive some pressure, QM has also switched votes twice seemingly without much thought to it. Fortunately, the votes got him to post some decent points though I really dislike how much he is propping up Varsoon with meta game. Two town reads he made that I agree with are titus and gameplay - I agree that both players seem a little green/confused rather than intentionally misleading or malicious. He also mentioned that Lootifer was acting weird with his question that basically comprised his only activity until voting for QM. This definitely makes me more leery of Lootifer (and to a small degree, the lynch mob on QM that I am a part of) and I wish he would say more.<br><br>bjc, I don't see the value in the case against rofl. He came off kinda dickish in his comments, but not necessarily scummy to me. I actually agree with his comments about getting past the meaningless chatter, especially because at that point there was actually an event of substance going on - the NS lynch mob. That said, your explanation of the vote against him was kind of vague and seems predicated on your own scumhunting formula that I'm clearly not privy to. Even more suspicious of this lynch because in his big post QM lists his scum reads and rofl isn't among them, yet he quickly switches to vote rofl on a whim (after switching to ice a few posts prior).<br><br><br>Same reasoning for the case against ICE - \"quoted post feels off\" isn't exactly an objective analysis that I can examine and agree/disagree with.<br><br>Also, I think a big issue this game is people relying on metadata that's very clearly unsound.

I really don't have much free time and computer access but I will try to catch up. I saw the wagons which are formed so far and I will say some of my thoughts about them:<br><br>1. The NS wagon - I didn't get why people jumped on that wagon and I didn't saw somebody explaining anything either but now I am not so skeptic about this wagon. I don't like the way he is lurking all this time, the way he is just switching his votes when he sees that a wagon is gaining speed and how he doesn't give any explanation behind those votes. I have a feeling that scum wouldn't act like that and give himself away so obviously but it may be reverse psychology. With that said I partly agree with this wagon so don't be surprised if join it.<br>2. The QM wagon - as I said earlier he was acting trolly and he suddenly switched his feelings just the opposite. But now after he got some pressure on him he is making some good posts and I think I see some thought progress (town) behind his posts and I think he is trying to prove he can be useful. He is more leaning town to me than scum. That's why this won't be the wagon I will join.<br>3. The Titus wagon - this girl is just being like super aggressive. I don't see how acting like this will help you with anything and you seem just desperate to prove you are \"cool\" with the votes on you. But I won't make a vote on a attitude basis so this won't be the wagon I will join.<br>4. The Roflcopter wagon - From the start I had a feeling about him but I try to go mainly with my logic not with my gut feeling so I decided not to mention it. I have some things that I don't like in his posts and I will share them with you:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>qm's recent posting only makes me like my vote more</div></blockquote><br>Can you please explain me this? I don't like how you just throw something without any explanation and it makes me think that you don't really have one.<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>ice is town despite his misgivings about verbiage</div></blockquote><br>This was really strange and it is so because it is really odd for a townie to be sure in someone. How can you be sure of anyone's alignment if you are a townie? That suggest to me that you can have so other information or more specifically knowing who are the scum.<br> <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>gameplay keeps pinging my scumdar too.</div></blockquote><br>Yep again a post without any solid explanation, you just throw something like that hoping somebody can grab the opportunity and just distract the suspicions around you elsewhere. Who can that somebody be I can just guess.<br><br>Well it is more than obvious who I will vote for and so without any further delay <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Roflcopter</span>."}

I really don't have much free time and computer access but I will try to catch up. I saw the wagons which are formed so far and I will say some of my thoughts about them:<br><br>1. The NS wagon - I didn't get why people jumped on that wagon and I didn't saw somebody explaining anything either but now I am not so skeptic about this wagon. I don't like the way he is lurking all this time, the way he is just switching his votes when he sees that a wagon is gaining speed and how he doesn't give any explanation behind those votes. I have a feeling that scum wouldn't act like that and give himself away so obviously but it may be reverse psychology. With that said I partly agree with this wagon so don't be surprised if join it.<br>2. The QM wagon - as I said earlier he was acting trolly and he suddenly switched his feelings just the opposite. But now after he got some pressure on him he is making some good posts and I think I see some thought progress (town) behind his posts and I think he is trying to prove he can be useful. He is more leaning town to me than scum. That's why this won't be the wagon I will join.<br>3. The Titus wagon - this girl is just being like super aggressive. I don't see how acting like this will help you with anything and you seem just desperate to prove you are \"cool\" with the votes on you. But I won't make a vote on a attitude basis so this won't be the wagon I will join.<br>4. The Roflcopter wagon - From the start I had a feeling about him but I try to go mainly with my logic not with my gut feeling so I decided not to mention it. I have some things that I don't like in his posts and I will share them with you:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>qm's recent posting only makes me like my vote more</div></blockquote><br>Can you please explain me this? I don't like how you just throw something without any explanation and it makes me think that you don't really have one.<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>ice is town despite his misgivings about verbiage</div></blockquote><br>This was really strange and it is so because it is really odd for a townie to be sure in someone. How can you be sure of anyone's alignment if you are a townie? That suggest to me that you can have so other information or more specifically knowing who are the scum.<br> <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>gameplay keeps pinging my scumdar too.</div></blockquote><br>Yep again a post without any solid explanation, you just throw something like that hoping somebody can grab the opportunity and just distract the suspicions around you elsewhere. Who can that somebody be I can just guess.<br><br>Well it is more than obvious who I will vote for and so without any further delay <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Roflcopter</span>.</div></blockquote><br><br>A lot of the discussion the past day or so has been pretty much dead end freshman psychology major analysis of whether people are being scummy are not. Now joins probably the most promising lynchmob (Roflcopter). He accuses him of posting without solid explanation, yet the above quotes and their responses are the closest gameplay has come to any useful analysis/explanation.<br><br>Can we all agree to some extent that the above post is possibly the most middle-of-the-road and least useful post all game? Gameplay basically says he agrees and doesn't agree with each of four wagons, with lots of mentions of his feelings and the behaviors of the accused, rather than logical cases.<br><br>I previously got a town read from gameplay and gave him the benefit of the doubt, but I'm getting much more of a useful/innocent read from QM now than I am from gameplay. <br><br>This is his only other real post of note: <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>It's too early for me to do a read on every player here but yes, I do have some observations and I will start with the earliest ones. So first I find neil's fast unvote on NS to be strange. I don't see a reason to unvote so fast a little pressure won't hurt and that's why I found this more like if you are trying not to start a wagon on NS. Not to mention that you are just switching your votes one after another and this kinda makes your vote with no weight.<br>Next is QM. This guy is acting like super strange. First at the start he has a more trolling attitude and suddenly when he got some votes on him he got like super serious. That switch of feelings and his vote on NS which was without any explanation is looking just odd. Also I don't find any logic in NS's wagon. Varsoon started this wagon and I thoght it was a joke and I think that because he never said anywhere that he is voting NS to achieve certain information from him and that's why I find this whole wagon silly so I would like to ask Varsoon if he is really trying to get some information or not.<br>Titus'ses vote is both scummy and townie. First if he doesn't want to choose a side in this he might just wanna try to make the wagons even and I understand that. But I don't understand if he is hesitating why does he vote at all? <br>Ninja is maybe the only player here who leans town to me. He has a explanation for every move of his, he explains his votes and I also think he is trying to scum hunt properly. I would need some more time to form an opinion for the others. I would also like to see more from NS because I am hesitating about him and his \"I want to skip the day 1 post\". I also don't see any reasoning behind his votes.</div></blockquote><br><br>Again, frequently says players are both scummy AND towny without any solid scum reads. It feels like he is opening himself up to vote on any lynchmob while trying to make it look like he is contributing by doing almost entirely feeling and behavioral analysis that falls flat. <br><br>My initial read of gameplay was that he was just a green town, but I think there is more damning evidence in these two quoted posts than any of the other cases made so far. BJC and Varsoon are trying to lynch people based on meta and super secret scum tell analysis, which is fine if that works for you, I guess, but gameplay is exhibiting very wishy washy, opportunistic behavior which makes him a safer choice for scum.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: QM</span> <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: gameplay506</span>"}

Yoshi is right, it\u2019s dangerous and not enough of a payoff. I mainly don\u2019t think Yoshi is scum at this point because he\u2019s voting my other heavy scumread. I think a flip in either Ice or Rofl\u2019s direction can help clarify what Yoshi is.<br><br>@Yoshi: I feel like Gameplay\u2019s fence-sitting and such is due to being quite new and unsure of things, because he seems like he\u2019s trying to contribute, but not in a \u201cHopefully I can contribute and not seem scummy\u201d kind of way.<br><br>@Anatole: No, I don\u2019t think Gameplay\u2019s non-RVS posts are most useless.

I use meta very minimally, and the only reason I mentioned that at all is because of how recent the last game was.

I believe I had seen Varsoon point out that his anti-RVS vote became a real vote based on reactions and liked it before I saw rofl posting multiple bad posts.<br><blockquote><div><cite>bjc wrote:</cite>Yeah it is definitely easier to say someone dropped a town tell when youre scum, I think we all know that.<br></div></blockquote><br>I honestly have no idea where you get this. Scum want to leave their reads as open to interpretation as possible so they can switch if there's a good reason to wagon a strong player. In fact, you encourage Antihero in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5884849#p5884849\">170</a> who calls rofl out for being hedgey when giving town reads.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5883016#p5883016\">133</a> by gameplay was decent. (WRITTEN LATER) A lot of people are hating on this post and I don't see it. He gave his opinions on the wagons and joined arguably the best one for good reasoning. I did, however, miss him calling someone both scum and town in one post earlier on. That is indeed scummy.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Blue Yoshi wrote:</cite>You have ICEninja scum pushing Titus town.<br>I've seen manipulation like this before, even in real life.

I'm not saying anything about the alignment I'm saying I feel like the person itself feels different. The Titus that is playing in this game is not the Titus that was playing in my linked game, and it would take more than a difference in alignment to account for that change. That is why I don't know what to make of it.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>bjc wrote:</cite>There's not enough info for a decision to be made, but that's also why I want to keep pushing ROFL and ICE needs to answer my questions..<br></div></blockquote><br>Jesus Christ man, its Mother's Day.

Looking through the thread, pretty much everything I have against him (and more) has been pointed out.<br><br>I don't really put a huge amount of stock in to his early encouragement of non-discussion with the novel talk, but whatever. Things get scummier in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5879683#p5879683\">76</a> where he makes this long statement:<br><blockquote><div><cite>gameplay wrote:</cite>Next is QM.

First at the start he has a more trolling attitude and suddenly when he got some votes on him he got like super serious.

You should be able to get an idea of what I'm pointing out here. He's making statements about things and calling them odd and silly and a joke, but never saying anything about how he feels it impacts alignment. Some info without analysis is fine, but look at the rest of the post. The ONLY actual stance he gives is a slight townread of me which, considering how ridiculous my first vote of the game was, makes little sense. The only reason I can see someone wanting to give me a town read at that point in the game was to buddy up against someone who looks potentially dangerous. This read is <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">especially problematic</span> because of this gem, which I missed my first time around in response to someone else calling me town:<br><blockquote><div><cite>gameplay wrote:</cite><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>ice is town despite his misgivings about verbiage</div></blockquote><br>This was really strange and it is so because it is really odd for a townie to be sure in someone. How can you be sure of anyone's alignment if you are a townie? That suggest to me that you can have so other information or more specifically knowing who are the scum.<br></div></blockquote><br>This was stated only a few ISO posts after giving me a town read. He is clearly not remembering his own reads, because they are fabricated. Now I did indeed like that post my first readthrough, but the more I'm looking at it he keeps using the verbage \"this looks strange\" etc. and not actually calling anything scummy. In my quoted paragraph he used BOTH \"strange\" and \"odd\" in one sentence. When called out about his reasoning for a rofl vote, he has nothing despite many posts indicating that he feels strongly about roflscum.<br><br>All the sudden pressure is on him and bam, Titus is obvscum along with AtE to get out of pressure.<br><br>Scum."}

So first I know I have played only one game but that doesn't mean I will be so stupid if I were scum lol. I will tell you just that I wouldn't go into such fights ( like the one with Titus) and I also knew people will scum read me because of my posts. I may be a newbie but I'm not retarded duh. Secondly this is my first mini game and my second game on this site overall. I decided that I wouldn't make pointless cases on day 1 just because there are a lot more experienced players that I can follow which are better in scum hunting, cases, etc. You can judge me for this if you wan't but I think this was for the best. I also don't really have the experience nor skill required for this game ( no town pr, so it's all skill)  so that's why I won't really be angry if you lynch me. After all, most of you here don't like my posts and for you they aren't good so I probably will be useless later on in this game. But there is one thing you are wrong about - I am not scum. I don't really care if you are going to lynch me or not because I am just a townie and I don't have anything to lose but if you really want to lynch scum on day 1 you have to search it elsewhere. I know you won't believe me and will just scum read me more but I had to say."}

My only excuse (and its not a very good one) is in my next point<br>- My slackness has come from struggling to engage in this game. I am not very good at d1 mafia, plain and simple; add in mountainous (with a 2:11 ratio) and well im feeling pretty useless right now. <br>- Last but not least I find it interesting that no one other than bjc has taken an interest in me. Sure my absence has been noted but no one has really got on board with bjc. That makes me think that one of our little scum friends hasn't had stellar activity either; that or they are experienced enough to know that jumping on the flake right now could backfire (especially if they have better mislynches lined up). The former is more likely in a scum-gameplay scenario, the latter more likely in a town-gameplay scenario.<br><br>Probably gonna vote gameplay, but want to see thoughts on his AtE first. (yup being equivocal, but I am a serial fence-sitter and feel it's entirely justifiable: if you could be sure of anything this game wouldn't exist)."}

I'll love to prove you wrong if you can. It's not exactly hard to do to show you being pro-active in other games and show how you were being lazy here...

I'm fairly certain my accusations have been following the same consistent path. Again, I'd love to see your evidence here.

Not to mention his early unvote on NS in the beginning which seemed to me like he was searching for an excuse to save his vote for other wagons. And then comes his best vote till now - Varsoon's. Yep to me he is just jumping on another easy target so I won't be surprised if town sheeps again ( with the help of his buddy of course)...<br><br>Yep Blue I hope that answers your question... <br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Neil</span><br><br>sooo:<br>Loot what info would you get from my lynch when I flipped town?<br>Rofl why did you scum read me in the beginning, unvote me, then scum read me again and vote me again and now you town read me? Ugh I think you might be neil's partner.<br>ICE you are the same as ROFL. At one point in the game you were just so eager to lynch me but still you unvoted me. I actually don't find this scummy because you could of just waited for someone to hammer.</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm going to TL:DR your post because let's face it, it's mostly fluff.<br><br>After WIFOMING the hell out of this post, your case is that I:<br><br>#1. Flattered Titus.<br>#2. Voted for you for no reason.<br>#3. Took my vote off of Nobody Special during the RVS stage.<br>#4. I voted Varsoon.<br><br>Then after voting me, not only do you completely ignore me with your bunches of questions that you asked everyone, but you leave me with nothing but WIFOM to respond too. Let me just say, I won't participate in that useless discussion of WIFOM. As for your case:<br><br>#1. What lol? This makes me scum, how? Buddying? Because you conveniently managed to leave out the pressure and vote I put on Titus, plus the pressure I'm <span class=\"noboldsig\">still currently pushing Titus with.</span> If that's buddying, I'm doing it wrong.<br>#2. Actually I quoted you the post before I voted, and while I didn't explain how your push on ROFL was incredibly weak and scum-telling, I showed it through my summary of your response. So actually, I voted you for a damn good reason.<br>#3. This is so incredibly invalid, it's not even funny. Explain to me how voting / unvoting <span class=\"noboldsig\">during RVS</span> is scummy?<br>#4. Again, explain to me how A. Varsoon is an easy lynch and B. Why voting him is scummy? (Especially when I was the first person to vote him, considering nobody else had...)<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5892827#p5892827\" class=\"postlink\">post 323</a>, bjc wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5892691#p5892691\" class=\"postlink\">post 311</a>, roflcopter wrote:</cite>updated town list: neil, titus, nobody special, anatole, gameplay</div></blockquote><br> <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_facepalm.gif\" alt=\":facepalm:\" title=\"Face, Meet Palm\"> <br><br>Basically, anyone that hasn't really pushed ROFL is town. lol, and the reasons you laid out for them being town are quite.. shit.<br><br>And that's all you can provide?</div></blockquote><br><br>I can kind of agree with this, I'd like to know why the others are town in your opinion.

There are somethings that are just flat out wrong, as Varsoon is NEVER an easy lynch. However, calling it fluff is ridiculous.

His first post including actual content doesn't come until his 10th post on page 3, long after people have actually started to make active contributions in game. Also, said post pointed out all very important stuff but included zero analysis of anything. Pointing out that someone is lurking, pointing out that someone didn't include reasoning for a vote, etc. is great, but he didn't state that anything pinged his scumdar. This gives an early bad impression, as he's got a high word count without much in the way of anything used to read off of him. Definitely benefits scum for the early section.<br><br>Later on page 3, his content picks up though. He also explains his lack of recent experience with forum based mafia, which explains a slow start. His post quality continues to improve, and he impresses me particularly with his thoughts in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5878395#p5878395\">58</a>. He seems to do a very good job of looking at things without confirmation bias. He gives convincing reasons for his votes, despite saying a few things I disagree with, and has been leaning town for a decent while. I'm slightly concerned with how quickly he switched his vote to Lootifer, but it seems like Loot will end up being the \"compromise\" lynch anyway, as it seems like everyone has at least a mild scumread on him.<br><br>Leaning town.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Antihero:</span> This guy has contributed almost nothing. He throws down a random looking vote on page 7, which I never consider a town aligned thing to do. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5886144#p5886144\">182</a> bugs me since I was also off the site for a little while and bjc was badgering me to respond to his posts. His vote on me is crap and his calling my votes \"hilarious bad\" is also crap.<br><br>I don't really see a lot to indicate alignment, just a lot of uselessness.<br><br>Anti-town, but impossible to determine alignment.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">bjc:</span> This guy arguably has the most content of any player. He's spent the entire day with confirmation bias about me being scum. Basically from one post feeling \"off\" to him, he's been focusing pretty heavily on me on and off for at least half of this game. To his credit, he hasn't been tunneling on me. With several posts worth of scum hunting towards Loot and rofl, and being crystal clear about his town reads, I don't see very much that could suggest this guy is anything but determined to lynch scum, despite being misguided about me.<br><br>As solid of a town read as I could have for day 1.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Blue Yoshi:</span> Oh look, another low content player who wants to lynch me. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5883424#p5883424\">143</a> makes ABSOLUTELY no sense, considering I was saying how Titus was dramatically different this game from the town game she and I had played together, I don't even understand how someone could construe this as me \"pushing town Titus\". Much of the rest of his posting is \"I don't really want to read this game\". He has kept his vote on me because apparently I'm being passive aggressive, which once again makes absolutely no sense.<br><br>He is either scum trying to stay under the radar or is town who needs to replace out of this game. Not sure which.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Gameplay506:</span> We have a high post count player, but arguably not that high of a content poster. More than anyone, I feel like I've been fairly clear about my opinions of gameplay. For reasons that both I and others have pointed out, he seemed extremely scummy. His defeatism, however, makes no sense whatsoever in a daytalk game unless his scum buddy is absent from it. So either he's scum with someone like Antihero or Blue Yoshi or he's town that needs to not just fucking give up when times get hard. If we lynch scum who proved to be inactive during gameplay's defeatist shit then I'll be more than happy to lynch this guy, but unless that happens I don't like him for scum.<br><br>Town, pending a scum flip who was inactive at a specific point in this game.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Titus:</span> The early game seems to be largely spent on getting discussion going, and being willing to do controversial things to do it. This is something I explicitly do as town, and like it. The difference in play from such a recent game confused me, but has since been squared away so I'm not so worried about that. Titus is probably tied with bjc in terms of active content and scum hunting, and comes off as extremely unbiased and hasn't shown much in the way of tunnel vision. While like Varsoon and bjc I have to be careful about having an excessively strong town bias, I don't see any reason for Titus to be scum at this point.<br><br>Looking town."}

His first post including actual content doesn't come until his 10th post on page 3, long after people have actually started to make active contributions in game. Also, said post pointed out all very important stuff but included zero analysis of anything. Pointing out that someone is lurking, pointing out that someone didn't include reasoning for a vote, etc. is great, but he didn't state that anything pinged his scumdar. This gives an early bad impression, as he's got a high word count without much in the way of anything used to read off of him. Definitely benefits scum for the early section.<br><br>Later on page 3, his content picks up though. He also explains his lack of recent experience with forum based mafia, which explains a slow start. His post quality continues to improve, and he impresses me particularly with his thoughts in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5878395#p5878395\">58</a>. He seems to do a very good job of looking at things without confirmation bias. He gives convincing reasons for his votes, despite saying a few things I disagree with, and has been leaning town for a decent while. I'm slightly concerned with how quickly he switched his vote to Lootifer, but it seems like Loot will end up being the \"compromise\" lynch anyway, as it seems like everyone has at least a mild scumread on him.<br><br>Leaning town.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Antihero:</span> This guy has contributed almost nothing. He throws down a random looking vote on page 7, which I never consider a town aligned thing to do. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5886144#p5886144\">182</a> bugs me since I was also off the site for a little while and bjc was badgering me to respond to his posts.

He's spent the entire day with confirmation bias about me being scum. Basically from one post feeling \"off\" to him, he's been focusing pretty heavily on me on and off for at least half of this game. To his credit, he hasn't been tunneling on me. With several posts worth of scum hunting towards Loot and rofl, and being crystal clear about his town reads, I don't see very much that could suggest this guy is anything but determined to lynch scum, despite being misguided about me.<br><br>As solid of a town read as I could have for day 1.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Blue Yoshi:</span> Oh look, another low content player who wants to lynch me. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5883424#p5883424\">143</a> makes ABSOLUTELY no sense, considering I was saying how Titus was dramatically different this game from the town game she and I had played together, I don't even understand how someone could construe this as me \"pushing town Titus\". Much of the rest of his posting is \"I don't really want to read this game\". He has kept his vote on me because apparently I'm being passive aggressive, which once again makes absolutely no sense.<br><br>He is either scum trying to stay under the radar or is town who needs to replace out of this game.

More than anyone, I feel like I've been fairly clear about my opinions of gameplay. For reasons that both I and others have pointed out, he seemed extremely scummy. His defeatism, however, makes no sense whatsoever in a daytalk game unless his scum buddy is absent from it. So either he's scum with someone like Antihero or Blue Yoshi or he's town that needs to not just fucking give up when times get hard. If we lynch scum who proved to be inactive during gameplay's defeatist shit then I'll be more than happy to lynch this guy, but unless that happens I don't like him for scum.<br><br>Town, pending a scum flip who was inactive at a specific point in this game.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Titus:</span> The early game seems to be largely spent on getting discussion going, and being willing to do controversial things to do it. This is something I explicitly do as town, and like it. The difference in play from such a recent game confused me, but has since been squared away so I'm not so worried about that. Titus is probably tied with bjc in terms of active content and scum hunting, and comes off as extremely unbiased and hasn't shown much in the way of tunnel vision. While like Varsoon and bjc I have to be careful about having an excessively strong town bias, I don't see any reason for Titus to be scum at this point.<br><br>Looking town.</div></blockquote><br><br>Antihero, Ugh. This guy isn't posting enough. I wouldn't say anti-town yet. His play is a bit of a flashback to Open 529 hosted by Nobody Special. Defenitely something to watch if the similarities continue.<br><br>Anatole, this guy is my biggest townread. I seem to be agreeing with him a lot which is good for day 1. I will have to watch him but I'll bet he's town for now.<br><br>bjc, his aggression reads a little awkward but is definitely protown in his contributions. Town for now, but I can't get that feeling that says OMG he is town.<br><br>Blue Yoshi, I'm leaning scum here. All he's done is bitch that the game isn't moving and has provided no real effort, saying he doesn't care to. If you don't care to play as town, sub out. There's little reason for demotivational statements and they only help scum. An active and communicating town is a good thing.<br><br>Gameplay, he's new and I can tell. He keeps waffling between playstyles making hard to get a consistent read on him. I'm leaning town because of the fact newb!scum probably wouldn't want to stand out and he's had his moments of contributing new and unique thoughts.<br><br>IceNinja, he seems to be similar to bjc in posting style. They both have a lot of contributions and awkward aggression. It definitely doesn't read as passive aggression, but I can't really understand why IceNinja reacts the way he does. For example, I took off for a few hours and he's upset about the posting not being there. Paranoia is usually considered a towntell, so strong lean town here.<br><br>Neil113 - hyperdefensive and providing little in the way of new thoughts. Whenever someone suspects him, he attacks them. His mood flips on a dime. I don't care for him at all.<br><br>NS, he needs to sub out or post, regardless of alignment.<br><br>rofl - I like rofl as town. He really has a off-way of posting, such as Death's Diner, so I give him a little more slack. Seriously, read his ISO that game. The dude's ISO from that game, if you attached all the sentences end to end, is probably shorter than my posts today combined... and he was town.<br><br>Varsoon - Quiet Varsoon scares me. Active Varsoon scum in Open 512 was caught due to his CCing opponent being obvtown. In See Minus Minus (the sequel to Open 512), Varsoon and I drew scum together. Our strategy there was to let the town divide itself apart. Varsoon's smart and I expect something from him soon. He's just as much of an asset as he is a liability though. We've got to shake Varsoon up somehow to get him out of his zen state."}

That being said, of the little content there is to go on the only thing he said that I disagree with is the part about ICEninjas voteswitch off Gamer being bad.<br><br>-Varsoon is probably town.  Scum dayspeak is a powerful ability, and if he was scum his attitude nullified any utility he could have gotten from it by tunneling on one player for pretty much the entire game.<br><br>-NobodySpecial is just bad.  Also possibly scum.  He has also solidly not lived up to his promise to be more useful during day two so far.<br><br>-I happen to agree with ROFL about Neil.

So I see two benefits of lynching you to be quite honest, #1. You flip town and the people who do think you're scummy because you're lurking will stop using you as a fall back (plus scum will be negated an easy lynch to pursue should someone there be pushed) and #2.

Is it fact that there's one scum in them? No. Stop calling them facts, and instead actually use other things to try to acquit the people on these mislynches if you believe so strongly in it. You can't expect to point that VCA out and ride it all the way through, as town or scum. Locking into PoE is something that lost me most of my games as town, and certainly others have felt the same, and scum love to lock themselves into PoE to minimize work.

Look and see for yourselves, I'm not going to try and take the reigns and lead the town by any means, I don't have enough of me invested into this game to do that to be completely honest. But I will say, two of those three I mentioned are scum. Titus is setting up a mislynch on me, and one of her teammates are biting into it. Don't be deceived."}

In addition to rofl's rebuttal, I would add that Anti has access to this entire thread.  If he were actually convinced that scumhunting in this game is that easy, it makes no sense for him not to actually read the thread and find who was responsible for the PL on lurkers instead of voting the three players on both lynches for no reason.<br><br><br>Regardless, intent to hammer QM unless someone votes Anti ASAP."}

Town knows we only need 2 votes (Ly-Lo) so they'd be much more reserved with their voting right now. The only person that would benefit from pushing a quick lynch right now, is scum. Consider, Anatole could not honestly see me so much more likely to be scum than you Gameplay, that he'd place a vote down because I'm \"confirmed scum\" that he'd be willing to mislynch as town by putting a vote on me. If you're scum, you'd hammer quickly and win. Consider this, how could Anatole really consider you to be so town that he'd be so quick to place a vote down on me? Nobody in this game thought of you as confirmed town and to be quite honest, I wasn't sure who I would vote here, between Anatole and you. Because you're far from confirmed town in my opinion. Considering I don't think Anatole is a VI who would put a vote down ready to end the game so quickly as town, my idea on who to vote leans heavily toward him.<br><br>Seeing as now, if you're scum, you can already win this no matter who you vote, I'll go ahead and <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Anatole</span>. So either you're going to vote and hammer one of us as scum and win, or you're town and you're going to hammer me and lose or Anatole and win the game for us. I haven't followed much the past couple of weeks as IRL stuff has happened (which is why I haven't posted anywhere on this site tbh, it's not just this game that I've been deflecting, which I think you've mentioned before) so I can't make too much of a case on Anatole right now. From what I've seen though, you've been following carefully enough to make your own decision. Read through, figure things out, I'll be here off and on as much as I can to talk with you if you have any questions for me. Don't rush into a decision though. We have plenty of time.<br><br>Something else to consider. You've been against me literally all game. You've jumped down my throat with Titus the literal entire game. If Titus died because \"she knew I was mafia\" as Anatole so kindly pointed out, then how come you're still alive? Why would I leave a supposed \"VI\" who is dead-set against me (and last day phase, sang songs of killing me and promised you'd hang me today) alive in Ly-Lo to vote me? Anybody who was watching or reading through this game, regardless of how much they read, a quick ISO would reveal your vote would be on me during this day phase. How is that smart scum play at all? ROFL was at least somewhat suspicious of myself and Anatole, and not dead-set on me like you were... it'd make more sense for me to kill you today, and claim I was set-up. At least then I'd have a chance. The only person it would benefit having ROFL die more than you is... Anatole.<br><br>So yeah, do your analysis but if your put two and two together, the scum as Anatole makes complete sense, a lot more than just your confbias on me. But you're going to make the decision in the end, and unfortunately I do think you're going to hammer me either as scum or town so I don't see much sense in me trying to sway your opinion. You're either scum, and you're going to win this by hammering me, or you're town and we're going to lose. I'd like you to at least talk it out with me before you hammer me though, if that's okay with you... so at least we have some chance at winning this. If you do hammer me though and not want to talk, good game then.<br><br>P.S. (and kind of off-topic) If you really are a VI, and you are scum, the best play here is to hammer me and win the game FYI. If you're scum and you don't hammer me, I'm going to be seriously pissed and I will black-list you. There's no reason to play against your win-condition and toy with me and Anatole. So if you're scum and you don't hammer myself or Anatole right now, I will not play another game with you on this site."}

That's not difficult to understand. I didn't favor inane questions, nothing was inane about it. I said you were null leaning town, never said you were town to me. You seemed like you were trying, and I was fooled by it for the moment and leaned you toward town, but you were never town to me. I admit I was drawn into the tunnel war with Titus, because Titus was playing that terrible. Town Titus is usually better then that. I was genuinely stunned with Titus' flip. Yes I voted Gameplay because if you've seen throughout the entire game, I was battling rather Gameplay was scum or VI. I still battled with that when this day started, that was until you posted and confirmed yourself as scum anyway.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5998611#p5998611\" class=\"postlink\">post 1271</a>, Anatole Kuragin wrote:</cite>But now that you're alone, suddenly other people have made cases against me and I was scum since day one?

I'm actually impressed that Gameplay made it that far, and also extremely sad. While like I said, there was nothing we could have done to win when you took out ROFL last night, the only reason we were in this position is because we let Gameplay live until Ly-Lo. The loss is truly our fault, but I was exaggerating when I said that the scum didn't deserve their win. You guys did, and that buss on Aegor was perfectly played.
