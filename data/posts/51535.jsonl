So first I find neil's fast unvote on NS to be strange. I don't see a reason to unvote so fast a little pressure won't hurt and that's why I found this more like if you are trying not to start a wagon on NS. Not to mention that you are just switching your votes one after another and this kinda makes your vote with no weight.<br>\nNext is QM. This guy is acting like super strange. First at the start he has a more trolling attitude and suddenly when he got some votes on him he got like super serious. That switch of feelings and his vote on NS which was without any explanation is looking just odd. Also I don't find any logic in NS's wagon. Varsoon started this wagon and I thoght it was a joke and I think that because he never said anywhere that he is voting NS to achieve certain information from him and that's why I find this whole wagon silly so I would like to ask Varsoon if he is really trying to get some information or not.<br>\nTitus'ses vote is both scummy and townie. First if he doesn't want to choose a side in this he might just wanna try to make the wagons even and I understand that. But I don't understand if he is hesitating why does he vote at all? <br>\nNinja is maybe the only player here who leans town to me. He has a explanation for every move of his, he explains his votes and I also think he is trying to scum hunt properly. I would need some more time to form an opinion for the others. I would also like to see more from NS because I am hesitating about him and his \"I want to skip the day 1 post\". I also don't see any reasoning behind his votes.<br>\n<br>\nI would also like to do one more thing:<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Anatole Kuragin</span><br>\nI would like to get my vote back and just see how this all develops.", "time": "Fri May 09, 2014 1:07 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=51535&start=75", "forum": "53", "thread": "51535"}

Now that he has receive some pressure, QM has also switched votes twice seemingly without much thought to it. Fortunately, the votes got him to post some decent points though I really dislike how much he is propping up Varsoon with meta game. Two town reads he made that I agree with are titus and gameplay - I agree that both players seem a little green/confused rather than intentionally misleading or malicious. He also mentioned that Lootifer was acting weird with his question that basically comprised his only activity until voting for QM. This definitely makes me more leery of Lootifer (and to a small degree, the lynch mob on QM that I am a part of) and I wish he would say more.<br>\n<br>\nbjc, I don't see the value in the case against rofl. He came off kinda dickish in his comments, but not necessarily scummy to me. I actually agree with his comments about getting past the meaningless chatter, especially because at that point there was actually an event of substance going on - the NS lynch mob. That said, your explanation of the vote against him was kind of vague and seems predicated on your own scumhunting formula that I'm clearly not privy to. Even more suspicious of this lynch because in his big post QM lists his scum reads and rofl isn't among them, yet he quickly switches to vote rofl on a whim (after switching to ice a few posts prior).<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSame reasoning for the case against ICE - \"quoted post feels off\" isn't exactly an objective analysis that I can examine and agree/disagree with.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I think a big issue this game is people relying on metadata that's very clearly unsound. Can you people accept that sometimes people act differently, sometimes intentionally because they know they might, you know, play another game with you? I'd like to focus on what is going on in the game, voting patterns, etc. rather than how aggressive Varsoon was in a game three months ago or whatever.<br>\n<br>\nTitus is scum because they are frazzled<br>\nTitus is town because they are frazzled", "time": "Fri May 09, 2014 8:02 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=51535&start=100", "forum": "53", "thread": "51535"}

I really don't have much free time and computer access but I will try to catch up. I saw the wagons which are formed so far and I will say some of my thoughts about them:<br>\n<br>\n1. The NS wagon - I didn't get why people jumped on that wagon and I didn't saw somebody explaining anything either but now I am not so skeptic about this wagon. I don't like the way he is lurking all this time, the way he is just switching his votes when he sees that a wagon is gaining speed and how he doesn't give any explanation behind those votes. I have a feeling that scum wouldn't act like that and give himself away so obviously but it may be reverse psychology. With that said I partly agree with this wagon so don't be surprised if join it.<br>\n2. The QM wagon - as I said earlier he was acting trolly and he suddenly switched his feelings just the opposite. But now after he got some pressure on him he is making some good posts and I think I see some thought progress (town) behind his posts and I think he is trying to prove he can be useful. He is more leaning town to me than scum. That's why this won't be the wagon I will join.<br>\n3. The Titus wagon - this girl is just being like super aggressive. I don't see how acting like this will help you with anything and you seem just desperate to prove you are \"cool\" with the votes on you. But I won't make a vote on a attitude basis so this won't be the wagon I will join.<br>\n4. The Roflcopter wagon - From the start I had a feeling about him but I try to go mainly with my logic not with my gut feeling so I decided not to mention it. I have some things that I don't like in his posts and I will share them with you:<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>qm's recent posting only makes me like my vote more</div></blockquote>\nCan you please explain me this? I don't like how you just throw something without any explanation and it makes me think that you don't really have one.\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>ice is town despite his misgivings about verbiage</div></blockquote>\nThis was really strange and it is so because it is really odd for a townie to be sure in someone. How can you be sure of anyone's alignment if you are a townie? That suggest to me that you can have so other information or more specifically knowing who are the scum.\n <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>gameplay keeps pinging my scumdar too.</div></blockquote>\nYep again a post without any solid explanation, you just throw something like that hoping somebody can grab the opportunity and just distract the suspicions around you elsewhere.

I really don't have much free time and computer access but I will try to catch up. I saw the wagons which are formed so far and I will say some of my thoughts about them:<br>\n<br>\n1. The NS wagon - I didn't get why people jumped on that wagon and I didn't saw somebody explaining anything either but now I am not so skeptic about this wagon. I don't like the way he is lurking all this time, the way he is just switching his votes when he sees that a wagon is gaining speed and how he doesn't give any explanation behind those votes. I have a feeling that scum wouldn't act like that and give himself away so obviously but it may be reverse psychology. With that said I partly agree with this wagon so don't be surprised if join it.<br>\n2. The QM wagon - as I said earlier he was acting trolly and he suddenly switched his feelings just the opposite. But now after he got some pressure on him he is making some good posts and I think I see some thought progress (town) behind his posts and I think he is trying to prove he can be useful. He is more leaning town to me than scum. That's why this won't be the wagon I will join.<br>\n3. The Titus wagon - this girl is just being like super aggressive. I don't see how acting like this will help you with anything and you seem just desperate to prove you are \"cool\" with the votes on you. But I won't make a vote on a attitude basis so this won't be the wagon I will join.<br>\n4. The Roflcopter wagon - From the start I had a feeling about him but I try to go mainly with my logic not with my gut feeling so I decided not to mention it. I have some things that I don't like in his posts and I will share them with you:<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>qm's recent posting only makes me like my vote more</div></blockquote>\nCan you please explain me this? I don't like how you just throw something without any explanation and it makes me think that you don't really have one.\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>ice is town despite his misgivings about verbiage</div></blockquote>\nThis was really strange and it is so because it is really odd for a townie to be sure in someone. How can you be sure of anyone's alignment if you are a townie? That suggest to me that you can have so other information or more specifically knowing who are the scum.\n <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>gameplay keeps pinging my scumdar too.</div></blockquote>\nYep again a post without any solid explanation, you just throw something like that hoping somebody can grab the opportunity and just distract the suspicions around you elsewhere. Who can that somebody be I can just guess.<br>\n<br>\nWell it is more than obvious who I will vote for and so without any further delay <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Roflcopter</span>.</div></blockquote>\n\nA lot of the discussion the past day or so has been pretty much dead end freshman psychology major analysis of whether people are being scummy are not. Now joins probably the most promising lynchmob (Roflcopter). He accuses him of posting without solid explanation, yet the above quotes and their responses are the closest gameplay has come to any useful analysis/explanation.<br>\n<br>\nCan we all agree to some extent that the above post is possibly the most middle-of-the-road and least useful post all game? Gameplay basically says he agrees and doesn't agree with each of four wagons, with lots of mentions of his feelings and the behaviors of the accused, rather than logical cases.<br>\n<br>\nI previously got a town read from gameplay and gave him the benefit of the doubt, but I'm getting much more of a useful/innocent read from QM now than I am from gameplay. <br>\n<br>\nThis is his only other real post of note: <br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>It's too early for me to do a read on every player here but yes, I do have some observations and I will start with the earliest ones. So first I find neil's fast unvote on NS to be strange. I don't see a reason to unvote so fast a little pressure won't hurt and that's why I found this more like if you are trying not to start a wagon on NS. Not to mention that you are just switching your votes one after another and this kinda makes your vote with no weight.<br>\nNext is QM. This guy is acting like super strange. First at the start he has a more trolling attitude and suddenly when he got some votes on him he got like super serious. That switch of feelings and his vote on NS which was without any explanation is looking just odd. Also I don't find any logic in NS's wagon. Varsoon started this wagon and I thoght it was a joke and I think that because he never said anywhere that he is voting NS to achieve certain information from him and that's why I find this whole wagon silly so I would like to ask Varsoon if he is really trying to get some information or not.<br>\nTitus'ses vote is both scummy and townie. First if he doesn't want to choose a side in this he might just wanna try to make the wagons even and I understand that. But I don't understand if he is hesitating why does he vote at all? <br>\nNinja is maybe the only player here who leans town to me. He has a explanation for every move of his, he explains his votes and I also think he is trying to scum hunt properly. I would need some more time to form an opinion for the others. I would also like to see more from NS because I am hesitating about him and his \"I want to skip the day 1 post\". I also don't see any reasoning behind his votes.</div></blockquote>\n\nAgain, frequently says players are both scummy AND towny without any solid scum reads. It feels like he is opening himself up to vote on any lynchmob while trying to make it look like he is contributing by doing almost entirely feeling and behavioral analysis that falls flat. <br>\n<br>\nMy initial read of gameplay was that he was just a green town, but I think there is more damning evidence in these two quoted posts than any of the other cases made so far. BJC and Varsoon are trying to lynch people based on meta and super secret scum tell analysis, which is fine if that works for you, I guess, but gameplay is exhibiting very wishy washy, opportunistic behavior which makes him a safer choice for scum.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: QM</span> <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: gameplay506</span>", "time": "Sun May 11, 2014 3:58 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=51535&start=150", "forum": "53", "thread": "51535"}

Why exactly have you jumped to playing the victim? And lol, no one is being egotistical or insisting they're better than you. What's up with playing the victim card? I pointed out that I'm actually decent at getting early gut reads on people. How about this:<br>\n<br>\nI said that because you and ICE gave me an early gut read of scum, and antihero saw some of the same things in the same exact posts. You just kind of brushed it off, okay fine. I can't further analyze your play if that's what you're going to do, so I encouraged others to build up your wagon. The only way to get you to play, and to get you to interact with us, is to threaten you via a wagon. Some people like to call them pressure wagons, and that's what they are, but I don't openly call them so. You probably wouldn't feel any pressure to play had I done that... TL;DR I still think you're scummy, and you're acting like a little shit.<br>\n<br>\nAnd still, other than asking why we aren't focused on another player (granted, Loot's vote is kind of shit), you don't produce much of anything.  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":neutral:\" title=\"Neutral\"> Okay.<br>\n<br>\nTo give you the benefit of the doubt, and possibly encourage you to post something constructive, I'll <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">unvote; vote: Lootifer</div> Stop being a little shit either way.<br>\n<br>\n@QM - I said that in one event, he's likely to be scum.

In fact its so weak I dont really respond to cases brought against me that are mostly based on meta analysis.\n</div></blockquote>\nI agree completely. I use meta very minimally, and the only reason I mentioned that at all is because of how recent the last game was. I honestly feel like it has more to do with her frame of a mind as a person in RL right now than it does her alignment in mafia (or more likely her frame of mind while the linked game was going on).\n<blockquote><div><cite>bjc wrote:</cite>\nYou should also explain why you are on NS instead of rofl while youve deemed both to be good votes. What did you see Varsoon doing that made you feel like NS was a better vote?\n</div></blockquote>\nBoth of them are good votes. It doesn't really matter to me which one I'm on. I believe I had seen Varsoon point out that his anti-RVS vote became a real vote based on reactions and liked it before I saw rofl posting multiple bad posts.\n<blockquote><div><cite>bjc wrote:</cite>\nYeah it is definitely easier to say someone dropped a town tell when youre scum, I think we all know that.\n</div></blockquote>\nI honestly have no idea where you get this. Scum want to leave their reads as open to interpretation as possible so they can switch if there's a good reason to wagon a strong player. In fact, you encourage Antihero in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5884849#p5884849\">170</a> who calls rofl out for being hedgey when giving town reads.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5883016#p5883016\">133</a> by gameplay was decent. (WRITTEN LATER) A lot of people are hating on this post and I don't see it. He gave his opinions on the wagons and joined arguably the best one for good reasoning.

I'm not saying anything about the alignment I'm saying I feel like the person itself feels different. The Titus that is playing in this game is not the Titus that was playing in my linked game, and it would take more than a difference in alignment to account for that change.

You should be able to get an idea of what I'm pointing out here. He's making statements about things and calling them odd and silly and a joke, but never saying anything about how he feels it impacts alignment. Some info without analysis is fine, but look at the rest of the post. The ONLY actual stance he gives is a slight townread of me which, considering how ridiculous my first vote of the game was, makes little sense. The only reason I can see someone wanting to give me a town read at that point in the game was to buddy up against someone who looks potentially dangerous. This read is <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">especially problematic</div> because of this gem, which I missed my first time around in response to someone else calling me town:\n<blockquote><div><cite>gameplay wrote:</cite>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>ice is town despite his misgivings about verbiage</div></blockquote>\nThis was really strange and it is so because it is really odd for a townie to be sure in someone. How can you be sure of anyone's alignment if you are a townie? That suggest to me that you can have so other information or more specifically knowing who are the scum.\n</div></blockquote>\nThis was stated only a few ISO posts after giving me a town read. He is clearly not remembering his own reads, because they are fabricated. Now I did indeed like that post my first readthrough, but the more I'm looking at it he keeps using the verbage \"this looks strange\" etc. and not actually calling anything scummy. In my quoted paragraph he used BOTH \"strange\" and \"odd\" in one sentence. When called out about his reasoning for a rofl vote, he has nothing despite many posts indicating that he feels strongly about roflscum.<br>\n<br>\nAll the sudden pressure is on him and bam, Titus is obvscum along with AtE to get out of pressure.<br>\n<br>\nScum.", "time": "Mon May 12, 2014 7:37 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=51535&start=250", "forum": "53", "thread": "51535"}

I'll love to prove you wrong if you can. It's not exactly hard to do to show you being pro-active in other games and show how you were being lazy here...

This day one is a roller coaster of emotion. <br>\n<br>\nGameplay, you seriously need to accept that it's nobody's fault but your own that you got to L-1. You were playing very anti-town. The cases to be made against you have already been made and it doesn't look like it's going to happen, so I'm just going to hope you shore it up a bit, and start taking the punches when you get some pressure on you if you're a townie.

His first post including actual content doesn't come until his 10th post on page 3, long after people have actually started to make active contributions in game. Also, said post pointed out all very important stuff but included zero analysis of anything. Pointing out that someone is lurking, pointing out that someone didn't include reasoning for a vote, etc. is great, but he didn't state that anything pinged his scumdar. This gives an early bad impression, as he's got a high word count without much in the way of anything used to read off of him. Definitely benefits scum for the early section.<br>\n<br>\nLater on page 3, his content picks up though. He also explains his lack of recent experience with forum based mafia, which explains a slow start. His post quality continues to improve, and he impresses me particularly with his thoughts in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5878395#p5878395\">58</a>. He seems to do a very good job of looking at things without confirmation bias. He gives convincing reasons for his votes, despite saying a few things I disagree with, and has been leaning town for a decent while. I'm slightly concerned with how quickly he switched his vote to Lootifer, but it seems like Loot will end up being the \"compromise\" lynch anyway, as it seems like everyone has at least a mild scumread on him.<br>\n<br>\nLeaning town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Antihero:</div> This guy has contributed almost nothing. He throws down a random looking vote on page 7, which I never consider a town aligned thing to do. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5886144#p5886144\">182</a> bugs me since I was also off the site for a little while and bjc was badgering me to respond to his posts. His vote on me is crap and his calling my votes \"hilarious bad\" is also crap.<br>\n<br>\nI don't really see a lot to indicate alignment, just a lot of uselessness.<br>\n<br>\nAnti-town, but impossible to determine alignment.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">bjc:</div> This guy arguably has the most content of any player. He's spent the entire day with confirmation bias about me being scum. Basically from one post feeling \"off\" to him, he's been focusing pretty heavily on me on and off for at least half of this game. To his credit, he hasn't been tunneling on me. With several posts worth of scum hunting towards Loot and rofl, and being crystal clear about his town reads, I don't see very much that could suggest this guy is anything but determined to lynch scum, despite being misguided about me.<br>\n<br>\nAs solid of a town read as I could have for day 1.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Blue Yoshi:</div> Oh look, another low content player who wants to lynch me. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5883424#p5883424\">143</a> makes ABSOLUTELY no sense, considering I was saying how Titus was dramatically different this game from the town game she and I had played together, I don't even understand how someone could construe this as me \"pushing town Titus\". Much of the rest of his posting is \"I don't really want to read this game\". He has kept his vote on me because apparently I'm being passive aggressive, which once again makes absolutely no sense.<br>\n<br>\nHe is either scum trying to stay under the radar or is town who needs to replace out of this game. Not sure which.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Gameplay506:</div> We have a high post count player, but arguably not that high of a content poster. More than anyone, I feel like I've been fairly clear about my opinions of gameplay. For reasons that both I and others have pointed out, he seemed extremely scummy. His defeatism, however, makes no sense whatsoever in a daytalk game unless his scum buddy is absent from it. So either he's scum with someone like Antihero or Blue Yoshi or he's town that needs to not just fucking give up when times get hard. If we lynch scum who proved to be inactive during gameplay's defeatist shit then I'll be more than happy to lynch this guy, but unless that happens I don't like him for scum.<br>\n<br>\nTown, pending a scum flip who was inactive at a specific point in this game.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Titus:</div> The early game seems to be largely spent on getting discussion going, and being willing to do controversial things to do it. This is something I explicitly do as town, and like it. The difference in play from such a recent game confused me, but has since been squared away so I'm not so worried about that. Titus is probably tied with bjc in terms of active content and scum hunting, and comes off as extremely unbiased and hasn't shown much in the way of tunnel vision. While like Varsoon and bjc I have to be careful about having an excessively strong town bias, I don't see any reason for Titus to be scum at this point.<br>\n<br>\nLooking town.", "time": "Fri May 16, 2014 10:57 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=51535&start=475", "forum": "53", "thread": "51535"}

His first post including actual content doesn't come until his 10th post on page 3, long after people have actually started to make active contributions in game. Also, said post pointed out all very important stuff but included zero analysis of anything. Pointing out that someone is lurking, pointing out that someone didn't include reasoning for a vote, etc. is great, but he didn't state that anything pinged his scumdar. This gives an early bad impression, as he's got a high word count without much in the way of anything used to read off of him. Definitely benefits scum for the early section.<br>\n<br>\nLater on page 3, his content picks up though. He also explains his lack of recent experience with forum based mafia, which explains a slow start. His post quality continues to improve, and he impresses me particularly with his thoughts in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5878395#p5878395\">58</a>. He seems to do a very good job of looking at things without confirmation bias. He gives convincing reasons for his votes, despite saying a few things I disagree with, and has been leaning town for a decent while. I'm slightly concerned with how quickly he switched his vote to Lootifer, but it seems like Loot will end up being the \"compromise\" lynch anyway, as it seems like everyone has at least a mild scumread on him.<br>\n<br>\nLeaning town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Antihero:</div> This guy has contributed almost nothing. He throws down a random looking vote on page 7, which I never consider a town aligned thing to do. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5886144#p5886144\">182</a> bugs me since I was also off the site for a little while and bjc was badgering me to respond to his posts. His vote on me is crap and his calling my votes \"hilarious bad\" is also crap.<br>\n<br>\nI don't really see a lot to indicate alignment, just a lot of uselessness.<br>\n<br>\nAnti-town, but impossible to determine alignment.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">bjc:</div> This guy arguably has the most content of any player. He's spent the entire day with confirmation bias about me being scum. Basically from one post feeling \"off\" to him, he's been focusing pretty heavily on me on and off for at least half of this game. To his credit, he hasn't been tunneling on me. With several posts worth of scum hunting towards Loot and rofl, and being crystal clear about his town reads, I don't see very much that could suggest this guy is anything but determined to lynch scum, despite being misguided about me.<br>\n<br>\nAs solid of a town read as I could have for day 1.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Blue Yoshi:</div> Oh look, another low content player who wants to lynch me. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5883424#p5883424\">143</a> makes ABSOLUTELY no sense, considering I was saying how Titus was dramatically different this game from the town game she and I had played together, I don't even understand how someone could construe this as me \"pushing town Titus\". Much of the rest of his posting is \"I don't really want to read this game\". He has kept his vote on me because apparently I'm being passive aggressive, which once again makes absolutely no sense.<br>\n<br>\nHe is either scum trying to stay under the radar or is town who needs to replace out of this game. Not sure which.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Gameplay506:</div> We have a high post count player, but arguably not that high of a content poster. More than anyone, I feel like I've been fairly clear about my opinions of gameplay. For reasons that both I and others have pointed out, he seemed extremely scummy. His defeatism, however, makes no sense whatsoever in a daytalk game unless his scum buddy is absent from it. So either he's scum with someone like Antihero or Blue Yoshi or he's town that needs to not just fucking give up when times get hard. If we lynch scum who proved to be inactive during gameplay's defeatist shit then I'll be more than happy to lynch this guy, but unless that happens I don't like him for scum.<br>\n<br>\nTown, pending a scum flip who was inactive at a specific point in this game.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Titus:</div> The early game seems to be largely spent on getting discussion going, and being willing to do controversial things to do it. This is something I explicitly do as town, and like it. The difference in play from such a recent game confused me, but has since been squared away so I'm not so worried about that. Titus is probably tied with bjc in terms of active content and scum hunting, and comes off as extremely unbiased and hasn't shown much in the way of tunnel vision. While like Varsoon and bjc I have to be careful about having an excessively strong town bias, I don't see any reason for Titus to be scum at this point.<br>\n<br>\nLooking town.</div></blockquote>\n\nAntihero, Ugh. This guy isn't posting enough. I wouldn't say anti-town yet. His play is a bit of a flashback to Open 529 hosted by Nobody Special. Defenitely something to watch if the similarities continue.<br>\n<br>\nAnatole, this guy is my biggest townread. I seem to be agreeing with him a lot which is good for day 1. I will have to watch him but I'll bet he's town for now.<br>\n<br>\nbjc, his aggression reads a little awkward but is definitely protown in his contributions. Town for now, but I can't get that feeling that says OMG he is town.<br>\n<br>\nBlue Yoshi, I'm leaning scum here. All he's done is bitch that the game isn't moving and has provided no real effort, saying he doesn't care to. If you don't care to play as town, sub out. There's little reason for demotivational statements and they only help scum. An active and communicating town is a good thing.<br>\n<br>\nGameplay, he's new and I can tell. He keeps waffling between playstyles making hard to get a consistent read on him. I'm leaning town because of the fact newb!scum probably wouldn't want to stand out and he's had his moments of contributing new and unique thoughts.<br>\n<br>\nIceNinja, he seems to be similar to bjc in posting style. They both have a lot of contributions and awkward aggression. It definitely doesn't read as passive aggression, but I can't really understand why IceNinja reacts the way he does. For example, I took off for a few hours and he's upset about the posting not being there. Paranoia is usually considered a towntell, so strong lean town here.<br>\n<br>\nNeil113 - hyperdefensive and providing little in the way of new thoughts. Whenever someone suspects him, he attacks them. His mood flips on a dime. I don't care for him at all.<br>\n<br>\nNS, he needs to sub out or post, regardless of alignment.<br>\n<br>\nrofl - I like rofl as town. He really has a off-way of posting, such as Death's Diner, so I give him a little more slack. Seriously, read his ISO that game. The dude's ISO from that game, if you attached all the sentences end to end, is probably shorter than my posts today combined... and he was town.<br>\n<br>\nVarsoon - Quiet Varsoon scares me. Active Varsoon scum in Open 512 was caught due to his CCing opponent being obvtown. In See Minus Minus (the sequel to Open 512), Varsoon and I drew scum together. Our strategy there was to let the town divide itself apart. Varsoon's smart and I expect something from him soon. He's just as much of an asset as he is a liability though. We've got to shake Varsoon up somehow to get him out of his zen state.", "time": "Fri May 16, 2014 6:38 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=51535&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "51535"}

You can't expect to point that VCA out and ride it all the way through, as town or scum. Locking into PoE is something that lost me most of my games as town, and certainly others have felt the same, and scum love to lock themselves into PoE to minimize work.

In addition to rofl's rebuttal, I would add that Anti has access to this entire thread.  If he were actually convinced that scumhunting in this game is that easy, it makes no sense for him not to actually read the thread and find who was responsible for the PL on lurkers instead of voting the three players on both lynches for no reason.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nRegardless, intent to hammer QM unless someone votes Anti ASAP.", "time": "Tue Jun 17, 2014 1:56 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=51535&start=1025", "forum": "53", "thread": "51535"}

Town knows we only need 2 votes (Ly-Lo) so they'd be much more reserved with their voting right now. The only person that would benefit from pushing a quick lynch right now, is scum. Consider, Anatole could not honestly see me so much more likely to be scum than you Gameplay, that he'd place a vote down because I'm \"confirmed scum\" that he'd be willing to mislynch as town by putting a vote on me. If you're scum, you'd hammer quickly and win. Consider this, how could Anatole really consider you to be so town that he'd be so quick to place a vote down on me? Nobody in this game thought of you as confirmed town and to be quite honest, I wasn't sure who I would vote here, between Anatole and you. Because you're far from confirmed town in my opinion. Considering I don't think Anatole is a VI who would put a vote down ready to end the game so quickly as town, my idea on who to vote leans heavily toward him.<br>\n<br>\nSeeing as now, if you're scum, you can already win this no matter who you vote, I'll go ahead and <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Anatole</span>. So either you're going to vote and hammer one of us as scum and win, or you're town and you're going to hammer me and lose or Anatole and win the game for us. I haven't followed much the past couple of weeks as IRL stuff has happened (which is why I haven't posted anywhere on this site tbh, it's not just this game that I've been deflecting, which I think you've mentioned before) so I can't make too much of a case on Anatole right now. From what I've seen though, you've been following carefully enough to make your own decision. Read through, figure things out, I'll be here off and on as much as I can to talk with you if you have any questions for me. Don't rush into a decision though. We have plenty of time.<br>\n<br>\nSomething else to consider. You've been against me literally all game. You've jumped down my throat with Titus the literal entire game. If Titus died because \"she knew I was mafia\" as Anatole so kindly pointed out, then how come you're still alive? Why would I leave a supposed \"VI\" who is dead-set against me (and last day phase, sang songs of killing me and promised you'd hang me today) alive in Ly-Lo to vote me? Anybody who was watching or reading through this game, regardless of how much they read, a quick ISO would reveal your vote would be on me during this day phase. How is that smart scum play at all? ROFL was at least somewhat suspicious of myself and Anatole, and not dead-set on me like you were... it'd make more sense for me to kill you today, and claim I was set-up. At least then I'd have a chance. The only person it would benefit having ROFL die more than you is... Anatole.<br>\n<br>\nSo yeah, do your analysis but if your put two and two together, the scum as Anatole makes complete sense, a lot more than just your confbias on me. But you're going to make the decision in the end, and unfortunately I do think you're going to hammer me either as scum or town so I don't see much sense in me trying to sway your opinion. You're either scum, and you're going to win this by hammering me, or you're town and we're going to lose. I'd like you to at least talk it out with me before you hammer me though, if that's okay with you... so at least we have some chance at winning this. If you do hammer me though and not want to talk, good game then.<br>\n<br>\nP.S. (and kind of off-topic) If you really are a VI, and you are scum, the best play here is to hammer me and win the game FYI. If you're scum and you don't hammer me, I'm going to be seriously pissed and I will black-list you. There's no reason to play against your win-condition and toy with me and Anatole. So if you're scum and you don't hammer myself or Anatole right now, I will not play another game with you on this site.", "time": "Sat Jul 05, 2014 4:04 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=51535&start=1225", "forum": "53", "thread": "51535"}

His value on survival was specifically to see since I suspected him as a new player, that he could slip up and give me an idea of what his role (scum) is if he valued highly on his survival more than everyone elses, and was willing to sacrifice others to survive himself.

The only way you could ever try and push a case on me, is if you're an idiot, or you're scum trying to mislynch. There's nothing there that is scummy. Everyone in the entire game recognized that, so when someone tried to create something out of nothing, that was scummy to me. I don't base half my votes on OMGUS, in fact very little of my votes were. My votes were on how terrible cases were, and it wasn't just people making cases on me.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5998421#p5998421\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5998421#p5998421\" data-post-id=\"5998421\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1265</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23762\">gameplay506</a> wrote:</cite>Neil why when you state that you had played with ICE you dont communicate with him at all?</div></blockquote>\n\nBecause Ice never pinged my radar much.

All of those questions had relevance. How much experienced had the obvious relevance of, is he prone to make newb mistakes? How do you think you'll respond when you're attacked gave me insight onto his defensive levels and rather they were his play-style, or over-reaction. His value on survival was specifically to see since I suspected him as a new player, that he could slip up and give me an idea of what his role (scum) is if he valued highly on his survival more than everyone elses, and was willing to sacrifice others to survive himself.
