You are not allowed quote any out of thread communication.<br>\n2. Mafia can only talk during the night phase and pre-game confirmations, and no member is to message each other pertaining to the game. (If you are caught doing so, you will be Modkilled). <br>\n3. Play to your win-condition, if you are caught not playing to your win-condition, you will be Mod-killed and will turn into a Neutral Survivor.<br>\n4. If you have an ability, you must either PM me a Target or a No Action PM, if you don&#8217;t send me a &#8220;No Action&#8221; you will be giving up an opportunity to use your ability for the night.<br>\n5. You must post every 72 hours, failure to do so will result in a prod. You may be given three grace prods but once you reach the fourth prod you will be replaced. Failure to respond to the prod within 24 hours will result in replacement.<br>\n6. Do not attempt to use any hidden coding, or small text tags, all text must be visible. If you are caught you will be issued a warning, if it happens again you will be mod-killed.<br>\n7. You must vote with the appropriate tags with either <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Kdowns</span>; <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote:Kdowns</div>.<br>\n8. You don't have to unvote before you place another vote but it is much appreciated.<br>\n9. Once a simple majority of votes on a player has been reached a lynch will occur.<br>\n10. Day deadlines will be 3 weeks.<br>\n11.If the day deadline has been hit and a majority has not been reached, the player who has the most votes will be lynched. In case of a tie, the person who has hit it first will be lynched.<br>\n12. Night Phase will last 72 hours, in which you need to send me a PM if you have an ability.<br>\n13. You may vote to no lynch, and if half the player list agrees, you will not lynch anyone.<br>\n14. Once you are Killed you may not post at all in the game thread except for one BAH post, that contains no game related content.<br>\n15. Please Bold all requests for the Mod, so that it will be easier for me to see it.<br>\n16. If you encounter any problems with the game, please message me in private.<br>\n17. Prods will be issued every 72 hours, if I have missed someone that needs to be prodded please tell me.<br>\n18. If you are going to be missing for more than 48 hours please tell me ahead of time.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSample Town PM:<br>\nPlayer XXX, you are a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vanillia Townie</div>.

Here are two problems with that.<br>\n1)\tHe has no reasoning. He didn&#8217;t even state anything about rolefishing until Post 32.

So I&#8217;m going to give you a basic lesson in mafia theory. For newbie mafia players,  it is common  for them to hammer, be 2nd to last to hammer, or be the starter of the BW. MonkeyMan doesn&#8217;t strike me as that kind of person. Much more experienced players will definitely mix things up. Taking the 2nd spot is a very common move for players in these categories.

Remember what I said before: 2nd spot is a common spot. Now, in Post 45, it is discovered I am at L-1. ICE and deadjoker have commented that a quick lynch is unwise. MonkeyMan is the first to unvote. To me, this is just an attempt to get towncred by being the first to unvote, rather than unvoting when everyone else unvotes. It&#8217;s even worse that he should know that a hammer this stupid from a real mafia is suicidal so there&#8217;s little risk in that.

I see rolefishing as inherently anti-Town, as any results you kick up as Town are going to be obvious to Scum as well. Others have pointed out that he abandoned the tactic too hastily to get useful results out of it. However, he has not since exhibited other anti-Town behavior-- his other posts have been helpful. I'm still suspicious of him, but I think there are better candidates for a lynch today.<br>\n<br>\ndeadjoker seems more concerned with avoiding getting himself lynched than with helping us find someone to lynch. It's as simple as that. He was also more interested in how certain other people were about lynching thezmon221 than in how certain he was about it.<br>\n<br>\nIf we lynch thezmon221 and he flips Scum, I'm going to push hard for deadjoker next-- because them being scumbuddies almost perfectly explains the latter's behavior. Between the two, though, I think deadjoker is scummier. Thezmon221's rolefishing was so blatant that it almost makes sense as a reverse psychology ploy-- a gambit he may have sacrificed too quickly when it almost got him lynched.<br>\n<br>\nMy candidate for scummiest right now, and the best lynch candidate, is MonkeyMan576. With the exception of his finger for DCLXVI, he hasn't given very much reason-- or very good reasons-- for anything he's done or said and with the exception of accusing thezmon221 of OMGUS and calling him scum, everyone he's tried to raise suspicion over is someone I consider more likely to be Town. I don't think he would have gotten away with fingering ICEninja directly-- I think everyone considers him Town at this point-- but even so he tried to undermine him by questioning his temper and his judgment without actually questioning his reasoning.<br>\n<br>\nSo that's who I'm gunning for right now.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: MonkeyMan576</span><br>\n<br>\nIt's also interesting to note that the two players I consider strongest Town-- ICEninja and Jon-- are voting for the lurker (whom I've admittedly got no read on) but that the third vote, again with little support, comes from MonkeyMan576. Unless MonkeyMan576 flips Town, that makes me wonder if hoko isn't just Town who needs to speak up more.<br>\n<br>\nI could be swayed to vote for hoko today, but I want more evidence that he's Scum first.

I'll mention the important stuff and stuff that was directed about/to me. If anyone needs me to respond to anything specific, let me know.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>joker wrote:</cite><br>\nYour early game play was brilliant. You knew that since it was so early in day 1 you wouldnt be risking a quick lynch as no one wanted the day to end so quickly. ICE got town cred, which he made sure he got by his multiple claims to getting us out of RVS, and you were able to tank an early bandwagon which would be hard to revive later.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nThat's quite the story there. If we're willing to stretch that far we can make scum buddies out of pretty much any two players. That isn't scum hunting, that's finding ways to paint someone as scummy.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>joker wrote:</cite><br>\nAnd ice wasn't able to answer why he voted monkey after monkey soft claimed. What town would vote a soft claim to l-1?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nHis soft claim was scummy as hell. However, his claim was weird and after weighing things out I think it's best we lynch someone else today.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Kondi wrote:</cite><br>\nThe fact that he hasn't committed any time into finding probable town in Post #122 strikes me as odd.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nI have my town reads. I'm just not saying them because I don't want scum shooting them.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Kondi wrote:</cite><br>\nHe also really has a thing for pushing players that don't know how to defend themselves<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nI've voted and pushed for 3 people, and joker isn't one of them. Check your facts.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Kondi wrote:</cite><br>\nit's odd that he never really mentions his reasoning for a read on Haze, who also hadn't added much of anything to the game when he posted his reads.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nI don't have a particularly strong read on Haze. I'm more interested in seeing where my main several scum reads and finding out where pursuing those reads goes.<br>\n<br>\nYou haven't given a single point as to why I'm scum.<br>\n<br>\nHoko makes yet another post without a single statement as to who he thinks is scum. Honestly though, I'm just starting to think this guy is completely clueless and has no idea how to play this game, as opposed to being scummy as hell.<br>\n<br>\nActually in taking another thought, I can really go either way on lynching Monkey. The risk-reward (between lynching scum and lynching PR) isn't so bad, as a bodyguard isn't worth too much to town anyway unless we've got more powerful PRs claimed. However, it also seems like we could really just leave Monkey around for a day or two and see what happens. If scum is smart they aren't going to kill him so he'll probably be around anyway, and if he's telling the truth he might have the opportunity to protect a solid town read or anyone who claims PR tomorrow.<br>\n<br>\nI'm going to leave my vote off for the moment and take a night to think about things. I'll come back with a stronger stance tomorrow. I'm currently leaning not lynching Monkey, though.", "time": "Sat Mar 17, 2012 5:11 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21340&start=300", "forum": "53", "thread": "21340"}

My opinions on possible people to lynch go mainly to MonkeyMan and DeadJoker.<br>\n<br>\nMy main reasons for thinking of Deadjoker are tied with his votes. DeadJoker is such a fan of short posts that he himself doesn't seem to be able to back his own votes. My first clue was his out-of-nowhere vote on me, on post  99. I've explain in what way am I a newbie. I backed my votes, I'm sorry if I waited for people to \"validate\" them [/sarcasm] to vote for them. Also, the combination of these explanations accounts for my wishy washyness - it's insecurity. <br>\nAnother out-of-nowhere vote comes in post 256, in which he accuses Thez of being ICE's scumbuddy. As far as I know, it is not unheard of for the seemingly more pro-town players to be scum, but I don't think this here is the case, nor do I believe in the far-fetched explanations he got. That rabbit-out-of-a-tall-hat loses yet more consistency because it persupposes that ICE and Thez would previously know how to get Monkey to out his (pseudo-)PR as soon as he actually did, which is a one in a million chance, specially on Day1. As he himself would say, I'm not drinking that koolaid. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMonkeyMan gets to me because of his persistant deflection strategy. Most times he gets voted, he just either gets a faulty reasoning that provides a valid reason to OMGUS-vote, which is the case, I believe, of post 212. His \"arguments\" are actually only a divergence in gameplay style. When that didn't work he recurred to deflect to someone else, on post 225, attacking his own sheep, Elmo, the only guy that actually got on the DCL proto-bandwagon. When <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">that</div> didn't work either... well... let's WIFOM the sons'bitches with a BG role claim. And it worked - there is a great number of posts discussing what to do with this (mis-)info.

We've gotten rid of the scummiest player on D1 and if you're acting so scummy that when some people (even me to an extent) may believe that you are telling the truth in your claim, but still see you as scummy, the lynch still helps the town because, like I said, it gets rid of a distraction. In any case, we will definitely have some things to consider, no matter what you flip.

I mean, sure, Policy Lynching is bad. But when people are so adamant about a lynch... It ends up helping their cause no matter the flip. I mean, yeah I hope you turn up mafia, but either way you aren't a distraction because of your contradictions, your deflections, your grasping of straws, and your apparent inability to scumhunt.

DCL and Thez seemed to be pushing a wee bit too hard on him, insisting on his lynching, when the whole of the players had both players in mind - Monkey and Joker. They seemed to push for Monkey. But then again, that could be explained by the scum act - I am very uncertain about them... As I said, they dropped a few points on my town radar, but... who knows?<br>\n<br>\nJoker - I had made a case on him before, already, mainly given a) His always very assured assumptions and b) His constant flips on his assured assumptions. He claims something with certainty, and later he completely denies the former and comes up with an entirely new theory - the thez/ICE conspiracy theory comes to mind. But then again, he <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">was</div> right about Monkey - I'm simply wondering if he had any \"safe\" information or if that was one of his short-lived 100%certain theories. <br>\n<br>\nThen there is hokorippoi, who is now much more active, because he doesn't do well on Day1's, apparently.

My question about his scum rating on thez was because he jumped off the bandwagon once it got hot. While his initial reasoning was sound, that he didn't want a quick day 1 lynch, he largely stopped pressuring thez and analyzing his posts and slipped over to the monkey bandwagon. When I asked him to put a number to his thez scum read, he balked. Hence my connection was made. I'm not in the business of hunting for just one scum, so I pressured BP because he was puppy dogging ICE. BP claimed he was a newbie, so I needed to see if he was a newbie town who sheeps, or a bad scum who is bad at hiding.  With my read on BP complete, it was time to find another, or to see if there was another scum team. Before I could get my reads, the pressure on monkey was red hot, so after reading his ISO I was reasonably sure he wasn't scum. Once again the thez and ice connection bled through, which only furthered my read on monkey. After posting my reads, I saw DCL push for a monkey lynch despite an alternate theory being presented.

When you can do someone's iso in under 10 minutes and be able to quote all of someone's posts in one post without it getting to big, there is a problem.<br>\n<br>\nWhat I've done is give full quotes of all his posts so you guys don't have to go through and dig them out cause doing so is kind of annoying. They are all at the bottom of this post and I will be referencing them by number.<br>\n<br>\nOk, so haze has made 9 posts up to post 400, I know we have gone further but he declared V/la in 403. But still, with 13 players and a mod, 400 divided by 14 equals roughly 28. Haze has only posted 9 times and when you look further at his posts the number really is less. Here is a quick summery of Haze's posts:<br>\n<br>\n36: Gets confused and mistakenly thinks thez has actually asks for 1:1, votes thez.<br>\n67: Admits mistake in post 36, asks thez a few questions, says he has his eye on bp.<br>\n132: Expresses suspicion of monkey, seems to praise thez by saying thez had the best reasoning/<br>\n139: Irrelevant Silly comment <br>\n176: Question about replacing<br>\n177:agrees with joker and wonders why ICE is ignoring monkey/thez<br>\n178: Says he has read ICE's iso and says ICE has ignored the monkey/thez spat<br>\n317:Doesn't agree with Kondi's post about himself and ICE, says he wants monkey to hang.<br>\n403: Tells everyone he is going V/la<br>\n<br>\nOk, posts 139, and 403 have nothing to do with the thread content, and Posts 176,177,178 can be considered one post as they appeared back-back. This would leave Haze with having 5 actual posts with any content in it. A astoundingly low number considered the content level of this game.<br>\n<br>\nA few things stand out to me as suspicious:<br>\n<br>\n1. No attempt at scumhunting whatsoever. He makes a few comments about different people, but mostly about what other people have said and no accusations by himself.<br>\n<br>\n2. He votes thez in 36 and leaves it there. Doesn't change it to ice when he questions ICE, and doesn't change it to monkey when he says monkey is who he wants to hang.<br>\n<br>\n3. Minimal amounts of content while he was around.<br>\n<br>\n4. He doesn't consistently think that anyone is scum and the few times were he expressed that he thought someone was suspicious he didn't act on it.<br>\n<br>\nHopefully he gets more into the game now, but that still won't change how he acted day one, which is very suspicious. <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">FoS Haze</div><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=3914709#p3914709\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=3914709#p3914709\" data-post-id=\"3914709\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 36</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16013\">Haze</a> wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: ThesMon</span><br>\n<br>\nWhy are you asking for 1v1 already? @_@</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=3916054#p3916054\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=3916054#p3916054\" data-post-id=\"3916054\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 67</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16013\">Haze</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=3915057#p3915057\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=3915057#p3915057\" data-post-id=\"3915057\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 43</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12670\">ICEninja</a> wrote:</cite>Haze your vote doesn't make sense.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Haze wrote:</cite><br>\nWhy are you asking for 1v1 already? @_@<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nHe didn't ask for a 1v1.

It feels very much like a scum concerted effort. Meaning I'm suspicious of Jon, Thez and BP.<br>\n<br>\nOnto Kondi's NK: Suggests 1 of 2 things, or both: Either Kondi was right on with all his reads or He was the best town player. Meaning we should ISO him and treat the other current town leaders ICE and Thez with suspicion (IE if 1st was true, then we need check his reads, and if 2nd were true then it doesn't make sense for ICE/Thez who seemed more pro-town to not be shot.) Of course he could be killed purely because another player hated him. But that's a rather illogical move. Ok. whatever. Wifom. Just a thought. Also shit ignore this part lol. Yeha Kondi isn't an easy mislynch, as opposed to me in my current position. Editing this chunk again, (more thoughts) wonder if Kondi was offed just for coming up with a way to use a claimed bodyguard effectively. I think of this as I read thez's 464 where he claims that Monkey was a major distraction and that offing him was a good idea/policy. I think that if we kept Monkey he would essentially have been a nice meat sheild. Thus I consider whether or not Thez's justification has scummy motivations: Why would you ever dismiss a town PR's usefulness to town? only when you're afraid real town would realise. I also think that at any given point if people think a Lynchee is town then they shouldn't be lynched regardless of what position they may be in. I think that nobody who decided to lynch Monkey after his claim anyway can really justify their actions.<br>\n<br>\nAlso as a response to 451 Thez being pissed about me not posting: you guys lynched him quite quickly before I really had a chance to say anything, and by the time day 2 was back up camp had come along.<br>\n<br>\nAnnddd the rest of the thread is speculation on how strong a read a Lurking should attribute to scummyness.<br>\n<br>\nWell there's not much for me to say other than explain my situation.

I understand that you may be legitimately looking for scum... but three times you appear very close to the end? It might be a fluke, it might not be. Third-to-last on the final lynches though? With VK following the hoko and jon hammering? There's a few questions regarding that.<br>\n<br>\nAlso relating to the hoko lynch, I checked your ISO just to see what sort of circumstances there were, and you didn't reflect too much on why you wanted to lynch hoko. Sure, you made a few statements, but that was about 20 hours before and then, once again, you conveniently place yourself at the second-to-last.<br>\n<br>\nWhy you might be linked to <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Elmo</div>: Well, the points you stated do, as I said before, very little for me. And that goes either way. I see it more as a bussing attempt and the fact that you used that to show why you were innocent sent a bell or two because it seems more like a bus attempt to me since it was subtle, but still there.<br>\n<br>\nWhy you might be linked to <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">VK</div>: Well, it was the whole instance of lynching hoko. A bandwagon was forming, Elmo voted again because he apparently forgot he voted before. You vote for hoko to put him at L-1, but really he's at L-2. VK goes to lay the hammer conveniently, but then everyone realizes that Elmo voted to put him at L-3. To me, this seems like an attempt by Elmo to mask the two of you with confusion.<br>\n<br>\nWhy you might be linked to <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">jon</div>: You have conveniently been third-to-last on both final lynches, jon has been the hammer. In the occasion of monkey, he did declare intent, but he hammered early. In the event of hoko, he waltzed in and hammered after I had already declared intent, and that is a much, much more obvious attempt to quick-hammer hoko.<br>\n<br>\nEither way, I can see links between you, but I don't see as many links between VK and jon as the two with you, which is why I'm settling on you for now. There is probably a pretty decent chance of me switching votes again because the three of you oscillate in position, but you seem to be the most solid of the three for now and I'm going to have to observe more 1-on-1 interactions as we have...8 people left, which means that scum makes up 1/4-3/8 of the group.<br>\n<br>\nI'm probably going to get a lot of flak for this statement, but remember guys: there <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">could</div></div></div> be a total of 4 scum. We did start with 12 people, so that would make up exactly 1/3 of the game, which is a good balance, but there could be 3 scum which would be at a ratio of 1/4, which is also an optimal balance. For now I'm hoping that there are just 2 more scum because that will make our jobs much easier.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>DCLXVI wrote:</cite>@thez, hm, your read on me seems to have changed a lot, could you perhaps provide a little more detail as to why you now think I'm scum?</div></blockquote>And that's the beauty of when you have a kill you can actually analyze.

In fact, I'd go so far as to say I'm quite possibly the most hated person in this game (on a game level, not personal) because of how I've played all game from the reaction-fish to Monkey's lynch to the big debate with joker. It doesn't take a genius to realize I've been acting scummy to many people.<br>\n<br>\nNow, on to my point, D2 there was a big debate between joker and me. We both took a TON of flak, but now both are alive. Why? Because hoko comes out of nowhere with questionable posts. What I think is that the scum, being Elmo and DCL (I haven't decided who else) decided to try to get a lynch on a person who won't cause as much noise. This would also explain why Elmo didn't hammer me yesterday as I expected he would. The two (and their third buddy) flipped the ship VERY effectively, killing hoko who was always quiet and never did much. The quoted just below helps solidify that reasoning:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>deadjoker wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>deadjoker wrote:</cite>It's not WIFOM.

Killing ICE was probably one of their best bets, either him or jon (assuming jon is town).<br>\n<br>\nThat is partly why I also question jon's alignment. Why would they decide to kill ICE over jon? I can only think of two reasons.<br>\n1) jon is scum.<br>\n2) jon (assuming town) doesn't contribute as much to scumhunting as ICE does.<br>\n<br>\n#1 makes slightly more sense to me because if he's town, then he's been obv town all game long. ICE was far from obv town to anyone but me and maybe one or two other people.<br>\n<br>\nYou see, this is where me being 8-1 as a mafia comes into play. I might have more than double the games as a town, but I can think like mafia. I'm pretty insightful when it comes to things like that, though my questions are usually pretty hypothetical and occasionally filled with WIFOM. But, back to my point, #2 just doesn't make as much sense in my eyes. Due to experience as scum, I can think of reasons why a scum would want to kill a person, and why they wouldn't kill another. Jon is supposedly obv town, mafia hate obv town because they are unlynchable. In fact, in a game I am currently playing, I am playing with a person who isn't quite obv town, but is pretty close to the point where they aren't lynchable and the scum is going to have to kill them.<br>\n<br>\nSo, scum hates obv town. ICE =/= obv town, jon = obv town. The only reason they'd decide on ICE over jon is due to the impact in scumhunting.<br>\n<br>\nThis is all my speculation, and I can't guarantee that it is correct, but I have faith that I'm thinking along the correct lines.<br>\n<br>\nGeez I didn't mean for this to be a wall of text, but I guess it is what it is.", "time": "Tue Apr 10, 2012 1:04 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21340&start=700", "forum": "53", "thread": "21340"}

He wasn't here for a decent amount of the time, so it's obvious why there is far less interaction.<br>\nCONCLUSION: Null.<br>\n<br>\nMe:<br>\nI have the second most interaction with Elmo. I did challenge him a few times, but more of it came from DCL. He did mention me a handful of times, and I was consistent with my read, though he interestingly changed reads on me, though it was null and never a big read.<br>\nCONCLUSION: Town (obviously I'm going to say that.)<br>\n<br>\njoker:<br>\nThere is a handful of posts from you, but none by him. You did question him and called him slightly suspicious.<br>\nCONCLUSION: Null.<br>\n<br>\nHaze:<br>\nWell, there was a decent amount of interaction between you. Elmo was kind of all over you near the end, possibly to get an easy lynch.<br>\nCONCLUSION: Null-town<br>\n<br>\nBP:<br>\nLittle interaction, but he did change what he thought of BP, might I add. Changed it from early D1 to late D2, something to take note of.<br>\nCONCLUSION: I actually don't know. BP either needs to get back here or get replaced.<br>\n<br>\njon: <br>\nThere was not too much interaction, same as BP, and his correlation to obv town doesn't do much for me.

You did subtly challenge him once, though never before or after. Very interesting indeed.<br>\nCONCLUSION: Mafia<br>\n<br>\nOkay, let me clarify the above. That is my brief synopsis of each player vs. Elmo. The reads are not my reads, but what I think of their interaction with Elmo.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Viktyr Korimir wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">We should lynch thezmon221 and focus on the lurkers tomorrow.</div> At this point, I have no clue about thezmon221's potential partner(s), but I think BP and Haze are much more likely to be scum than any of Jon, Antihero, or deadjoker.

This post did not catch my eye because he thinks I'm scum, but because of the second part of the bolded. Why do you not want the town to use all the time we have to get the lurkers to talk rather than get a quick lynch? At the very least, we can get BP, and maybe Haze, replaced.

It just doesn't make sense on the town perspective that you'd want to quickly lynch me over getting more interaction between everyone and the lurkers.</div></blockquote>We should by all means <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">examine</div> the lurkers today. We should examine everyone today. But what I've noticed is that you've been close to a lynch every Day-- and then, before you get hammered, there's a sudden shift away from you and a Townie eats rope instead. Now, obviously, I am partially responsible-- because I took my vote off of you for Monkey-- but I think scum had a hand in it. Someone has been shifting our attention away from you.</div></blockquote>So you'd rather quick-lynch me with the possibility of lynching a townie rather than see if you can make more out of the day and potentially lynch ANOTHER townie? I might be biased, but I fail to see the logic.<br>\n<br>\nExamining the lurkers won't do anything for us. We need to get them to start talking more and we really need to get a lynch right today because we could enter tomorrow in MyLo.<br>\n<br>\nAnd might I add, not once before today have I actually been close to being killed without there being another person close to death. The first day was Monkey, who was lynched in the end. Day two it was joker, and then hoko somehow gets tangled up in a mess he can't get himself out of. Elmo may have instigated that lynch, but it would never have gone through if it wasn't for hoko's poor play. I know I'm going to seem really scummy for this, but you can't blame the scum for derailing us from what you supposedly think is an obv scum lynch. That's because it wasn't the scum's fault entirely, it was the players being lynched and the people who pushed their lynch the most.<br>\n<br>\nVK: I'm still waiting for your case.<br>\n<br>\nPEDIT: Especially this late in the game.

I looked at some of your old games and you are a chronic lurker. Why play this game if you aren't going to post?<br>\n<br>\nI looked at hazes ISO (all 21 posts) and looked at your interaction with Elmo. Haze mentioned Elmo 8 times and half of it was talking about another game the two played together.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, I looked from Elmo's perspective and he mentioned haze 25 times, although some hits were in the same post.  Here is an overview of Elmo mentioning haze:<br>\n<br>\n137 Elmo says haze is being haze (implying Elmo has a decent meta on haze)<br>\n<br>\n141 Elmo mentions a previous game that Elmo and haze played together. Elmo claims he will easily be able to tell if haze is scum (based off solely on meta)<br>\n<br>\n209 another mention of a previous game<br>\n<br>\n252 Elmo says his meta on haze is that he will hang around, pull a clever gambit and get an obv town lynched. (I honestly don't know what to make of this)<br>\n<br>\n409 Elmo calls haze a numb on a log<br>\n<br>\n475 Elmo votes haze. From what I can make of elmos reasoning, Elmo is voting haze for lurking.<br>\n<br>\n488 Elmo calls haze shady and a lurker<br>\n<br>\n504 (here is where it starts to get weird.) To put into context what was going on, a dozen posts before this haze wrote up (492 is the post number) a spirited defense of himself, part of which was yet again referencing another game. Elmos response? A single sentence talking about the other game. (That's it. No further scum hunting done on haze.)<br>\n<br>\n504 (not a typo, this is later in the post) Elmo agrees with haze that monkey was acting scummy and his lunch was justified. (he is agreeing with someone that he has his vote on. Not unheard of, but ... Odd. Very odd.)<br>\n<br>\n572 (it gets even weirder. I suggest everyone go back to this post and read it. Context: haze has a bit of a bandwagon on him.) Elmo <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">defends</div> haze. Says he is worried about the bandwagon. Says haze has been really busy. Calls haze town. (I ... I don't know what to make of this. Elmo still has his vote on haze, I think later Elmo says he forgot where his vote was.)<br>\n<br>\n605 Elmo references hazes 492 post again, again talking about another game they have played together. (very, very weird. Are they speaking in code to each other? )<br>\n<br>\n609 Elmo agrees with haze that Jon is scum. Haze called Jon scum for the way he lynched monkey. Later on in the post, Elmo says that a different haze post is really good and unvotes haze. That post by haze: haze defends his survivalist mentality, complains that everyone thinks Jon is obv town, and asks for people to post why they think Jon is obv town. Haze votes thez, but really wants to lynch Jon. (Remember, Elmo, a scum, is agreeing with haze that Jon and thez are dirty.) in the middle of the post, Elmo attacks Jon for voting haze. Wonders why haze is being targeted for lurking.<br>\n<br>\nAnd that's a wrap.<br>\n<br>\nSo ... Was Elmo buddying haze? Elmo and haze clearly had meta on him, so elmo may have done this to ensure that haze wouldn't scrutiny him much and expose Elmo's scummiest.<br>\n<br>\nOr, is haze a scumbuddy?<br>\n<br>\nAnd while haze and Elmo did their fair share of wagoning against thez, Elmo could have dropped the hammer on thez.

Now, given that he appears to have some insight into player's roles or allegiance, I can see one out of possible four reasons he doesn't share it with the rest of the peeps: a) He doesn't want to get killed by the mafia on Night1, b) He has a power role and plans to use the info to make an informed decision, c) He's mafia or d) It's too early to tell.<br>\n<br>\nNow, given the last posts, my read on him has become a bit shakey (<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Unvote </div>, btw), and I am very insecure on his allegiance. Now, by exclusion of parts: d) is stupid. Townies want to make the best possible lynch, from Day 1 till the end - that's the hole point of the game; a) seems probable, but given his basis on trade-for-trade logic of playing, I am disenclined to this one; c) As I've stated, my scumread is all over the place - he seems inteligent enough not to make a very obvious scum move so soon. That leaves b), which I think is the correct one.  <br>\n<br>\nAs far as I know, scumhunt is done based on direct confrontation - at least that's how I've seen it played. Attack, observe the reaction. I mean, hell, that's why there is RVS! Thezmon, however, seems to keep everything to himself, and I'm not sure I like that very much. Thez, how bout you give a read on everyone so far?<br>\n<br>\nBTW: By \"put you on the stand\", I meant seeing how you dealed with this particular situation, it wasn't meant to see you \"crack under pressure.\"</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nSeems like DC isn't the only one who's interested in thez's role.<br>\n<br>\nDC-BP scumteam....?

That argument is filled with ridiculous amounts of WIFOM. Furthermore Jon is considered widely obvtown so he has the ability to get away with hammering recklessly due to his activity in comparison to the rest of town. Plus at the rate he's going he's bought 2 nights for scum and that's already great (minus the death of Elmo) he's essentially given away 4 kills.

Jon, the meta I told you about is quite straightforward.<br>\n<br>\nI am generally reserved, and do not vote.<br>\n<br>\nI don't generally ask for people to die, because I'm not generally an aggresive player. In this game however the scum seem painfully obvious and yet nobody agrees with my scumreads. I'm either terribly mistaken (which would expalain why I haven't been shot dead yet) or all the super townie looking players are brilliant scum.<br>\n<br>\nAs for voting for you, it's because you told me to back up my arguments with my vote, so I've been putting it where my mouth is.<br>\n<br>\nMoving on. Reading Thez all of his case on Jon is good, especially the part about the kill. Jon is the mostwidely regarded obvtown player. There's actually no sense throwing WIFOM because Jon has done nothing that scum can really get dirt on. Realistically he probably would have been a great kill D1.

This is the second post that is insanely scummy. #704.<br>\nIt's a post that goes \"Hey look at every other player that was also on the major bandwagons with me.\" It's bad logic because even a mislynch wagon requires a majority. Meaning that with every lynch DCL will have other town players that he can blame, because town will always be a majority. This means that Firstly he's trying to divert attention to others, which is bad, and secondly he hasn't actually been able to refute Thez's case on him, being that he's been in the latter segment of every major bandwagon: not too early like a convinced townie, and not too scummy, right at the hammer. Also I'd like to point out that DCL shouldn't have thrown out Thez's wagon because Thez would have been the lynch had Hopo not screwed up. And DCL was on it.<br>\n<br>\nPosting this nao.

This suggests that Jon voted Hopo without really sheeping properly, IE without even reading the cases presented by others before sheeping legitly.

Making the hammer bad.<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3951179#p3951179\" class=\"postlink\">#667</a> Suggests a multitude of things.<br>\n1. He was prodded.<br>\n2. His Hammer was a prod-dodge. What town lurker would vote on a prod dogde? While normal prod dogding may not be productive, Voting while not reading the thread is /counter/-productive. As seen it's helped hammer a VT. this is definitely not town motivated. <br>\n3. He shows no remorse or real surprise in the post about the fact that his vote is actually a hammer. In a micro game by Mykonian (it's lost after the crash) I believed I had hammered somebody on the 12th post by accident I raged for about a page about my stupidity. Or mistake. Jon shows no such expression. Course you could say I'm childish and Jon is a calm and collected adult, but humans are not machines, and if the hammer was unintended there would have been more of a reaction (OH CRAP etc) and it's not as if Jon really read any of the arguments against hopo so he probably didn't believe HOpo was scum anyway.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3964026#p3964026\" class=\"postlink\">723</a> is another one of those posts that last 1 line and say fluff.

At least not for another 2 days, should we be here in that time period.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nSo this flip-flop on haze and insistence on haze being town without any reason seems to me to be an obvious softclaim by thez. It seems clear to me that he wants us to think he is a coplike role.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSecond some other questionable quotes:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Wow. 3 people, 2 scum. Then you will add in me, of course, because I've been acting kind of scummy all game. <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">But trust me, you'll understand why I've done certain scummy things if I'd flipped. </div>Regardless, there's a good chance that at least one of them is scum.</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Doctor (if there is one), you've got some work cut out for you... <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">There are a few good choices to pick, I hope you pick the right one.</div></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nLook at the first underlined quote, a vt would not say that. Look at the second underlined part, a smaller softclaim but still one nonetheless. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">I think it is completely safe to say that Thez is trying softclaim an investigative role. That doesn't mean that he is one, just that he is claiming one.</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nHowever there are multiple reasons I don't think that thez could be a investigative pr.<br>\n<br>\nFirst off, his focusing on deadjoker day two, then jumping off of him day three. A cop is not going to press someone and insist that a person is scum if they haven't investigated them, the switch on joker shows that in day two at least thez's veiw of joker was not set in stone, therefor I think this alone gives strong evidence to thez not being an info role.<br>\n<br>\nSecondly, thez has been flip flopping a lot during day three with his accusations, some of it is from the new info that has come about, but this again does not seem like something a cop would do.<br>\n<br>\nThirdly, his refusal to claim at L-1, obvious, he didn't end up getting lynched, but he was extremely close and only got saved by hoko doing some stupid stuff. If thez had been lynched day two and had flipped cop, deadjoker would have been the primary target day 3, but as I have shown, it is unlikely thez had any info on joker day 2. This again shows that thez is not likley a cop.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">So what we have here is thez clearly softclaiming an info/cop role. Yet from his actions it is likely he is not a cop.</div> If it isn't clear what I am getting at let me make it clear.<br>\n<br>\nI think thez is scum, setting himself up for a potential fakeclaim of cop or something similar. Looking at the situation now, calling haze obvious town likely means that haze is indeed town. But not because thez is cop, but because townspeople respond well to being called town and as we can see haze is now fully on Thez's side.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nA quick recap of the other reasons I suspect thez. [These points have been argued enough already, I'm just bringing them up to recap what has been said]<br>\n<br>\n1. The reaction/rolefishing stuff.<br>\n2. Thez jumping off the monkey wagon when it was still moving, {like he was trying to avoid being on a mislynch}, only jumping back on when pressured to do so.<br>\n3. Thez's twisting of monkey's post 115, as pointed out by deadjoker.<br>\n4. Thez getting adhominem in response to deadjokers attacks.<br>\n5. Thez, terrible initial case on me day three, something he backed off of after I defended myself like he realized how crummy it was.<br>\n<br>\nand of course, the whole soft-claiming stuff that has happened day 3.<br>\n<br>\nMy vote is going back on thez:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote:Thezmon</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAlso, @thez, would you care to expound upon this post:<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=3971631#p3971631\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=3971631#p3971631\" data-post-id=\"3971631\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 800</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=15546\">thezmon221</a> wrote:</cite>DCL seems to be \"losing it\" since he was challenged for asking me whether I was cop or not.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nHow exactly have I been losing it since that?", "time": "Sat Apr 14, 2012 8:13 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21340&start=800", "forum": "53", "thread": "21340"}

The fact that he assumes Thez is softclaiming cop with an innocent on Haze suggests that Haze is unlikely as a partner too. Although I suppose Haze could be a Godfather.

And he's entirely right that the same strategy was being used against him D2, as well. His only mistake is in who was doing the driving, I think.<br>\n<br>\nAs I said above, I'm usually wary of people whose reads don't seem to change from one day to the next, but deadjoker's tunnel vision on Thez doesn't bother me nearly as much as DLC's carefully crafted consistency, because it's really just the one read (Thez drove the wagon on Monkey) that none of the flips so far should have given him any particular reason to change.

The no-lynch stuff at the beginning of day-1<br>\n<br>\nThis has been covered already. This was my first game of forum mafia, in my other mafia experience it was seen as bad to lynch day 1 which was why at first I was for a no-lynch. <br>\n<br>\n3.

The suspicion of elmo's flu post.<br>\n<br>\nIAAUN focuses on one post, and conveniantly ignores a previous exchange between me and elmo.<br>\n<br>\n5. IAAUN argues that my saying monkey's lynch is monkey's fault is a scum tell. IAAUN further argues that I dropped my scum read on monkey.<br>\n<br>\nTwo points against it. If monkey had flipped scum, then yes it would have been his fault as he would have given himself away.<br>\nBut, monkey flipped town. However, he still bore some of the responsibility for the lynch as he did act scummy.<br>\n<br>\nSecondly, IAAUN clearly misquotes me in this point to twist what I am saying. Look in the long version for the proof. The full quote shows my scum read on monkey was still there up to the lynch.<br>\n<br>\n6. IAAUN argues that I telegraphed that I was going to go for deadjoker during day two then followed up regardless of night info. Basically IAAUN is claiming that because my read didn't change I am scum. IAAUN further argues that my reads don't change enough.<br>\n<br>\nFirst, there is nothing wrong with suspecting someone two days in a row. It would be silly to completely swap reads each day.<br>\nSecondly if I was going into day 2 trying to get deadjoker lynched, why would I get off his wagon?<br>\nThirdly, some of my reads have changed. such as ones on Elmo, joker, vik and haze. I don't just change randomly, I have changed based on good reasons.<br>\n<br>\n7. IAAUN doesn't like the fact that I was saying either thez or joker was scum when they were arguing. <br>\n<br>\nIAAUN conveniently neglects the fact that as of day two, joker and thez were my two highest scumreads. I didn't think one of them was scum because of the argument, my reasons existed prior and separate to the spat between them.<br>\n<br>\n8. IAAUN claims I do not want anyone analyzing kondi's death.<br>\n<br>\nFalse, I was asking people to not come up with stupid wifom arguments about night kills. <br>\n<br>\nThere is some other more minor stuff, all of which has already been adressed.

To my knowledge, thez never dropped out of Elmo's \"scum reads\" (as evidenced in this <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3941172#p3941172\" class=\"postlink\">post</a> where Elmo calls him \"null-scum\" with the modifier \"at best\" whatever that means).  Elmo makes a lot of \"anti-thez\" posts, but when the chips were down, he was nowhere to be found on the thez wagon when it came close to a lynch; and not just <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3938750#p3938750\" class=\"postlink\">once</a> but <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3947644#p3947644\" class=\"postlink\">TWICE</a>.  If thez is town, that means Elmo had TWO opportunities to hammer a really active town player and not really receive that much scrutiny for it, as that hammer wouldn't have completely come out of the blue (\"scum heaven\" as deadjoker would say).  This is either really bad scum play from Elmo (which I guess isn't out of the question) or thez isn't really town.<br>\n<br>\n...now, back to the present.  I just spent about an hour looking through thez's ISO and I'm having a really hard time seeing him as scum from his posts.  He might have the occasional scumtell sprinkled here and there (but let's face it, we all do) but in the big picture thez looks pretty earnest about his convictions.

I've had a Town read on DCL most of the game, but his walls of defense have given me pause a few times. <br>\n<br>\nI haven't liked the way joker twists quoted posts to make his points, and his \"active lurking\" doesn't come across as very reassuring. He has less posts than Ice who died a few days (game time obviously) ago.<br>\n<br>\nI still feel IAAUN's reads are artificial, but that could just be because his POV is coming as a replacement this far into the game. As far as \"throwing in the towel\" I'm here til I eat rope, or the fat lady sings. <br>\n<br>\nI will say that with warm weather, and no ISP at our lake lot it's getting harder to set aside time to properly address the game.

Will explain below.<br>\nB) He's scum and knows he can't be NK'd, so just slipped really badly.<br>\n<br>\nOkay... so A would confuse me a bit because he did have votes on him, but I believe it was only one vote. Out of five. IAAUN didn't vote for him until a whole two hours later. This is really why I believe that it could be more a scum slip than an assumption. I don't know about you guys, but in that situation I would say \"even if I get <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">killed</div>...\" not \"even if I get <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">lynched</div>...\" The other problem is that he had done this quite a while ago, when it was VERY far from lynching him.

If they were, DCL would not have pushed a BP lynch, but rather a Haze lynch. To me he just picked a target, and perhaps the one that seemed the scummiest in order to potentially gain towncred, even if it is only a little bit from PLs.<br>\n<br>\nThe fact that IAAUN immediately targeted him could point to an immediate bus, except for the point I already stated.

The whole fabricating lies accusation.</div><br>\n<br>\nBasically thez makes a rather generic accusation towards me at the end of one of his posts that I am fabricating lies. It appears to be just a bunch of rhetoric that he attached to one of his posts so I call him out on it. Thez gives four examples of how he claims I am lying. The irony here is that none of these are examples of lying. I just want to go through all of them and show that.<br>\n<br>\nTo be really explicitly clear. I am referring to thez's first post where he makes the four points, as this is the post he is making to show I am lying.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">1. Thez points out my read change from suggesting a policy lynch on bp to calling IAAUN town.</div><br>\n<br>\nHonestly I'm not even sure what he is trying to get at with this. Ok, I'm accused of changing a read. No real connection to fabricating lies.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">2. Thez doesn't like how I am calling it scummy that he agreed with a point from his top scumread.<br>\n</div><br>\nOk, again, where in this point does thez show I am fabricating lies? He doesn't even quote me for crying out loud.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">3. Third, was the whole backtracking thing.</div><br>\n<br>\nI initially called thez out for backtracking because I misunderstood a post from thez. He pointed out my mistake, and I agreed that he wasn't backtracking. No proof of lying here either.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">4.</div> This one is a little more complicated. Jon, calls me out on changing my read on him. I tell jon that other people have done the same thing and point out thez as an example. <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Thez seems to take offense that I pointed him out and claims that I am deflecting attention off of myself. </div><br>\n<br>\nWell, this isn't an example of lying either, it is an example of alleged deflection, but not an example of lying.<br>\n<br>\nSo thez makes 4 points in order to show that I am fabricating lies and none of them show that. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">2. Secondly, thez is the one doing the lying and twisting and I have actual proof.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">exhibit A: Thez's accusation, \"why is it that me agreeing with one point you have made automatically means I am believing everything you say?\"</div><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4007494#p4007494\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4007494#p4007494\" data-post-id=\"4007494\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 943</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=15546\">thezmon221</a> wrote:</cite>You...

Sometimes you'll reconsider what you initially thought scummy/town and see it the other way.<br>\n<br>\nFor instance: At first sometimes jon's hammer on Monkey (and maybe a bit on hoko) seemed alright because of the reasoning and declaring intent. But some people have already stated that it seems to be at least a slightly scummy trend. Granted, that's not 50 posts, but it's still parallel.<br>\n<br>\nAnother instance: You think things over over the night and decide, \"Hey, he's not actually all that bad of a guy...\" And I'm saying that this is the case before Night Actions are turned in, and even in No Lynch scenarios it has happened.<br>\n<br>\nOh look, yet ANOTHER instance: Legitimate flip-flopping. The first one was a very long time, the second was perhaps with no posts in between, but this one can be with short amounts of posts, or even this amount. I'm not talking about randomly going from one vote to another, I'm talking about being incapable of deciding who is the scummiest of said people (as was the case with me in the beginning, and to a significantly lesser extent right now). In fact, this instance right now, where IAAUN has automatically flipped ship within a few posts.<br>\n<br>\nI'm just stating what I think right now. And may I say another thing now, DCL. If I doubt somebody's scumminess, that doesn't mean I am incapable of thinking they are scum. And I didn't specifically say he was clear-cut scum, or even that it was a strong read. Just that that would be an interaction I'd consider in the event you turn up scum... and maybe if you turn up town.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>deadjoker wrote:</cite>Hi username. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Antihero is obv town.</div> There is a whyivotedthez hole in your last post.

I'm looking for interaction. What is there not to get? It's actually rather uncommon for scum to believe that another scum is their top read. Especially if neither are under a decent amount of heat, and DCL probably doesn't feel much heat at all.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, may I commend you, IAAUN. You talk very little, and in fact haven't talked in almost 2 days. Then, your name gets mentioned a bit, and you \"all of a sudden\" come back, and then vote for me.

It's possible to win that much, or lose that much. It depends on what your niche is in mafia, and how well you perform with said niche. Mine is more of the smaller, themed/normal games. Usually no more than 12-15. I tend to use more meta on the other site than I use here, so I had to make the transition here. So far I'm 2-1 with this game still there. This game could still easily go either way. scum needs 2 Mislynches (or mislynch and no lynch) and we need 2 lynches, or any PRs that we have to get the right targets.<br>\n<br>\nIn regards to stats on hitting scum, the ideal % is AT LEAST 50% when you're playing town. When you're mafia/third-party it doesn't really matter. So, you're not too far off. If we find scum today, that puts us in a phenomenal position tomorrow.

I bring up pure fact, and you go ahead and post 4 posts about how I could be wrong. Super over-reaction. They barely even contain substance, by the way.<br>\n<br>\nN1: I hate obv towns, I'm super paranoid of obv towns. I investigated ICE because I figured that if I knew he was obv town, that would give me a huge sigh of relief. Don't believe me? Go check D2. He's my top town read.<br>\n<br>\nN2: I wanted a lurker. I need to get rid of distractions, and I preferred to find out who I can focus on and who I couldn't. I almost picked Elmo, but I'm glad I didn't.<br>\n<br>\nN3: Something didn't sit right with me about IAAUN. Especially about the whole BW scenario.<br>\n<br>\nN4: I thought you were scum from early D3. The only reason I didn't target you N3 is because I prefer to get the hazy members out of the way later on, though I like to figure out \"obv towns\" in D1 so I make sure I have less misconceptions.<br>\n<br>\nNOW, if you're done being excessively defensive, let me ask you some questions:<br>\n1.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>DCLXVI wrote:</cite>Thez, IAAUN, and mathgirl all need to roleclaim. Figure out how you are going to do it.</div></blockquote>There's a bit of inconsistency here. I didn't comment on it at first because I wanted your reaction to my claim, as I knew it'd probably be harsh, though I didn't imagine it to be this harsh. Firstly, why didn't you ask joker to claim (but he's town anyways)? Secondly, why do you ask the three of us to claim, but refuse to do so yourself? Want to claim a PR but want to make sure no one else does? If I was so ballsy to do such a thing as I did, I'd do a better job of covering my tracks in D3.<br>\n<br>\n2.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>DCLXVI wrote:</cite>I also want to see how his reads have changed each day based on his investigations.</div></blockquote>How about you stop being lazy and go ahead and go check yourself? There's this thing called an \"ISO.\" I'm not doing work for you that I have already stated. I've been rather vocal in my reads, in case you haven't noticed.<br>\n<br>\n3.<br>\nSo, now we get down to something that I thought was scummy before, but shrugged it off because at the time of relevance, I thought you might have been town:<br>\nWhy did you push so hard for a Monkey lynch? Why are you conveniently near the end of EVERY SINGLE LYNCH? Not last, but near the end. I call bullshit on your hoko incidence, I call bullshit on your fake claim, because I know it's fake. I've been rather open with my reads, and I even debriefed after I claimed why I did certain things. Here, let me explain something else for you:<br>\n<br>\n\"Would you do a 1-for-1?\"<br>\n<br>\nSo, this is the most debated topic in the game, is it not? It is an extremely scummy move on my part, is it not? Now, let me explain:<br>\n1. I stated I only cared about integrity &amp; reactions. I picked up a lot of reads, and I thought ICE was town, and later investigated to make sure I wasn't being deceived.<br>\n2. I did it for analytical purposes so I can find out who I should/shouldn't investigate.<br>\n3. (most important) I wanted to seem rather scummy in an attempt to not die after D1. I was hoping to be lucky enough to find mafia, though I didn't until after D3 ended.<br>\n<br>\n4.<br>\nSo, here's another point:<br>\n<br>\n\"Why did I not push for an IAAUN lynch right there on D4?\"<br>\nBecause I wanted another answer without the risk of dying. It would've been clear I didn't find any other scum at that point, except for the obvious dead Elmo.<br>\n<br>\nNOW, here's something else, this is important, DCL:<br>\n<br>\nIn the event I'm scum and you're town, who's my buddy? I know who your buddy is, and I know that right off the bat IAAUN wanted to bus you since he's a scum replacement. It almost worked, too. However, he backed off far too early.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>DCLXVI wrote:</cite><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">remember day 3.<br>\n<br>\nI said that thez was setting himself up for a fake-claim of cop.</div></div></div></blockquote>Well, you could always look at my record. Am I stupid enough to do such a thing? I didn't want a target painted on my back, so I denied it.

Thez fakeclaimed a guilty on IAAUN and me. This plays right to deadjoker since deadjoker is suspicious of both of the people thez claimed to find guilty.<br>\n<br>\n3. mathgirl quickly jumps on. No way is town going to automatically believe a claim in lylo. This move rings scum to me.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSo the scum killed the one person who was right about them and then framed two of the suspects of one of the remaining townies. They then drive up the wagon and set up deadjoker to make the final mislynch.<br>\n<br>\nIAAUN-you know that thez is fakeclaiming so I'm not worried about you voting for me.<br>\n<br>\ndeadjoker-think before you vote.", "time": "Fri May 18, 2012 4:09 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21340&start=1050", "forum": "53", "thread": "21340"}

Otherwise, I see no reason not to believe what thez is saying. I'm not scum, I'm just following through the logic. As I said earlier, this would be a really risky move for scum to make. To claim cop, you'd basically have to make sure that there are no real cops somehow, dead or alive. It doesn't add up. I realize that I'm just sheeping and \"following the cop,\" but what thez is saying makes sense to me.<br>\n<br>\nOn the flipside, DCL's counterargument amounts to essentially \"You call me scum, you must be a liar!\" I don't see a heck of a lot of a logical argument against DCL being scum.", "time": "Fri May 18, 2012 4:17 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21340&start=1050", "forum": "53", "thread": "21340"}
