(If you are caught doing so, you will be Modkilled). <br>3. Play to your win-condition, if you are caught not playing to your win-condition, you will be Mod-killed and will turn into a Neutral Survivor.<br>4. If you have an ability, you must either PM me a Target or a No Action PM, if you don\u2019t send me a \u201cNo Action\u201d you will be giving up an opportunity to use your ability for the night.<br>5. You must post every 72 hours, failure to do so will result in a prod. You may be given three grace prods but once you reach the fourth prod you will be replaced. Failure to respond to the prod within 24 hours will result in replacement.<br>6. Do not attempt to use any hidden coding, or small text tags, all text must be visible. If you are caught you will be issued a warning, if it happens again you will be mod-killed.<br>7. You must vote with the appropriate tags with either <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Kdowns</span>; <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote:Kdowns</span>.<br>8. You don't have to unvote before you place another vote but it is much appreciated.<br>9. Once a simple majority of votes on a player has been reached a lynch will occur.<br>10. Day deadlines will be 3 weeks.<br>11.If the day deadline has been hit and a majority has not been reached, the player who has the most votes will be lynched. In case of a tie, the person who has hit it first will be lynched.<br>12. Night Phase will last 72 hours, in which you need to send me a PM if you have an ability.<br>13. You may vote to no lynch, and if half the player list agrees, you will not lynch anyone.<br>14. Once you are Killed you may not post at all in the game thread except for one BAH post, that contains no game related content.<br>15. Please Bold all requests for the Mod, so that it will be easier for me to see it.<br>16. If you encounter any problems with the game, please message me in private.<br>17. Prods will be issued every 72 hours, if I have missed someone that needs to be prodded please tell me.<br>18. If you are going to be missing for more than 48 hours please tell me ahead of time.<br><br><br>Sample Town PM:<br>Player XXX, you are a <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanillia Townie</span>.

Do not get caught up in this fallacy.</div></blockquote>Yes. I never said that someone being aggressive is pro-town, just that you always want to keep people on their toes. Try to put pressure on people as that is probably one of the most effective ways of catching scum.

There were a quite a few people who didn't even have a chance to give a reaction.</div></blockquote>In complete honesty, I didn't realize it was only 2 hours. I thought that it was doing little for me and once I proclaimed it was a reaction question, I was getting a lot more content. I guess some people just didn't read it or didn't consider it.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>However, I think he was actually role-fishing with the 1-1 question and pulled out quick when people called him out on it. <br><br>Now it is possible that a townie could want to role-fish.

Here are two problems with that.<br>1)\tHe has no reasoning. He didn\u2019t even state anything about rolefishing until Post 32. And that wasn\u2019t even about the original problem; it was about me declaring he\u2019s sheeping.<br>2)\tThis isn\u2019t nearly as concrete as the first, but it still should be accounted for. So I\u2019m going to give you a basic lesson in mafia theory. For newbie mafia players,  it is common  for them to hammer, be 2nd to last to hammer, or be the starter of the BW. MonkeyMan doesn\u2019t strike me as that kind of person. Much more experienced players will definitely mix things up. Taking the 2nd spot is a very common move for players in these categories. However, like I said, it\u2019s not concrete, but it deserves recognition.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3914695#p3914695\" class=\"postlink\">post 34</a>, MonkeyMan576 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>thezmon221 wrote:</cite>But we can't use that as support at the moment.

In fact, it's the most obvious example of anyone twisting words. I'm not entirely sure what he meant by a \"preemptive excuse\", but he doesn't seem to know what he's talking about. I rarely make excuses for anything.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3915191#p3915191\" class=\"postlink\">post 48</a>, MonkeyMan576 wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote: TheZmon221</span><br><br>I still think he's scummy, but I don't want a quick lynch.</div></blockquote>Now here\u2019s where the mafia theory REALLY picks up. Remember what I said before: 2nd spot is a common spot. Now, in Post 45, it is discovered I am at L-1. ICE and deadjoker have commented that a quick lynch is unwise. MonkeyMan is the first to unvote. To me, this is just an attempt to get towncred by being the first to unvote, rather than unvoting when everyone else unvotes. It\u2019s even worse that he should know that a hammer this stupid from a real mafia is suicidal so there\u2019s little risk in that. I\u2019d be a bit more convinced if it was D2 or 3 when there is more risk, but it\u2019s not D2 or 3. It\u2019s D1.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3916698#p3916698\" class=\"postlink\">post 85</a>, MonkeyMan576 wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">FOS: DCLXVI<br></span><br>I agree that no-lynches are almost always bad for town and question DCLXVI's motive's for suggesting it.</div></blockquote>Continuous sheeping of ICE, who in post 79 stated that a No-lynch on D1 was not the best of decisions.

We won't truly know how many can kill until the Night has ended.

The generalization you've made in that post is simply inaccurate. You have to account for other variables such as LyLo vs. MyLo vs. regular. You have to account for amount of deaths, who's died, what day it is, how many people, and how obvious anyone is. On Day 1, there is no question: We are not No-Lynching. A lynch is definitely in our best interests, particularly if it is of someone who we can at least vouch for being scummy, for example, just read my ISO on why I think MonkeyMan is the choice."}

I really can't get any reads off of this guy at the beginning, which is a problem, because I usually get at least a few vibes one way or the other towards town players, who have nothing to hide.

He also really has a thing for pushing players that don't know how to defend themselves (hoko and joker, both obvious newbs), while it's odd that he never really mentions his reasoning for a read on Haze, who also hadn't added much of anything to the game when he posted his reads. He made one post that resembled pushing on Haze, but then dropped the argument completely.

His second post doesn't add up. He obviously took the time to skim the thread and see thezmon's 1v1 talk, so why would he call it an RVS vote? His last two posts seem very much like petty bussing that he could drop at any time easily, and I know he can do better, as I SE'd in his first Newbie game. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> This supports my theory of a ICEninja-Haze scumteam.

However, it also seems like we could really just leave Monkey around for a day or two and see what happens.

My opinions on possible people to lynch go mainly to MonkeyMan and DeadJoker.<br><br>My main reasons for thinking of Deadjoker are tied with his votes. DeadJoker is such a fan of short posts that he himself doesn't seem to be able to back his own votes. My first clue was his out-of-nowhere vote on me, on post  99. I've explain in what way am I a newbie. I backed my votes, I'm sorry if I waited for people to \"validate\" them [/sarcasm] to vote for them. Also, the combination of these explanations accounts for my wishy washyness - it's insecurity. <br>Another out-of-nowhere vote comes in post 256, in which he accuses Thez of being ICE's scumbuddy. As far as I know, it is not unheard of for the seemingly more pro-town players to be scum, but I don't think this here is the case, nor do I believe in the far-fetched explanations he got. That rabbit-out-of-a-tall-hat loses yet more consistency because it persupposes that ICE and Thez would previously know how to get Monkey to out his (pseudo-)PR as soon as he actually did, which is a one in a million chance, specially on Day1. As he himself would say, I'm not drinking that koolaid. <br><br><br>MonkeyMan gets to me because of his persistant deflection strategy. Most times he gets voted, he just either gets a faulty reasoning that provides a valid reason to OMGUS-vote, which is the case, I believe, of post 212. His \"arguments\" are actually only a divergence in gameplay style. When that didn't work he recurred to deflect to someone else, on post 225, attacking his own sheep, Elmo, the only guy that actually got on the DCL proto-bandwagon. When <span style=\"font-style: italic\">that</span> didn't work either... well... let's WIFOM the sons'bitches with a BG role claim. And it worked - there is a great number of posts discussing what to do with this (mis-)info. People, bodyguard is basically a VT, as it is not an investigative or actually protective role - because either way a townie gets killed.<br><br><br>This is what I thought was more important to retain.

I mean, sure, Policy Lynching is bad. But when people are so adamant about a lynch... It ends up helping their cause no matter the flip.

I am not convinced AT ALL that you are telling the truth. What is more plausible is that you were seeking Town Cred. Only the mafia (and cops in Normal) would know if Player X is truly, 100% town. Even then, a cop would only know Y number of people. Some of them may get killed.

I find it interesting y'all are trying to undermine me for a correct read.<br><br>@DCI he wasn't acting scummy. He was targeted by thez early and thez railroaded monkey all day one. Nothing monkey could have said would have stopped the scum driven bandwagon against him, they were pretty confident he was a PR. The name of the game of their strategy to get him lynched being \"where there is smoke there is fire\" which town bit hook line and sinker.  He didn't soft role claim, he telegraphed he would claim if he hit l-1, which he did. Stop focusing on single posts and put the story together, unless you at scum. In which case continue to not do this. As far as him not being polite, that read can be applied to thez and ICE, who are both pretty rude as well. Do you consider them scum for that? And monkey knew he was going to die, so I didn't read too much into his \"screw this \" mentality late game."}

I did vote for Monkey, because, as I said, all the arguments made sense - that is why I voted him. DLC had a great deal of reasons and they all seem to add up.

DCL and Thez seemed to be pushing a wee bit too hard on him, insisting on his lynching, when the whole of the players had both players in mind - Monkey and Joker. They seemed to push for Monkey. But then again, that could be explained by the scum act - I am very uncertain about them... As I said, they dropped a few points on my town radar, but... who knows?<br><br>Joker - I had made a case on him before, already, mainly given a) His always very assured assumptions and b) His constant flips on his assured assumptions. He claims something with certainty, and later he completely denies the former and comes up with an entirely new theory - the thez/ICE conspiracy theory comes to mind. But then again, he <span style=\"font-style: italic\">was</span> right about Monkey - I'm simply wondering if he had any \"safe\" information or if that was one of his short-lived 100%certain theories. <br><br>Then there is hokorippoi, who is now much more active, because he doesn't do well on Day1's, apparently.

All the reasons for him being scummy yesterday still hold (and now he's V/LA, great <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_igmeou.gif\" alt=\":igmeou:\" title=\"IGMEOU\">).</div></blockquote>Completely agree.

If there are multiple kills, alright sure it's worth looking to see if there are more likely multiple scum teams, a vig, or an SK, but if it's just a single night kill on a town player, leave it at that. There are 3 reasons scum kill a specific player, be it because they'll be difficult to mislynch, because they look like a PR, or because they have a view that needs to disappear. You cannot assume which one it is, and trying to figure it out only distracts from real scum hunting."}

Meaning we should ISO him and treat the other current town leaders ICE and Thez with suspicion (IE if 1st was true, then we need check his reads, and if 2nd were true then it doesn't make sense for ICE/Thez who seemed more pro-town to not be shot.) Of course he could be killed purely because another player hated him. But that's a rather illogical move. Ok. whatever. Wifom. Just a thought. Also shit ignore this part lol. Yeha Kondi isn't an easy mislynch, as opposed to me in my current position. Editing this chunk again, (more thoughts) wonder if Kondi was offed just for coming up with a way to use a claimed bodyguard effectively. I think of this as I read thez's 464 where he claims that Monkey was a major distraction and that offing him was a good idea/policy. I think that if we kept Monkey he would essentially have been a nice meat sheild. Thus I consider whether or not Thez's justification has scummy motivations: Why would you ever dismiss a town PR's usefulness to town? only when you're afraid real town would realise. I also think that at any given point if people think a Lynchee is town then they shouldn't be lynched regardless of what position they may be in. I think that nobody who decided to lynch Monkey after his claim anyway can really justify their actions.<br><br>Also as a response to 451 Thez being pissed about me not posting: you guys lynched him quite quickly before I really had a chance to say anything, and by the time day 2 was back up camp had come along.<br><br>Annddd the rest of the thread is speculation on how strong a read a Lurking should attribute to scummyness.<br><br>Well there's not much for me to say other than explain my situation. Fri-Sun was camp. monday was exam. Monday night I was catching up on the gargantum 26 player game that I was too many pages behind on.

Even if we knew at that point of him being a BG he was still presenting massive scum tells.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>deadjoker wrote:</cite>When monkey was asked to explain his PR he responded with \"go read the wiki.\" The response was \"OMG scum!\" and he got buried for it. The weak line of thinking being if he can't post his own description of the PR role he is scum. Bull. If he was pretending he would have researched the role to understand it, i dont think anyone would be that complete of a newbie.  In other words, scum was manufacturing the tell.</div></blockquote>I don't know if you are referring to me, but both jon (I think?) and I asked him the grounds of his role in an attempt to trap him. By this I mean we wanted to out him as scum if he was lying based on the circumstances of his roles as this is a normal game and there are restrictions.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Another person asked what a hydra is a few pages back and thez posted \"go read the wiki\" and no one noticed. Now while the circumstances are different, the point I'm trying to make is that is how scum creates smoke. They make sure every post by their target is portrayed in a scummy light. Thez isn't on the agenda, thus no smoke.</div></blockquote>I actually originally posted that because I had forgotten what the true definition was and didn't want to misguide them, but intended on going to read the wiki myself. I was busy and wanted to get out a post quickly, so it was also to help me remember to go back to the wiki. Regardless, the two circumstances are very different and I have no problem with this coming in the light."}

I didn't take anything out of context. Sure, I looked at it in-depth, but did not take out of context.<br>But that WASN'T the reason he unvoted me.

I never said that my reaction fish was \u201csuper awesome\u201d, but rather that it helped us get some discussion, which is true. I dismissed nothing that Monkey said, I only accused him of ad hominem which is something that mafia can do if they get frustrated.

It was only a matter of time before the hammer was dropped.</div></blockquote>The reason it was considered scummy is because hesitation to name your circumstances would mean you\u2019re hiding something. Someone who has a legitimate PR would be able to name all of their circumstances no problem unless they compromised another person. His role compromised nobody but himself. So, he shouldn\u2019t have had to hesitate if he was sincere.<br>Everything he said was shot down because it did nothing to help him.

You fail to see all factors that go into an argument and only refer to what you can defend against. We are referring to all of your posts, starting with you asking how scummy ICE thinks Monkey is all throughout this post and such.

Which is why you jumped and jumped back. Very well, I have no case.<br>At the time, who did you think was scummier?

I understand that you may be legitimately looking for scum... but three times you appear very close to the end? It might be a fluke, it might not be. Third-to-last on the final lynches though? With VK following the hoko and jon hammering? There's a few questions regarding that.<br><br>Also relating to the hoko lynch, I checked your ISO just to see what sort of circumstances there were, and you didn't reflect too much on why you wanted to lynch hoko. Sure, you made a few statements, but that was about 20 hours before and then, once again, you conveniently place yourself at the second-to-last.<br><br>Why you might be linked to <span class=\"noboldsig\">Elmo</span>: Well, the points you stated do, as I said before, very little for me.

A bandwagon was forming, Elmo voted again because he apparently forgot he voted before. You vote for hoko to put him at L-1, but really he's at L-2. VK goes to lay the hammer conveniently, but then everyone realizes that Elmo voted to put him at L-3. To me, this seems like an attempt by Elmo to mask the two of you with confusion.<br><br>Why you might be linked to <span class=\"noboldsig\">jon</span>: You have conveniently been third-to-last on both final lynches, jon has been the hammer. In the occasion of monkey, he did declare intent, but he hammered early. In the event of hoko, he waltzed in and hammered after I had already declared intent, and that is a much, much more obvious attempt to quick-hammer hoko.<br><br>Either way, I can see links between you, but I don't see as many links between VK and jon as the two with you, which is why I'm settling on you for now. There is probably a pretty decent chance of me switching votes again because the three of you oscillate in position, but you seem to be the most solid of the three for now and I'm going to have to observe more 1-on-1 interactions as we have...8 people left, which means that scum makes up 1/4-3/8 of the group.<br><br>I'm probably going to get a lot of flak for this statement, but remember guys: there <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">could</span></span></span> be a total of 4 scum. We did start with 12 people, so that would make up exactly 1/3 of the game, which is a good balance, but there could be 3 scum which would be at a ratio of 1/4, which is also an optimal balance. For now I'm hoping that there are just 2 more scum because that will make our jobs much easier.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>DCLXVI wrote:</cite>@thez, hm, your read on me seems to have changed a lot, could you perhaps provide a little more detail as to why you now think I'm scum?</div></blockquote>And that's the beauty of when you have a kill you can actually analyze.

However, I'm also inclined to believe the opportunity that DCL had misguided you in an attempt to pull you over to a hoko bandwagon.

In fact, I'd go so far as to say I'm quite possibly the most hated person in this game (on a game level, not personal) because of how I've played all game from the reaction-fish to Monkey's lynch to the big debate with joker. It doesn't take a genius to realize I've been acting scummy to many people.<br><br>Now, on to my point, D2 there was a big debate between joker and me. We both took a TON of flak, but now both are alive. Why? Because hoko comes out of nowhere with questionable posts. What I think is that the scum, being Elmo and DCL (I haven't decided who else) decided to try to get a lynch on a person who won't cause as much noise. This would also explain why Elmo didn't hammer me yesterday as I expected he would. The two (and their third buddy) flipped the ship VERY effectively, killing hoko who was always quiet and never did much. The quoted just below helps solidify that reasoning:<br><blockquote><div><cite>deadjoker wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>deadjoker wrote:</cite>It's not WIFOM.

Hoko helped him out by posting extremely weirdly which made it easy to get momentum on him.</div></blockquote><br><br>Going into the night, I instantly knew that joker and I are unkillable (assuming joker is also town) due to the amount of commotion we've caused. Killing ICE was probably one of their best bets, either him or jon (assuming jon is town).<br><br>That is partly why I also question jon's alignment. Why would they decide to kill ICE over jon? I can only think of two reasons.<br>1) jon is scum.<br>2) jon (assuming town) doesn't contribute as much to scumhunting as ICE does.<br><br>#1 makes slightly more sense to me because if he's town, then he's been obv town all game long. ICE was far from obv town to anyone but me and maybe one or two other people.<br><br>You see, this is where me being 8-1 as a mafia comes into play. I might have more than double the games as a town, but I can think like mafia. I'm pretty insightful when it comes to things like that, though my questions are usually pretty hypothetical and occasionally filled with WIFOM. But, back to my point, #2 just doesn't make as much sense in my eyes. Due to experience as scum, I can think of reasons why a scum would want to kill a person, and why they wouldn't kill another. Jon is supposedly obv town, mafia hate obv town because they are unlynchable. In fact, in a game I am currently playing, I am playing with a person who isn't quite obv town, but is pretty close to the point where they aren't lynchable and the scum is going to have to kill them.<br><br>So, scum hates obv town. ICE =/= obv town, jon = obv town. The only reason they'd decide on ICE over jon is due to the impact in scumhunting.<br><br>This is all my speculation, and I can't guarantee that it is correct, but I have faith that I'm thinking along the correct lines.<br><br>Geez I didn't mean for this to be a wall of text, but I guess it is what it is."}

I don't think my vote had much of an effect towards Viktyr.</div></blockquote>I meant for that to say \"may have misled...\" rather than a definite one-way, apologies.<br><br>Okay, let me see what I think of post 720 relating to the people.<br><br>DCL:<br>I'm going to go ahead and just say there was a lot of interaction between you. Reading more thoroughly between the two, it actually seems too obvious to be bussing and a lot more pro-town.<br>CONCLUSION: Town.<br><br>Antihero:<br>There is very little I can say about Antihero. He wasn't here for a decent amount of the time, so it's obvious why there is far less interaction.<br>CONCLUSION: Null.<br><br>Me:<br>I have the second most interaction with Elmo. I did challenge him a few times, but more of it came from DCL.

You did question him and called him slightly suspicious.<br>CONCLUSION: Null.<br><br>Haze:<br>Well, there was a decent amount of interaction between you. Elmo was kind of all over you near the end, possibly to get an easy lynch.<br>CONCLUSION: Null-town<br><br>BP:<br>Little interaction, but he did change what he thought of BP, might I add. Changed it from early D1 to late D2, something to take note of.<br>CONCLUSION: I actually don't know. BP either needs to get back here or get replaced.<br><br>jon: <br>There was not too much interaction, same as BP, and his correlation to obv town doesn't do much for me.

You did subtly challenge him once, though never before or after. Very interesting indeed.<br>CONCLUSION: Mafia<br><br>Okay, let me clarify the above. That is my brief synopsis of each player vs. Elmo. The reads are not my reads, but what I think of their interaction with Elmo.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Viktyr Korimir wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">We should lynch thezmon221 and focus on the lurkers tomorrow.</span> At this point, I have no clue about thezmon221's potential partner(s), but I think BP and Haze are much more likely to be scum than any of Jon, Antihero, or deadjoker. (Except that if it <span class=\"noboldsig\">is</span> deadjoker, and torpedoing his own theory was a gambit, I will bet DCLXVI is his partner.)</div></blockquote>Okay... This post did not catch my eye because he thinks I'm scum, but because of the second part of the bolded. Why do you not want the town to use all the time we have to get the lurkers to talk rather than get a quick lynch? At the very least, we can get BP, and maybe Haze, replaced. It just doesn't make sense on the town perspective that you'd want to quickly lynch me over getting more interaction between everyone and the lurkers.<br><br>Hey VK, I'd like to hear why you think I'm scum too. And I'd like to hear something other than \"rolefishing is scummy hurr-de-hurr\".

Haze haze haze, you need to get yourself into this game.  I looked at some of your old games and you are a chronic lurker. Why play this game if you aren't going to post?<br><br>I looked at hazes ISO (all 21 posts) and looked at your interaction with Elmo. Haze mentioned Elmo 8 times and half of it was talking about another game the two played together.<br><br>However, I looked from Elmo's perspective and he mentioned haze 25 times, although some hits were in the same post.  Here is an overview of Elmo mentioning haze:<br><br>137 Elmo says haze is being haze (implying Elmo has a decent meta on haze)<br><br>141 Elmo mentions a previous game that Elmo and haze played together. Elmo claims he will easily be able to tell if haze is scum (based off solely on meta)<br><br>209 another mention of a previous game<br><br>252 Elmo says his meta on haze is that he will hang around, pull a clever gambit and get an obv town lynched. (I honestly don't know what to make of this)<br><br>409 Elmo calls haze a numb on a log<br><br>475 Elmo votes haze. From what I can make of elmos reasoning, Elmo is voting haze for lurking.<br><br>488 Elmo calls haze shady and a lurker<br><br>504 (here is where it starts to get weird.) To put into context what was going on, a dozen posts before this haze wrote up (492 is the post number) a spirited defense of himself, part of which was yet again referencing another game. Elmos response? A single sentence talking about the other game. (That's it. No further scum hunting done on haze.)<br><br>504 (not a typo, this is later in the post) Elmo agrees with haze that monkey was acting scummy and his lunch was justified. (he is agreeing with someone that he has his vote on. Not unheard of, but ... Odd. Very odd.)<br><br>572 (it gets even weirder. I suggest everyone go back to this post and read it. Context: haze has a bit of a bandwagon on him.) Elmo <span style=\"font-style: italic\">defends</span> haze. Says he is worried about the bandwagon. Says haze has been really busy. Calls haze town. (I ... I don't know what to make of this. Elmo still has his vote on haze, I think later Elmo says he forgot where his vote was.)<br><br>605 Elmo references hazes 492 post again, again talking about another game they have played together. (very, very weird. Are they speaking in code to each other? )<br><br>609 Elmo agrees with haze that Jon is scum. Haze called Jon scum for the way he lynched monkey. Later on in the post, Elmo says that a different haze post is really good and unvotes haze. That post by haze: haze defends his survivalist mentality, complains that everyone thinks Jon is obv town, and asks for people to post why they think Jon is obv town. Haze votes thez, but really wants to lynch Jon. (Remember, Elmo, a scum, is agreeing with haze that Jon and thez are dirty.) in the middle of the post, Elmo attacks Jon for voting haze. Wonders why haze is being targeted for lurking.<br><br>And that's a wrap.<br><br>So ... Was Elmo buddying haze? Elmo and haze clearly had meta on him, so elmo may have done this to ensure that haze wouldn't scrutiny him much and expose Elmo's scummiest.<br><br>Or, is haze a scumbuddy?<br><br>And while haze and Elmo did their fair share of wagoning against thez, Elmo could have dropped the hammer on thez. Haze interestingly enough had his vote on thez even when thez was at l-1.<br><br>Pedit whelp I have a lot of catching up to do."}

That argument is filled with ridiculous amounts of WIFOM. Furthermore Jon is considered widely obvtown so he has the ability to get away with hammering recklessly due to his activity in comparison to the rest of town. Plus at the rate he's going he's bought 2 nights for scum and that's already great (minus the death of Elmo) he's essentially given away 4 kills.

Reading Thez all of his case on Jon is good, especially the part about the kill. Jon is the mostwidely regarded obvtown player. There's actually no sense throwing WIFOM because Jon has done nothing that scum can really get dirt on. Realistically he probably would have been a great kill D1. But strangely they shot Kondi, who is supposedly known to flake and is quite a viable mis-policy-lynch.<br><br>And then there's DCL. This is the second post that is insanely scummy. #704.<br>It's a post that goes \"Hey look at every other player that was also on the major bandwagons with me.\" It's bad logic because even a mislynch wagon requires a majority. Meaning that with every lynch DCL will have other town players that he can blame, because town will always be a majority. This means that Firstly he's trying to divert attention to others, which is bad, and secondly he hasn't actually been able to refute Thez's case on him, being that he's been in the latter segment of every major bandwagon: not too early like a convinced townie, and not too scummy, right at the hammer. Also I'd like to point out that DCL shouldn't have thrown out Thez's wagon because Thez would have been the lynch had Hopo not screwed up. And DCL was on it.<br><br>Posting this nao.

Your actions suggest that not only did you know there was a wagon on Hopo, you also decided it would be good to follow the wagon. <br>#660 feels like you know that you're hammering &amp; that you know exactly what's going on, regardless of flu or not.<br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3951120#p3951120\" class=\"postlink\">661</a> consists of fluff I was talking about earlier.<br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3951140#p3951140\" class=\"postlink\">664</a> suggests that he didn't see Thez's intent to hammer. Meaning he probably didnt' read the thread that carefully. This suggests that Jon voted Hopo without really sheeping properly, IE without even reading the cases presented by others before sheeping legitly. (By legit I mean reading a case &amp; agreeing, &amp; in turn voting with the majority.) Making the hammer bad.<br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3951179#p3951179\" class=\"postlink\">#667</a> Suggests a multitude of things.<br>1. He was prodded.<br>2. His Hammer was a prod-dodge. What town lurker would vote on a prod dogde? While normal prod dogding may not be productive, Voting while not reading the thread is /counter/-productive. As seen it's helped hammer a VT. this is definitely not town motivated. <br>3. He shows no remorse or real surprise in the post about the fact that his vote is actually a hammer. In a micro game by Mykonian (it's lost after the crash) I believed I had hammered somebody on the 12th post by accident I raged for about a page about my stupidity. Or mistake. Jon shows no such expression. Course you could say I'm childish and Jon is a calm and collected adult, but humans are not machines, and if the hammer was unintended there would have been more of a reaction (OH CRAP etc) and it's not as if Jon really read any of the arguments against hopo so he probably didn't believe HOpo was scum anyway.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3964026#p3964026\" class=\"postlink\">723</a> is another one of those posts that last 1 line and say fluff. It's a healthy post count though.<br><br>[http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3964194#p3964194]724[/url]<br><br>Jon, by and large was in an unshakeable conftown position. And the argument given in the post fails because scum has to think relatively rather than absolutely. ICE was a far easier lynch, Jon a far more difficult one. It's the very reason I'm still alive. Heh.<br><br>The rest of the post relating to consipracy theory seems more a debunking of Thez's case rather than a solid defence against it. IE HEH what a JOKE, just like DeadJOKER? Geddit? hahahahhaha<br>Yeah sorry that was weird. And yeah with regards to my point about how Jon didn't react much emotionally<br><br>[quote=jon]If you don't think the way you feel can effect the way you post, you are lying to yourself.[/quote]<br><br>I couldn't agree with this more. If jon was sick/confused, then he should have acted that way. All he did was a hammer, and there is no confusion or remorse apparent in 667.<br><br>As for the rest of his ISO I don't actually know what to say about his case on ISO. I'd have to read Antihero too but ATM Antihero seems town so I'll just disregard it. At least Jon is scumhunting in those posts.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3969591#p3969591\" class=\"postlink\">#770</a><br><br>Make a strong case against me that isn't based on me not posting. /I'm/ Asking for it.</div></div></div><br><br>I nearly gave a BP analysis here, until I realised there's practically nothing in it.<br><br>Almost all of his posts suggest that there /may/ be scum somewhere, and his scumreads /may/ be correct.

This means that Firstly he's trying to divert attention to others, which is bad, and secondly he hasn't actually been able to refute Thez's case on him, being that he's been in the latter segment of every major bandwagon: not too early like a convinced townie, and not too scummy, right at the hammer.

I truly believe Haze isn't scum, and I will not be voting for him... At least not for another 2 days, should we be here in that time period.</div></blockquote><br><br>So this flip-flop on haze and insistence on haze being town without any reason seems to me to be an obvious softclaim by thez. It seems clear to me that he wants us to think he is a coplike role.<br><br><br>Second some other questionable quotes:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Wow. 3 people, 2 scum. Then you will add in me, of course, because I've been acting kind of scummy all game. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">But trust me, you'll understand why I've done certain scummy things if I'd flipped. </span>Regardless, there's a good chance that at least one of them is scum.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Doctor (if there is one), you've got some work cut out for you... <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">There are a few good choices to pick, I hope you pick the right one.</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Look at the first underlined quote, a vt would not say that. Look at the second underlined part, a smaller softclaim but still one nonetheless. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">I think it is completely safe to say that Thez is trying softclaim an investigative role. That doesn't mean that he is one, just that he is claiming one.</span><br><br><br>However there are multiple reasons I don't think that thez could be a investigative pr.<br><br>First off, his focusing on deadjoker day two, then jumping off of him day three. A cop is not going to press someone and insist that a person is scum if they haven't investigated them, the switch on joker shows that in day two at least thez's veiw of joker was not set in stone, therefor I think this alone gives strong evidence to thez not being an info role.<br><br>Secondly, thez has been flip flopping a lot during day three with his accusations, some of it is from the new info that has come about, but this again does not seem like something a cop would do.<br><br>Thirdly, his refusal to claim at L-1, obvious, he didn't end up getting lynched, but he was extremely close and only got saved by hoko doing some stupid stuff. If thez had been lynched day two and had flipped cop, deadjoker would have been the primary target day 3, but as I have shown, it is unlikely thez had any info on joker day 2. This again shows that thez is not likley a cop.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">So what we have here is thez clearly softclaiming an info/cop role. Yet from his actions it is likely he is not a cop.</span> If it isn't clear what I am getting at let me make it clear.<br><br>I think thez is scum, setting himself up for a potential fakeclaim of cop or something similar. Looking at the situation now, calling haze obvious town likely means that haze is indeed town. But not because thez is cop, but because townspeople respond well to being called town and as we can see haze is now fully on Thez's side.<br><br><br>A quick recap of the other reasons I suspect thez. [These points have been argued enough already, I'm just bringing them up to recap what has been said]<br><br>1. The reaction/rolefishing stuff.<br>2. Thez jumping off the monkey wagon when it was still moving, {like he was trying to avoid being on a mislynch}, only jumping back on when pressured to do so.<br>3. Thez's twisting of monkey's post 115, as pointed out by deadjoker.<br>4. Thez getting adhominem in response to deadjokers attacks.<br>5. Thez, terrible initial case on me day three, something he backed off of after I defended myself like he realized how crummy it was.<br><br>and of course, the whole soft-claiming stuff that has happened day 3.<br><br>My vote is going back on thez:<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote:Thezmon</span><br><br><br><br>Also, @thez, would you care to expound upon this post:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3971631#p3971631\" class=\"postlink\">post 800</a>, thezmon221 wrote:</cite>DCL seems to be \"losing it\" since he was challenged for asking me whether I was cop or not.</div></blockquote><br><br>How exactly have I been losing it since that?"}

I think I was referring to how we didn't know who really was who, so it was more-or-less a messed up way of saying \"Pick a target, and lynch the other based on their flip,\" but in this case, you lynched the cop first and then needed to lynch the mafia.<br><br>Thirdly, I know exactly how you feel. It's not troll logic meta, because as I said before, I had no clue what I was thinking at the time of the writing, but I have a habit of playing in a way where I don't necessarily spark one way or another among players. I tend to sometimes be in-your-face.<br><br>Fourthly, I have to agree with a decent amount of your ISO.

I read all posts and took them into consideration. The reason I said 99% was because things could still change. After the BG claim I was skeptical of both sides, but unsure of what to do, so I went through with the lynch, especially after reading some of his last posts.<br><br>Now, I'd like it if other players came back and voiced their opinion as well, because we need to get this game running again so we can finish it.

Those are really good chances for the town.. unless the scum is a wizard (as in awesomely amazing at playing).<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>kdowns wrote:</cite><span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vote Count:<br>thezmon221-   DCLXVI,<br>deadjoker - <br>jon_h61- Haze, <br>iamausername-jon_h61,<br>AntiHero- <br>DCLXVI- Antihero, iamausername , deadjoker ,<br>Haze- <br>Viktyr Korimir - </span></span></div></blockquote>Did jon ever vote for IAAUN?

I don't see either of them as particularly scummy. What I thought was good was that IAAUN quickly went and read everything, then posted some evaluations within 3 days (I believe?) and definitely isn't trying to hide. If scum is replaced, it's just more common for them to fly under the radar, especially the later it is in the game.

Before I make a more formal read (being more accurate), I'm going to need to see more coming from him. He's only just replaced, so I'm going to give time for him to post more, and for interactions with other people (like myself and DCL) to... \"come alive\" for lack of a better term. He may have reads now, but they are based on earlier posts, so the true test for him will be these interactions with the other players."}

There was very little reason to ask if I was a cop anyway. If you were so convinced I was a cop, then you shouldn't have said anything and gone along with whatever, but instead you asked.

Switches to a \"lurker\" Haze vote in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3931074#p3931074\" class=\"postlink\">475</a>.  Then the switch to hoko.  And that's it.  To my knowledge, thez never dropped out of Elmo's \"scum reads\" (as evidenced in this <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3941172#p3941172\" class=\"postlink\">post</a> where Elmo calls him \"null-scum\" with the modifier \"at best\" whatever that means).  Elmo makes a lot of \"anti-thez\" posts, but when the chips were down, he was nowhere to be found on the thez wagon when it came close to a lynch; and not just <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3938750#p3938750\" class=\"postlink\">once</a> but <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3947644#p3947644\" class=\"postlink\">TWICE</a>.  If thez is town, that means Elmo had TWO opportunities to hammer a really active town player and not really receive that much scrutiny for it, as that hammer wouldn't have completely come out of the blue (\"scum heaven\" as deadjoker would say).  This is either really bad scum play from Elmo (which I guess isn't out of the question) or thez isn't really town.<br><br>...now, back to the present.  I just spent about an hour looking through thez's ISO and I'm having a really hard time seeing him as scum from his posts.  He might have the occasional scumtell sprinkled here and there (but let's face it, we all do) but in the big picture thez looks pretty earnest about his convictions.  The thing with Elmo is still nagging at me, though (just because of its importance)."}

Basically, my point to get across here is that after evaluation of this, jon is really the only person we could hold anything against using this analysis due to his wagons. HOWEVER, that's not even enough. You have to look at his motives. I'm sure we all know the whole story, so I'm not going to restate it unless someone seriously wants me to.<br><br>It's also interesting to note that jon is also near the end of both the Thez and the joker lynch. Not much more to say on that topic, TBH. These are simply the kinds of things that will keep oscillating my votes. I'd be happy with either a DCL or jon lynch, as I feel at least one of them is mafia. Jon for his sketchy voting patterns and under-the-radar behavior, and DCL for... well he occasionally over reacts to comments and gets defensive, but also his... rolefish question.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>jon_h61 wrote:</cite>In an aside, I read somewhere in Mafia Discussion that pretending to lose interest late in the game is a viable scum strategy.</div></blockquote>Aren't you supposed to be trying to defend yourself?

You said nothing about the softclaiming until after you were hit for it by Antihero, and then myself. After that, you created something that seems it could have been easily fabricated to try to get you out of a rut, though it won't work."}

Will explain below.<br>B) He's scum and knows he can't be NK'd, so just slipped really badly.<br><br>Okay... so A would confuse me a bit because he did have votes on him, but I believe it was only one vote. Out of five. IAAUN didn't vote for him until a whole two hours later. This is really why I believe that it could be more a scum slip than an assumption. I don't know about you guys, but in that situation I would say \"even if I get <span style=\"font-style: italic\">killed</span>...\" not \"even if I get <span style=\"font-style: italic\">lynched</span>...\" The other problem is that he had done this quite a while ago, when it was VERY far from lynching him. We were focused more on DCL, and he just stops. Why?<br><br>I'm also going to echo both joker and Haze in saying his AtE responses are just adding to the fire.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>deadjoker wrote:</cite>Also DCL, you posted about lynching BPs replacement, I stated that it was a bad idea, and you reiterated your desire to lynch BPs replacement anyway. That struck me as kind of weird, and was almost like you were attempting to start an early bandwagon on the new guy cause you were pissed that town might get an active player instead the lump and no vote that was BP.<br><br>However, username immediately targeted you, I don't know what to make of that. He did make a very good case against you.</div></blockquote>If the two of them were scumbuddies, I wouldn't know what to do with myself. I honestly don't think IAAUN and DCL are scum together. If they were, DCL would not have pushed a BP lynch, but rather a Haze lynch. To me he just picked a target, and perhaps the one that seemed the scummiest in order to potentially gain towncred, even if it is only a little bit from PLs.<br><br>The fact that IAAUN immediately targeted him could point to an immediate bus, except for the point I already stated. It looks like IAAUN was just making an analysis of each player, and that was one of the things that came up."}

I'm just not going to waste a lot of time defending myself. If you haven't noticed I haven't defended anyone. I've tried to find scum. If I was scum, I would have voted Thez or joker when they were both at -1, but at those moments in time I wasn't convinced they were scum. Instead of analyzing the little things people point out as \"scummie\", take a look at my play all the way through the game. Then decide if I deserve to be lynched. Take this however you want, I'm not scum.<br><br>But personally if we're getting close to a LYLO, I wouldn't want me around, cuz I have no  clue who the scum are ATM. I've spent hours and hours reading the thread again and again, and reading ISO's and  I'd still be guessing. The bad part of PBPAs people only look for scummie things. They paint the pictures they want to see with predujice. Then there are the scum, they want Town to look guilty. I will refute points I feel are being misrepresented, but if it's things I've actually screwed up and done, then those things have no defense and I'll take the blame for them.

Sure you want to stay alive, but I think he is taking it to extremes. There are far less scum, so they can't aford to lose even one. I was going to place a vote on him, but he went v/la, and I feel that would be bad form in any circumstance.<br><br>I'm still unsure of IAAUN, if he'd post more maybe I might change my view of him.

When joker and Thez were going strong at it I was undecisive and stayed away from that wagon. He posts just enough content to stay off people's radar. He has several fluff posts, which isn't bad in itself, but add it to his low post count, and it starts to look worse. All that said, he's low on my suspect list. <br><br>As for you (Haze), your early game play screams scum to me. Your game play changed when I came on strong for you, and I'm glad for that. Why not look for scum seriously earlier in the game? Everybody has their own play style I guess. Maybe?? you're trying to disarm scum by not looking like a threat? I have to believe you're Town, or all my theories go down the toilet. Time will tell. <br><br>The reason I seem so indecisive ATM I've been wrong three confirmed times so far, and maybe more.

Then one comment saying I was suspicious of him and next thing I'm by far the scummiest player here. His excuse for finding me this scummie in post 918 is weak too. Notice that it wasn't that bad until after I commented that he was a suspect.

The whole fabricating lies accusation.</span><br><br>Basically thez makes a rather generic accusation towards me at the end of one of his posts that I am fabricating lies. It appears to be just a bunch of rhetoric that he attached to one of his posts so I call him out on it. Thez gives four examples of how he claims I am lying.

He doesn't even quote me for crying out loud.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">3.

He pointed out my mistake, and I agreed that he wasn't backtracking. No proof of lying here either.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">4.</span> This one is a little more complicated. Jon, calls me out on changing my read on him.

I felt that Monkey was scum, and even if he wasn't, scum would have a heyday with anything he said casting doubt over the whole issue.

I did, and yes you do call for rope a lot, without voting.<br><br>As far as the questions you posed in your ISO of me in post 790, what good would ranting about my mistake have done. You would have said it was artificial in your ISO instead. A Reader's Digest version of what happened: The last I had read Thez was at -1, when I came back I wanted to post something, then leave. I skimmed the last page and voted, not thinking it could have gotten that many votes that quickly. Even if I was scum, if I had read the posts leading up to the lynch, I would have LET Thez take the hammer. The bad thing, I was reading a game where someone hammered, then said he didn't realise the person was at -1 not all that long before I stupidly did it. ATT I remember thinking yeah he's definitely scum trying to cover up an easy lynch. (Never did go back and find out if he was or not). As to my \"limited skimmimg\", Hoko had been on my radar for awhile. And no I don't know how to \"sheep properly\".

I was saying the words \"@ Monkey I'll believe you for now\" that you said strike me as suspect because you're anticipating your own change of opinion, and I don't think people do that with real opinions. <br><br>Town players change their opinions in response to new information.

It's possible to win that much, or lose that much. It depends on what your niche is in mafia, and how well you perform with said niche. Mine is more of the smaller, themed/normal games. Usually no more than 12-15. I tend to use more meta on the other site than I use here, so I had to make the transition here. So far I'm 2-1 with this game still there. This game could still easily go either way. scum needs 2 Mislynches (or mislynch and no lynch) and we need 2 lynches, or any PRs that we have to get the right targets.<br><br>In regards to stats on hitting scum, the ideal % is AT LEAST 50% when you're playing town. When you're mafia/third-party it doesn't really matter. So, you're not too far off. If we find scum today, that puts us in a phenomenal position tomorrow. But if we mislynch today, it's not the end of the world."}

Figure out how you are going to do it.</div></blockquote>There's a bit of inconsistency here. I didn't comment on it at first because I wanted your reaction to my claim, as I knew it'd probably be harsh, though I didn't imagine it to be this harsh. Firstly, why didn't you ask joker to claim (but he's town anyways)? Secondly, why do you ask the three of us to claim, but refuse to do so yourself?

There's this thing called an \"ISO.\" I'm not doing work for you that I have already stated.

Why are you conveniently near the end of EVERY SINGLE LYNCH? Not last, but near the end. I call bullshit on your hoko incidence, I call bullshit on your fake claim, because I know it's fake. I've been rather open with my reads, and I even debriefed after I claimed why I did certain things. Here, let me explain something else for you:<br><br>\"Would you do a 1-for-1?\"<br><br>So, this is the most debated topic in the game, is it not? It is an extremely scummy move on my part, is it not? Now, let me explain:<br>1. I stated I only cared about integrity &amp; reactions.

Am I stupid enough to do such a thing? I didn't want a target painted on my back, so I denied it.

If you are scum, you'd keep me alive. If anyone but you was scum, they'd have shot me. My death would mean your death, because you fabricate something to say I'm a fake cop, and you're wrong. It shows you have something to hide.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Instead thez has the nerve to prove my prediction correct.</div></blockquote>I have a lot of backbone and do a lot of questionable things, but I wouldn't do even that.<br><br>Now, here's another thing. You failed to mention Haze. Is that because you know you don't stand a chance there? I kept everyone (or tried to, at least) from voting for Haze, and instead to look at BP."}
