After a moment of panic he leans up ward from his prone position and makes out 13 distinct faces. As his senses start to return to him he notices they are squabbling and shouting names. \"Where am I?!\" shouts Nunez at the mob but they do not know anymore than he. It is soon made clear the only way to escape is to kill our captors. The quills on his back begin to stand on edge; what would anyone want with me? I'm just a boring old hedgehog... the thoughts raced through his mind like a formula 1 car."}

He could see a bunch of different people arguing over something incomprehensible. \"What is this?\" he thought, as he began slowly performing his morning routine. He gently stroked the underbelly of his now rock hard shaft, caressing the balls with his other hairy hand. Back and forth, back and forth, his hand went - and all seemed normal until, suddenly, baboon had a chilling realization. He realized he would not be able to shake his current state of agitation - that  the vague lack of fulfillment that pervaded his very existence would never be exsanguinated. \"I must stroke harder!\" he thought, his irritation and savagery ever increasing. \"HARDER!\" he bellowed. But baboon knew, from that very moment, that something was dreadfully wrong. Something had to be purged - to be cleansed - before his life would ever be the same... again."}

Thats sounds freak to me...<br><br>What I posted so far is the little thing i feel scummy about, I have read the other stuff but doesn't mean that i will have to sit and write comments for each one. I would do to which ever post i think that i need quote and post about it."}

Acts like he knows how I play.<br><br>side note - he and i have played in 1 game together. he was scum and i was  town. I correctly names BOTH of his scum partners AND the Sk in that game. I was able to get 1 of his partners lynched and ALMOST able to get his 2nd partner lynched day 1. The ONLY reason I didn't think he was scum that game is because he did something that most scum won't do. he day 1 hammered a power role, something I have only really seen from town.<br><br>so to imply that i am going to be useless is a boldface lie cause in my experience with him I was nowhere close to being useless.<br><br>3. instead of questioning me he votes goodbar which seems like was sticking to his preplanned agenda. he tried to push goodbar early day 1 by calling him out for lurking, which is funny because I would have not called a player who had not posted at all lurking. I'd have called that player inactive and asked the mod to prod that player. But peta on the other hand disappears for nearly 100 posts before he votes goodbar. Disappearing for nearly 100 posts is more like lurking imo. It's like he was projecting his guilt onto someone else.<br><br>4. he did absolutely no scum hunting day 1.<br><br>I'm saying the scumteam is Peta, nunez, and rmp.<br><br>let's see if I am right."}

He never did, he replaced out for inactivity. Nero comes in and votes and that's enough for you to keep your vote on him cause in your mind he should have provided a reason. What I want to know though is why were you willing to excuse Turqoise's inactivity but never willing to accept baboons?

Why would you keep asking me for my reasons but weren't willing to do the same for nero day 1<br><br>186/188 - this is more of the thinking nunez is scummy but not actually willing to vote him and certainly there is no examples of you even trying to question him.

You also tell him that he should \"elaborate\" \"ask questions\" or \"scum hunt\" and you put them in quotation marks to make it seem like you aren't being accusatory. I feel like you should have asked him point blank to elaborate if that is what you wanted from him. I feel like you should have told him to scum hunt in the similar way you told Nunez (which is different than the way you told psyche)<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">I put them in quotations because he put something in quotations in the post before. I was poking fun at him. He says: 'you should, like, \"explain this\"' before I do the quote thing. Regardless I was not liking the way he didn't explain his vote. Again. As always. I don't like it when people have no basis for their votes. Thats it. That's all there is to say. Its how I always am and how I always will be.</span><br><br>post 181 - I don't know why you kept your vote on baboon/nero when you clearly said earlier it was to see if he would post something. He never did, he replaced out for inactivity. Nero comes in and votes and that's enough for you to keep your vote on him cause in your mind he should have provided a reason. What I want to know though is why were you willing to excuse Turqoise's inactivity but never willing to accept baboons? Also why did nero not providing a reason warrant you to keep your vote on him and not unvote and ask him for his reasons. Why would you keep asking me for my reasons but weren't willing to do the same for nero day 1<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Turquoise voted in RVS. baboon came in wrote some bullshit and didnt participate. Nero replaced baboon. I felt that nero replacing baboon and both nero and baboon being scummy did warrant my vote.</span><br><br>186/188 - this is more of the thinking nunez is scummy but not actually willing to vote him and certainly there is no examples of you even trying to question him. This is classic n00b distancing.  Nero/rmp very likely scum together.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">First I was scum with nunez, now I'm scummy with nero? Clearly I tried multiple times to get nunez to explain his vote and thoughts and to out reasoning and scumhunt. Just because it wasn't in question format every time I said it doesn't mean I wasn't trying to get him to explain. Sorry but maybe it's just me. Every time someone mentions my name I notice and if it is calling me scum I will definitely respond.</span><br><br>post 190 - \"it's scummy if people don't give a reason for their vote\" This is just wrong and the fact that you are even making a statement considering your weak ass reasonings for your votes is very scummy.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Can you quote me directly next time please \"At this point in the game I find it to be scummy not to support your vote, even if it is for a reaction test.\"<br><br>I do still feel this way. I always will. i want support. I'm looking for substance. I realize some people don't play that way, but if you do, I'm going to ask you to support your vote. If you refuse I will find it scummy. Whether it makes you scum is a different story. Again as I said I need multiple reasons to vote someone typically. Before you bring up Nero, I had multiple reasons. 1. Baboon was scummy. 2. Nero didn't support his vote. 3. Nero didn't participate in the game.</span><br><br>post 240 - I find it weird that despite his growing wagon, you don't want to have any part in voting gif and instead you keep your vote on nero who had also gone inactive. Parking votes on people who aren't around to answer your questions is a good way for scum to appear like they are trying because they can easily pass the blame. You mention finding GIR and Nunez yet you don't even try to pressure those guys. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">I do mention finding them scummy, but I wasn't going to BW GIF because again, I didn't see enough of a reason to vote him, as I said in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4858534#p4858534\">181</a></span><br><br>303 - your vote for nero wasn't very good so the fact you go right back to it is just lazy. You don't even attempt to question anyone. Going back to what you said earlier about voting, this vote seems weird.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">I wanted Nero to explain. I also didn't want GIF hammered so quickly. In case you didn't notice it happened while I was not online. He was at L-3 last I knew before he was hammered. Also as I said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4859116#p4859116\">240</a> I found both Nero and Nunez scummier than I found GIF. Hence why I didn't jump the bw. Regardless I wanted more out of Nero and I didn't think the day was ending that fast... so using this against me is so silly.</span></div></div></div><br><br>damn, you are fucking scummier than I had originally thought.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: rmp</span><br><br>one of rmp/nunez should be today's lynches.</div></blockquote><br><br>P-edit: Its fine that you don't want to respond to what I say, but just know that I have a right to defend myself. Again, your FOS on me is completely off base, and if you lead town to another lynch of someone who is town I'm pretty sure they're going to be rather unhappy.<br><br>Also I find it funny that you are so sure you won't change your mind. In my experience only scum think they actually know the scum. You seem so confident... Unfortunately I think you might just be mistaken town, which is very sad for us."}

O please, you know I've been participating. My point here is that I've been participating and even scumhunting. All you need to do is look at the vote count and the days where the game was literally DEAD to see who I'm talking about.<br><br>2. I'm not 'going out of me way' to appeal to you. I'm responding to you, just as I have been responding to everyone who asks me a question. Bomberman- You're not special. Stop acting like you are.<br><br>3. WHY I THINK he is scum. It was the only read I was getting at the time. there wasn't much to look at. Again, as people start to participate, you get more reads. So yeah I have a right to change my mind on who I'd like to lynch. I never said i was against a Nero lynch I just said I wasn't sure. I'm entitled to change my mind. I'll never be sure about a vote. I'm not against a Nero lynch point I just think that lynching me to get a read on him his pointless. Better to just lynch him and see if I'm right, which I'm not sure I am.<br><br>My point is that I'm not against a nero lynch but I am against an arc lynch.<br><br>With my vote reasoning, yeah sometimes you gotta call people scummy to get a reaction. I wasn't getting a reaction and that is PART of why I unvoted him. Also because I'm not sure.<br><br>I'm not voting him because I didn't want a bw on him. I realize you unvoted first but he was still left at L-2 which I don't like when I'm not around to see things unfold.<br><br>Arc put him at L-1<br>Bomberman Unvoted<br>I unvoted<br><br>at the top of page 23 Goodbar says I was one of the last to unvote him. I was 2nd to unvote him. That was a misrep. You can all look back to posts 479-521 for that, all of which I was gone for and thus couldn't unvote otherwise I would have before bomberman. I don't like to see people get to L-1 the way that nero did.<br><br>Point is I never said i was sure... he wasn't helping town and I see some town in most of the other people in the game, or at least I did before activity picked up again. <br><br>Anything else there, bomberman?"}

If a townie wants someone lynched, I don't take it that they're going to sit on their ass about it. Or at least, in a normal game. This game isn't normal, and as peta put it, it's objectively one of the worst I've played. That aside, I'm sure you can all understand a townie disposition rather a scum one, right? right? Some things are pretty blatant about RMP. She's not consistent. Furthermore, even if she was consistent the content actually produced is bar <span style=\"font-style: italic\">none.</span> She doesn't take the notion to actually read someone or make a conclusion and in the end it's all a bunch of bullshit. She's not willing to give out content and solidify her reads <span class=\"noboldsig\">until</span> someone pushes her. I don't need to bring up a wall on this because if you ISO her, it's obvious. This is all obvious. It frustrates me to no end that Goodbar comes in here and goes \"WELL THEY DIDN'T BUS LOL\" Because that was literally, no, i fucking mean it, <span class=\"noboldsig\">literally</span> a bus. If you somehow see that <span class=\"noboldsig\">RMP SUDDENLY WANTED TO UNVOTE HER SCUMREAD FOR ALMOST ALL OF D2 AFTER GUILTYING HER AND TRYING TO INCRIMINATE HER THEN YOU DON'T FUCKING DESERVE TO PLAY MAFIA.</span> This is the literal fucking defintion of NoobScum.

At all? Just a couple of reminders here and there.

In short, he's been one of the more vocal players yet I haven't had any reason to view anything he says as bullshit, opportunistic, etc. that would characterize as scum. He's been logical to me and we've seemed to agree on certain things too which makes me feel good.<br><br>One recent thing in particular I found townie was his push rmpeacoc the day Nero claimed - I feel like at that point Nero was bound to get lynched and I'm not sure why scum wouldn't just take the opportunity to bus. You could say he was playing the stupid card but he actually does have a good case on rmpeacoc. I also don't think it's totally extraordinary - maybe even optimal - for someone in Nero's position to bus at the last minute. It was convincing enough to sound like a last ditch effort without being effective enough to actually work."}

He continues to say I didn't unvote Nero because I thought he was still at L-2... when I clearly explained that I didn't realize Demon had been voting Nero.<br>7. Apparently I act like i'm immune because I've been participating. My point right there is that I prefer when I have a ml to get rid of people who aren't helping the game. This gives me time to get a better read on people who ARE participating. All I was saying is I was a poor lynch decision because the game would literally die without me (and it really would, lets face it).<br>8. I changed my story about why I didn't see Demon's vote (Doesn't matter what I said. I didn't see demon's vote. Regardless I was sleeping or at work and wasn't online.<br>9.
