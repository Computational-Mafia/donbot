Do not personally attack, threaten, or be excessively rude to other players. Likewise, if another player is insulting or criticizing you, take it maturely as long as it's in the spirit of the game.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">6)</div> Either bold your votes or use the vote tag (for example, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">VOTE: Phenenas</div>). Unbolded votes will not count. You do not have to unvote before voting a different player, but it would be appreciated. You cannot, under any circumstances, vote yourself.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">7)</div> If the majority of the players vote for one player to be lynched, the day ends. You may also vote for nobody to be lynched during the day by posting <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">VOTE: No Lynch</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">8)</div> Days will, at the moment, last a maximum of 2 weeks, but can be shorter if a lynch or no lynch is voted before then. If the deadline is reached, nobody will be lynched, Night phase will commence, and any votes posted after the deadline will be ignored. I will consider extending the deadline upon request. Nights will last 48 hours. If you do not PM me your night action, if you have one, within that time period, it will not count. If you wish to take no action that night, it would be greatly appreciated if you informed me via PM.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">9)</div> If you die, you are allowed to make one \"Bah\" post that has <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">no game-altering content</div> in it, but after that, no talking until the game ends.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">10)</div> If you will be unable to be online for an extended period of time, please declare yourself V/LA in the thread, and state how long you expect to be unavailable. If a player does not declare V/LA and has not posted in 48 hours, they will be prodded via PM. They then have 24 hours to post in-thread or they will be replaced out. If a person has been prodded twice and fails again to post for 48 hours, instead of being prodded a third time they will be replaced out.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">11)</div> If you must leave the game, please contact me via PM or say so in bold in the thread.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">12)</div> All roles will be decided using random.org, with absolutely no personal interference on the mod's part.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">13)</div> Play to your win condition. Joking around a little is tolerated and encouraged, but in the end you must try to help your alignment win the game.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">14)</div> These rules are not set in stone. As the mod, I reserve the right to change them as I see fit.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">15)</div> I'm human. I'm not perfect, and will almost certainly make a mistake or two. If I make any mistakes or forget something on a PM I sent you or on an in-thread post, please gently correct me.

I think that sometimes you do just have suspicions but what I'm seeing is a lot of finger pointing with nothing to back it up and I think that could be why people aren't participating. For instance I'd be on top of it more if Jake or someone who sees something I did as scummy would actually say their reasoning and help me to explain, which would in turn allow you guys to get better reads on me by the way that I defend myself.<br>\n<br>\nAnd so I must ask:<br>\n<br>\nArcAngel... what are your reasons for thinking Goodbar is suspicious? <br>\n<br>\nAnd Jake as I've asked multiple times I would like your reasoning for why you put me into a scumteam with Peta and Nunez...", "time": "Mon Apr 15, 2013 11:17 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=27042&start=350", "forum": "53", "thread": "27042"}

He never did, he replaced out for inactivity. Nero comes in and votes and that's enough for you to keep your vote on him cause in your mind he should have provided a reason. What I want to know though is why were you willing to excuse Turqoise's inactivity but never willing to accept baboons?

Why would you keep asking me for my reasons but weren't willing to do the same for nero day 1<br>\n<br>\n186/188 - this is more of the thinking nunez is scummy but not actually willing to vote him and certainly there is no examples of you even trying to question him.

Again, trying to get him to talk... in case you didn't notice he hasn't outed reasoning for anyone he has voted. I'm looking for some real arguments... so yeah, three ?'s. Doesn't make me scummy, just means I wanted an answer.<br>\n<br>\n3. I don't feel like I would have wanted to change my vote. Again, you and I clearly play this game differently. I don't throw my vote on whoever is being scummy in the moment. there is time. I don't need to vote someone for one scummy action.<br>\n<br>\n4. I did agree with the point pranay made, I even commented on it, but I didn't feel like it warranted a vote. Haven't I already said that?<br>\n<br>\n5. Okay then I mispoke (Call it scummy if you want but clearly I'm trying to refute all of your arguments and if that's the only mistake I made I'm fine with it... point is still proven... im not just going to vote someone for one scummy thing...) there is one other case when I will vote and it is just that... when i'm trying to get someone to talk. But as far as actually going for a lynch goes, if I see a bw on the person I'm on I will remove my vote because I didnt actually want the lynch. Regardless just because I think someone says something scummy I'm not going to put my vote on them. They have to do very scummy things more than once for me to want them lynched. You get the point.<br>\n<br>\n6. Again, there are others that I asked to participate and scumhunt, not just him.

You also tell him that he should \"elaborate\" \"ask questions\" or \"scum hunt\" and you put them in quotation marks to make it seem like you aren't being accusatory. I feel like you should have asked him point blank to elaborate if that is what you wanted from him. I feel like you should have told him to scum hunt in the similar way you told Nunez (which is different than the way you told psyche)<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I put them in quotations because he put something in quotations in the post before. I was poking fun at him. He says: 'you should, like, \"explain this\"' before I do the quote thing. Regardless I was not liking the way he didn't explain his vote. Again. As always. I don't like it when people have no basis for their votes. Thats it. That's all there is to say. Its how I always am and how I always will be.</div><br>\n<br>\npost 181 - I don't know why you kept your vote on baboon/nero when you clearly said earlier it was to see if he would post something. He never did, he replaced out for inactivity. Nero comes in and votes and that's enough for you to keep your vote on him cause in your mind he should have provided a reason. What I want to know though is why were you willing to excuse Turqoise's inactivity but never willing to accept baboons? Also why did nero not providing a reason warrant you to keep your vote on him and not unvote and ask him for his reasons. Why would you keep asking me for my reasons but weren't willing to do the same for nero day 1<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Turquoise voted in RVS. baboon came in wrote some bullshit and didnt participate. Nero replaced baboon. I felt that nero replacing baboon and both nero and baboon being scummy did warrant my vote.</div><br>\n<br>\n186/188 - this is more of the thinking nunez is scummy but not actually willing to vote him and certainly there is no examples of you even trying to question him. This is classic n00b distancing.  Nero/rmp very likely scum together.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">First I was scum with nunez, now I'm scummy with nero? Clearly I tried multiple times to get nunez to explain his vote and thoughts and to out reasoning and scumhunt. Just because it wasn't in question format every time I said it doesn't mean I wasn't trying to get him to explain. Sorry but maybe it's just me. Every time someone mentions my name I notice and if it is calling me scum I will definitely respond.</div><br>\n<br>\npost 190 - \"it's scummy if people don't give a reason for their vote\" This is just wrong and the fact that you are even making a statement considering your weak ass reasonings for your votes is very scummy.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Can you quote me directly next time please \"At this point in the game I find it to be scummy not to support your vote, even if it is for a reaction test.\"<br>\n<br>\nI do still feel this way. I always will. i want support. I'm looking for substance. I realize some people don't play that way, but if you do, I'm going to ask you to support your vote. If you refuse I will find it scummy. Whether it makes you scum is a different story. Again as I said I need multiple reasons to vote someone typically. Before you bring up Nero, I had multiple reasons. 1. Baboon was scummy. 2. Nero didn't support his vote. 3. Nero didn't participate in the game.</div><br>\n<br>\npost 240 - I find it weird that despite his growing wagon, you don't want to have any part in voting gif and instead you keep your vote on nero who had also gone inactive. Parking votes on people who aren't around to answer your questions is a good way for scum to appear like they are trying because they can easily pass the blame. You mention finding GIR and Nunez yet you don't even try to pressure those guys. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I do mention finding them scummy, but I wasn't going to BW GIF because again, I didn't see enough of a reason to vote him, as I said in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4858534#p4858534\">181</a></div><br>\n<br>\n303 - your vote for nero wasn't very good so the fact you go right back to it is just lazy. You don't even attempt to question anyone. Going back to what you said earlier about voting, this vote seems weird.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I wanted Nero to explain. I also didn't want GIF hammered so quickly. In case you didn't notice it happened while I was not online. He was at L-3 last I knew before he was hammered. Also as I said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4859116#p4859116\">240</a> I found both Nero and Nunez scummier than I found GIF.

All you need to do is look at the vote count and the days where the game was literally DEAD to see who I'm talking about.<br>\n<br>\n2. I'm not 'going out of me way' to appeal to you. I'm responding to you, just as I have been responding to everyone who asks me a question. Bomberman- You're not special. Stop acting like you are.<br>\n<br>\n3. WHY I THINK he is scum. It was the only read I was getting at the time. there wasn't much to look at. Again, as people start to participate, you get more reads. So yeah I have a right to change my mind on who I'd like to lynch. I never said i was against a Nero lynch I just said I wasn't sure. I'm entitled to change my mind. I'll never be sure about a vote. I'm not against a Nero lynch point I just think that lynching me to get a read on him his pointless. Better to just lynch him and see if I'm right, which I'm not sure I am.<br>\n<br>\nMy point is that I'm not against a nero lynch but I am against an arc lynch.<br>\n<br>\nWith my vote reasoning, yeah sometimes you gotta call people scummy to get a reaction. I wasn't getting a reaction and that is PART of why I unvoted him. Also because I'm not sure.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not voting him because I didn't want a bw on him.

I don't like to see people get to L-1 the way that nero did.<br>\n<br>\nPoint is I never said i was sure... he wasn't helping town and I see some town in most of the other people in the game, or at least I did before activity picked up again. <br>\n<br>\nAnything else there, bomberman?", "time": "Thu Apr 25, 2013 8:02 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=27042&start=575", "forum": "53", "thread": "27042"}

This game isn't normal, and as peta put it, it's objectively one of the worst I've played. That aside, I'm sure you can all understand a townie disposition rather a scum one, right? right? Some things are pretty blatant about RMP. She's not consistent. Furthermore, even if she was consistent the content actually produced is bar <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">none.</div> She doesn't take the notion to actually read someone or make a conclusion and in the end it's all a bunch of bullshit.

I don't need to bring up a wall on this because if you ISO her, it's obvious. This is all obvious.

Apparently I act like i'm immune because I've been participating. My point right there is that I prefer when I have a ml to get rid of people who aren't helping the game. This gives me time to get a better read on people who ARE participating. All I was saying is I was a poor lynch decision because the game would literally die without me (and it really would, lets face it).<br>\n8.
