No one else is to use red.<br>\n<br>\n4) Do not quote any private communications with me or other players. Failure to adhere to this rule will result in a modkill or a forced-replacement. If you have a question about whether something is acceptable, PM me.<br>\n<br>\n5) You may not talk about this game outside the thread unless your role allows. When a player is killed, with the exception of a modkill, they will be given a link to a &#8220;green room.&#8221; In this room, you may chose to keep playing and discussing with other deceased players. If you have a partner/partners, do not disclose their name(s). This thread WILL be posted in post game.<br>\n<br>\n6) Do not edit or delete your posts. You WILL be modkilled.<br>\n<br>\n7) Posting in twilight is acceptable, for both the lynchee and all alive town members. Feel free to post as much or as little as you want of whatever you like.<br>\n<br>\n8) Once your death scene is posted, you may not talk. No &#8216;Bah&#8217; post, or someone on your team will be punished for your screw-up.<br>\n<br>\n9) If you fake breaking a rule, it will incur the same punishment as actually breaking the rule.<br>\n<br>\n10) If you believe I have made a small mistake, for example, in a vote count, please point it out in thread.

More than two prods in the same game day will result in a modkill or a forced replacement, in which I have sole discretion in picking the limit or consequence.<br>\n<br>\n15) I will take exactly 24 hours to find a replacement. If you decide to replace out, please find your own replacee.

The scum have a distinct advantage in this game, and they probably didn't know that choosing a NK last night would lead to a draw. It sucks for them to go from a near certain win to a draw. However, why should the townies risk a near certain loss just to be good sports and give the mafia a victory?<br>\n<br>\nThe only way I would accept the idea of finishing this game without a draw is if the scum evened the odds by having one of their own confess. Assuming we have 2 scum (which is a bit high for an 8 player game unless we have a cop; but 1 scum is far too low for an 8 player game, even without any town PRs): if the mafia sacrifice one scum to a lynch today and NKs tonight, that leaves 1 scum and 3 town, which are close odds for both sides (slightly favor town if a cop exists; if no cop, strongly favors scum).<br>\n<br>\nHowever, the town would then be well advised to no-lynch again, just because it is again MYLO. (side note: GM, why in the world did we start with 8 and not 9? Who does that??? We could be avoiding the interminable no-lynches if this game had started with an odd number) At that point, the scum ought to realize that no-NK does not help their cause (because if a cop exists, they need to kill him; and if no cop exists, they have such a strong advantage that there is no need to risk a draw). So that will leave us with the 1 scum / 2 town endgame that is the hallmark of a well-played, balanced game.<br>\n<br>\nSo, to the scum out there -- that is the choice.

No-lynch is our leverage to force scum to play the way we want them to; why are we letting them force us to play the way they want us to?<br>\n<br>\nI doubt Beck is scum -- of all players in this game, he is one of the most townish. And, as has been pointed out he was the first to push for NL today.<br>\n<br>\nThere are a couple of different ways of looking at it. Try re-reading today's activity with the assumption that Beck is town. SK appears to be town for noting that his top scumread is Beck, but that it isn't worth the risk to lynch him and votes NL instead. But in post #235, CES capitalizes upon SK's stated suspicion to push a Beck lynch (opportunism, the hallmark of scum!). Then in #244, Korts also jumps on the Beck case. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Note that neither of them had ever expressed suspicion of Beck before SK identified him as his top scumread after last night's NK</div> -- and yet both would risk the entire game on sheeping SK's read?!<br>\n<br>\nThe other way of looking at this is mathematically: ceterus paribus, there is a 33% chance Beck is scum. If he is scum, then his partner is almost certainly on his wagon (because even with the loss of one of their own, scum still have an advantage, which is better than a no-lynch; but if he doesn't bus his partner and his partner is lynched anyway, he becomes a suspect tomorrow and loses much of his advantage). But there is a 67% chance Beck is town, in which case both scum are definitely on his wagon already (because if me or Yos were scum we would hammer Beck and win the game).<br>\n<br>\nSo: the odds of Beck being scum are far, far lower than the odds of at least one of his voters being scum. Since SK has acted most townish (and least opportunistic) of the three voters, it is either CES or Korts, or both.<br>\n<br>\nBut until one or the other grows a nutsack and has the guts to confess so we can continue this game, we must no-lynch.
