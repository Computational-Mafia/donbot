Play for fun. Don't be rude to other players.<br><br>2) Play to win, but also to have fun. See rule 1.<br><br>3) I will post in red. No one else is to use red.<br><br>4) Do not quote any private communications with me or other players. Failure to adhere to this rule will result in a modkill or a forced-replacement. If you have a question about whether something is acceptable, PM me.<br><br>5) You may not talk about this game outside the thread unless your role allows. When a player is killed, with the exception of a modkill, they will be given a link to a \u201cgreen room.\u201d In this room, you may chose to keep playing and discussing with other deceased players. If you have a partner/partners, do not disclose their name(s). This thread WILL be posted in post game.<br><br>6) Do not edit or delete your posts. You WILL be modkilled.<br><br>7) Posting in twilight is acceptable, for both the lynchee and all alive town members. Feel free to post as much or as little as you want of whatever you like.<br><br>8) Once your death scene is posted, you may not talk. No \u2018Bah\u2019 post, or someone on your team will be punished for your screw-up.<br><br>9) If you fake breaking a rule, it will incur the same punishment as actually breaking the rule.<br><br>10) If you believe I have made a small mistake, for example, in a vote count, please point it out in thread. If you have a more serious grievance for some reason, PM me. Leave it out of the thread.<br><br>11) My word is final.<br><br>13) I reserve the right to add rules if necessary.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Activity:</span><br><br>14) I expect everyone to post every 24 hours (weekends are considered only 24hrs total). Failure to do so will result in an activity prod. I will prod and if there is no post within 12 hours of prod, you will be replaced. More than two prods in the same game day will result in a modkill or a forced replacement, in which I have sole discretion in picking the limit or consequence.<br><br>15) I will take exactly 24 hours to find a replacement. If you decide to replace out, please find your own replacee. If, after the 24 hours is up, I will modkill the slot for stagnation (from initial inactivity to this point is exactly 1/2 game day), and the player may not join any more quick games I may mod.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting/Deadline:</span><br><br>14) To vote. Please vote in bold as such. vote: playerA. You do not have to unvote to vote again. You may vote for a no lynch. For voting accuracy, I ask that you place your vote at the beginning or the end of your post (this is not mandatory, but it would be appreciated).<br><br>15) Deadline will be exactly 5 days from the death scene, every day.<br><br>16) At deadline, majority is cut in half (D1 deadline would be 8 players / 2 = 4 players = 3 to lynch. If there is a tie, the player with the most votes first, will be lynched.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Town Win Condition:</span></span></span><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You win when all other factions are eliminated and at least one person in your faction is alive, or nothing can prevent the same.</div></blockquote>"}

It would kind of make this whole game seem like a pointless waste of time, but hey, at least it'll piss off the scum and, next time we run this setup, the scum will think twice before no-killing when they're ahead.<br><br>That being said, before we think about resorting to that, we should probably do a mass-claim; and if anyone has a suspect that they're really confident is scum, I want to hear it.  If we have information that could help us lynch right today, it improves the odds a little.    Just be prepared for scum to gambit if we mass-claim; I guarantee you, the scum will NOT want to let us no-lynch."}

The scum have a distinct advantage in this game, and they probably didn't know that choosing a NK last night would lead to a draw. It sucks for them to go from a near certain win to a draw. However, why should the townies risk a near certain loss just to be good sports and give the mafia a victory?<br><br>The only way I would accept the idea of finishing this game without a draw is if the scum evened the odds by having one of their own confess. Assuming we have 2 scum (which is a bit high for an 8 player game unless we have a cop; but 1 scum is far too low for an 8 player game, even without any town PRs): if the mafia sacrifice one scum to a lynch today and NKs tonight, that leaves 1 scum and 3 town, which are close odds for both sides (slightly favor town if a cop exists; if no cop, strongly favors scum).<br><br>However, the town would then be well advised to no-lynch again, just because it is again MYLO. (side note: GM, why in the world did we start with 8 and not 9? Who does that??? We could be avoiding the interminable no-lynches if this game had started with an odd number) At that point, the scum ought to realize that no-NK does not help their cause (because if a cop exists, they need to kill him; and if no cop exists, they have such a strong advantage that there is no need to risk a draw). So that will leave us with the 1 scum / 2 town endgame that is the hallmark of a well-played, balanced game.<br><br>So, to the scum out there -- that is the choice. Confess and we can continue with a chance for either side to win; or we can no-lynch today and draw."}

No-lynch is our leverage to force scum to play the way we want them to; why are we letting them force us to play the way they want us to?<br><br>I doubt Beck is scum -- of all players in this game, he is one of the most townish. And, as has been pointed out he was the first to push for NL today.<br><br>There are a couple of different ways of looking at it. Try re-reading today's activity with the assumption that Beck is town. SK appears to be town for noting that his top scumread is Beck, but that it isn't worth the risk to lynch him and votes NL instead. But in post #235, CES capitalizes upon SK's stated suspicion to push a Beck lynch (opportunism, the hallmark of scum!). Then in #244, Korts also jumps on the Beck case. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Note that neither of them had ever expressed suspicion of Beck before SK identified him as his top scumread after last night's NK</span> -- and yet both would risk the entire game on sheeping SK's read?!<br><br>The other way of looking at this is mathematically: ceterus paribus, there is a 33% chance Beck is scum. If he is scum, then his partner is almost certainly on his wagon (because even with the loss of one of their own, scum still have an advantage, which is better than a no-lynch; but if he doesn't bus his partner and his partner is lynched anyway, he becomes a suspect tomorrow and loses much of his advantage). But there is a 67% chance Beck is town, in which case both scum are definitely on his wagon already (because if me or Yos were scum we would hammer Beck and win the game).<br><br>So: the odds of Beck being scum are far, far lower than the odds of at least one of his voters being scum. Since SK has acted most townish (and least opportunistic) of the three voters, it is either CES or Korts, or both.<br><br>But until one or the other grows a nutsack and has the guts to confess so we can continue this game, we must no-lynch. SK, please change your vote to no-lynch until one of the scum confesses."}

CES and Korts hopped on the wagon before it was the popular thing to do, effectively short-circuiting the no-lynch wagon -- this is plausible as scum would not want to no-lynch to a draw.

Best case scenario is (a), but even in that case our odds of killing a scum before MYLO are only about 57% (2/7 on Day 1, 2/5 on Day 2). If the vig tries a kill on Night 2, he has a 2/5 chance of hitting a scum, which -- again, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">in the best case scenario</span> -- which means we could survive a mislynch and this brings our total odds of killing a scum before LYLO to 74%. Sounds pretty good, right? Except this only brings us to a 3-person LYLO, with its corresponding 33% chance of victory.

This setup was clearly neither breakable nor nearly-unwinnable for either side.<br>(b) If we did have such rules, it would generally be difficult to evaluate EV's anyways. For this calculation, I had to make some assumptions, such as the vig claiming Day 1, which makes me think the real EV would probably be slightly higher (though still less than 40%, certainly), and the scum killing the vig on Night 1. Most setups are more complicated, mostly because there are a variety of strategies that town PR's can employ and ways that towns can respond to PR claims."}

From what I've seen, EV is pretty accurate over the long run and variations are far more attributable to superior players stacked on one side or the other. The idea that town outperforms EV is frequently the argument of those cite town for poor scumhunting after a town-loss -- the point of view that victory or defeat is derivative of town effort, as if scum are passive in the game. But they aren't; beyond their obvious NK capabilities, they are <span style=\"font-style: italic\">part of the town</span> during the day and get an equal vote in directing the lynch. In short, scum get 100% of the say in who they NK; but town does not get 100% of the say in who they lynch. EV is based on randomness, as if town were just rolling the dice to see who they lynch; when in fact, the lynch is based on the flawed voting behavior of uninformed townies and the manipulations of informed scum. Even astute scumhunting struggles to overcome these manipulations.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3442261#p3442261\" class=\"postlink\">post 379</a>, Herodotus wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3442126#p3442126\" class=\"postlink\">post 377</a>, Ironhead wrote:</cite>Since there is no other cop, we believe him</div></blockquote>I think this is a misguided way to evaluate claims, and that your own example demonstrates that.</div></blockquote><br>Of course; what I described was the best case scenario.<br><br>Yet still; if someone claims cop, there is no counterclaim, and can provide 100% accurate investigation reports (or claims of being role-blocked), would he be your top candidate for a lynch?"}
