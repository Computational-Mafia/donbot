    "Rather than being very strict about what counts as a vote (ie looking for proper vote formatting and exact target naming), this function is intended to work like human moderators do, or at least have over the D1s of ~300 Mini Normal Games studied to produce the function. The VoteExtractor class has been found to accurately predict which player a moderator assigned a lynch to across nearly all of these studied games - all without relying on any explicit database of aliases.\n",

    "If aliases are *totally* necessary to understand the target of a vote (for example, when someone uses a user's true first name instead of some nickname based on their username), though, VoteExtracter is a bit more likely to fail. In order to include aliases in VoteExtracter functioning, add any desired aliases to the list of players included when you initialize an instance of the class. A cleaner option, though, might be to ban votes that require such contextual knowledge to interpret their target.\n",

    "### English Divides\n",
    "The function `englishdivides()` returns a list of ways the input playername can be divided into strings considered legal words by one of the spellchecker dictionaries, with the list sorted from least to greatest by number of divisions. The spellchecker often accepts as legal many single character and two-character strings that I wouldn't recognize as actual words, so this sorting is important. The result is a data structure helpful for predicting how users might abbreviate or otherwise fail to totally specify a player's name in their vote (eg, \"FB\" for \"Firebringer\"). \n",

    "Strangely, the full list is often sufficient for predicting errors/abbreviations of usernames that aren't even straightforward compositions of 'legal' english words. Maybe our english-langauge vocabularies play a role in structuring mistaken spellings of non-english language strings."

Votes can also often be broken up into multiple lines or otherwise made remote from the naming of a vote's target.\n",
