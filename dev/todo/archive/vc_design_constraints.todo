Design constraints for votecounter.

User story:
    - Someone provides slot information, special events, start_point, end_point, and a thread url.
    - We retrieve posts, initialize votecount and votecounter.
    - Then we process each post, and update the votecount and votecounter.

High-Level Separation of Concerns for an Integrated Votecounter class:
    - Parametrization
    - Initialization -- Initialize a votecount and voteextractor instance
    - Processing -- Process each post and update the votecount and votecounter
    - Event handling -- Handle special events and update the votecount and votecounter
    - Halting -- Halt the processing and return the votecount and votecounter
    - Output -- Return the final votecount instance
    - Post-processing -- Complete task using data inside the votecount instance

Components:
    - Client parametrizes and deals with post-processing
    - Separate votecount class for representing and updating the votecount
    - Separate voteextractor class for extracting votes from posts
    - Wrapper votecounter class for initializing, processing, and halting the votecount and voteextractor given posts, etc.

VoteExtractor Components:
    âœ˜ Extracting relevant text from html. @cancelled(24-04-06 07:37)
    - Detecting vote tags (as well as broken tags) in the text without identifying the voted
    - Identifying the voted slot from contents of relevant text

Optimizing Test Case Extraction:
    First I run the test. 
    Usually error is not found until my assert statement at very end of loop.
    I then manually print the votelog in the debugger.
    I currently scan through the votelog and the thread for ignored votes.
    Then I edit a conditional breakpoint to focus on a specific post.
    Then I step through the code to find a specific error.

    Maybe I can stick to moving the error to my list before interpreting.

So what now?:
    I have the skeleton for the vote extractor class and the entire votecount object. 
    I should probably implement the votecounter class next.
