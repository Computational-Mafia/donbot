Hi Llama. The query "TMHS" is not a valid player name. Please respond with only the valid player name from this list:
players = [
        "EmpTyger",
        "Nul",
        "Substrike22",
        "Llamarble",
        "Pinewolf",
        "Amor",
        "Scott Brosius",
        "Internet Stranger",
        "themanhimself",
        "Guderian",
        "RobCapone",
        "Shattered Viewpoint",
        "chkflip",
        "WeirdRa",
        "brokenscraps",
        "Kingcheese",
    ]

One of these players were named using the query "TMHS". Please respond with the correct player name.

Here is an email: <email>OK, we have a time (12:30 Feb 19th)

Olly, Tom has approved ordering lunch for this group of students and I so can you please take their panera order a few days before to get it delivered for this time?

We can actually meet in my office, I've got what we need to sit 8 of us in there (used to do it with the lab in the before times)  :-) 

thanks
