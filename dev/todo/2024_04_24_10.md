Players in a forum-based game have usernames that are unique and can be up to 20 characters long. The usernames can contain letters, numbers, and special characters. In the game, players vote for each other by referring to each other's usernames inside special tags. For example, if a player named "Alice" wants to vote for a player named "Bob", she would write `[vote]Bob[/vote]` in her post. Players frequently use abbreviations, acronyms, or other forms of shorthand to refer to each other, so the username inside the tags may not always match the actual username. And sometimes content inside vote tags might not actually express a vote, or may include additional text besides the username.

I'm implementing a vote parser that matches text inside vote tags to player usernames. The parser should be able to match usernames even if they are abbreviated, contain typos, or are otherwise not an exact match. The parser should also be able to handle cases where the text inside the vote tags is not a username, or where the text inside the vote tags is not a complete username.

So far I've conceptualized my vote parser as applying a sequence of matching strategies to the text inside the vote tags. For example, I might have a strategy that matches using edit distance, by checking for substring relations between votestrings and playernames, and by predicting acronyms of player usernames. I would apply these strategies in a specific order, and if a strategy fails to match, I would move on to the next strategy or increase the matching threshold. To avoid false positives, I'd start with the minimum possible matching threshold and gradually increase it as needed, only accepting matchings if a strategy only identifies a single player.

My current problem is to find a robust way to mix these strategies. For example, some votes might have a mix of misspellings, abbreviations, and substring relations that uniquely identify a player's username but if not simultaneously considered, might not be matched. For example, someone might vote for the player "dedicatedscribe" with the string "VOTE: Dscrub and I won't change my mind". In this case, the parser should be able to focus on the "Dscrub" part of the string and match it to "dedicatedscribe" by understanding that "D" can be an abbreviation for "dedicated" and "scrub" is a misspelling of "scribe". The parser should also be able to avoid false positives using its matching threshold.

I'm thinking of a strategy that involves recursion in a way that works like tree traversal. At each depth of the tree, player usernames are split into components based on punctuation and english language rules. At the top level, I don't do any splitting. At the second level I add one level of (principled) splitting, and so on. For example, "dedicatedscribe" would be split into "dedicated" and "scribe" because those are two words that can be found in the English language. As another example, "Scott Brosius" would be split into two words based on the whitespace between them and capitalization rules. At deeper levels of splitting, "themanhimself" might go from being split into "['the', 'man', 'himself']" to "['the', 'man', 'him', 'self']".

As I consider each level, I attempt to match votestrings to playernames by generating possible abbreviations or low-distance mispellings of name components and checking for a direct match or substring relation in the votestring. For example, "['dedicated', 'scribe']" can be abbreviated to combinations of "D" and 1-character mispellings of "scribe". I also consider the possibility of components being excluded from the abbreviation, so "['dedicated', 'scribe']" could be abbreviated to just "scribe". I would then recursively apply this strategy to each level of the tree, and if a match is found, I would return the match. If no match is found or too many matches are found, I would move on to the next level of the tree.

Let's think of an incremental implementation.
At base level, I directly compare votestring to playernames using rules:
    - match_by_distance (0 then 1 threshold)
    - match_by_playername_contains_vote
    - match_by_vote_contains_playername
    - match_by_first_letter_abbreviation (acronym)

Think of this as the single-component case.

At level 1, I split playernames into "first-level" components. I look for the minimal segmentation(s) possible, preferring 2-component splittings over 3-component splittings and so on. When usernames use whitespace to convey three words, e.g., "Dr Scott Brosius", I can split into "['Dr Scott', 'Brosius"]" and other 2-element splittings instead of the natural "['Dr', 'Scott', 'Brosius']" three-lement splitting.

Then I apply the same rules as the base level to each component and the same votestring. I guess the question is -- how? By creating variations, or something else?

I guess first I apply the same matching rules but for each component. For example, I check if the votestring is a near match to 'Scott'. 

And then I consider combinations of component abbrevations. For example, I check if the votestring is a near match to 'DrSB'. At deeper levels I should also consider the possibility of one component being excluded from the abbreviation, so I check if the votestring is a near match to 'SB'. I think the variations will always be first-letter abbreviations or exclusions or minor mispellings. 

Hmmm. How do I modularize this?

Oh, god, this is too complicated. I'm never going to finish this...

I need to peg this to a specific test or set of tests I'm trying to pass.
What is the exact problem?

Let's implement the stress tests first. 
But ugh stop thinking about this for several days please.
