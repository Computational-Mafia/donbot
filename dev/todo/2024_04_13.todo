Key problem is that I want exhaustive test cases for the votecounter, but am finding it pretty time-consuming to recapitulate all the possible scenarios.

Current approach?
I hit an error. 
I visually compare the votelog against the actual votes to see what went wrong.
I extract the offending post into a new test case.
Then I fix the bug and run the test again.

How can I accelerate this process?
It's probably the process of identifying the offending post that is the most time-consuming.
Then I manually create a new test case for it. Perhaps I could automate this process?
That would involve a bit of metaprogramming; not sure if it's worth it.

Maybe a collection of watch variables are enough. 
I think actually the thing that would help most is an improvement over the votelog that allows me to directly compare moderator-posted votecounts against system-generated votecounts.

And also, of course, to efficiently jump to specific votes to see if they really happened.

An important caveat is to avoid hatchet jobs on the votecounter.
