Library features:
    - Check for new PMs
        Mostly needed for testing send_pm. Not clearly useful for research.
    - user_id getter that doesn't requirement a post number or authentication
    - Use pprint inside URL to make scraping more efficient

Use cases to support:
    - Votecounting
    - VCA helper
    - Page topper
    - Think about what else I might want to do with the bot

Development Flow:
    - Can I make providing a new release easier?
        Right now it's a separate step beyond pushing the code to the repo.
    - Can I make syncing colab notebooks and library easier?
        Right now, I update the script and then copy it into the colab notebook.
    - Should I integrate client-facing functions into the library, including tests?
        It might help make sure that client code is always up-to-date with the library.

Documentation for Users, Developers, Contributors:
    - Plan a docsite with a minimal API reference. Or just a demo notebook.
    - Document how to make a new release; developer guide? Contribution guide.
    - Start a changelog
    - Commit to semantic commit messages

Decisions:
    âœ” How much votecounter development goes into donbot? @20m @started(24-02-18 22:13) @done(24-02-18 22:22) @lasted(9m28s)
        All of it, but not the research project itself.

Human Tasks:
    - New release
